3809,"A new certificate from Simon Fraser University will allow any undergraduate student from faculties across the university to add innovation and entrepreneurship training to their education. The Certificate in Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CIE) will teach students numerous skills, including creativity, adaptability, teamwork, collaboration, communication, and implementation - all skills that are increasingly sought after by potential employers. 

It will also help students to develop the innovation and entrepreneurship skills necessary for those interested in establishing their own startups. 

Using a unique, interdisciplinary approach to entrepreneurship, the CIE has been designed to build the multi-faceted teams required for realistic entrepreneurship experience, while teaching students that entrepreneurship belongs in every discipline. 

Launched this fall and with an official kickoff event at the SFU Surrey campus later this week (Sept. 24 at 4:30 p.m.), the CIE is designed to be customizable and work with the student's primary degree. 

""By partnering with faculties across SFU we are able to offer students the interdisciplinary teams and skills that realistic, practical innovation requires,"" says Sarah Lubik, SFU's Director of Entrepreneurship and lecturer in the Beedie School of Business. 

""To be successful in business, the ability to innovate and make new things happen is no longer optional. SFU's certificate is a uniquely collaborative answer to that need, and we're seeing great enthusiasm from both students and faculty members."" 

The CIE is offered by SFU's Beedie School of Business in partnership with the faculties of Applied Sciences; Communication, Art and Technology; Environment; Science; and Health Sciences. 

After completing a new introductory interdisciplinary entrepreneurship course, participating students take foundational courses delivered by the Beedie School of Business. 

Following this, they take courses delivered by partner faculties to provide sector specific knowledge and experience, such as The Science of Brewing, Mechatronics Design, Interaction Design Methods, or The Canadian Health System. 

The program concludes with one of several entrepreneurial capstone courses where students execute their own projects. 

Lubik says the CIE's interdisciplinary model utilizes new experiential teaching methods. Students work to solve sustainability problems in their communities, develop and launch real products, and work with real life entrepreneurs, including clients of SFU's student incubator Venture Connection. 

Students are also able to work alongside existing SFU entrepreneurship programs including Tech Entrepreneurship@SFU and Change Lab. 

Lubik adds: ""Through this experiential approach, students will learn to find market-driven solutions to social and environmental challenges.""

9:45 p.m. 

Switzerland is banning sales of Volkswagen Group cars with outdated emissions systems in the wake of the emissions-rigging scandal that started in the United States. 

Thomas Rohrbach, spokesman for the Swiss federal office of roadways, says Friday that the ban is on all cars with diesel engines in the ""euro 5"" emissions category. It includes all VW models — as well as Seat, Skodas and others in the VW group. 

But the ban only affects cars not yet sold or registered, not ones already in circulation. It doesn't apply to cars now in production with ""euro 6"" engines, which aren't affected by the emissions scandal. 

Rohrbach said the ban potentially could affect 180,000 vehicles that have 1.2-liter, 1.6-liter and 2.0-liter diesel engines. 

--- 

9 p.m. 

Volkswagen says the 11 million vehicles worldwide that contain software involved in the emissions-rigging scandal include some 5 million cars made by its core Volkswagen brand. 

The Volkswagen Group includes 12 brands, and the company has yet to detail fully what cars where were involved. A Volkswagen statement Friday said some diesel models and model years — such as the sixth-generation Golf, seventh-generation Passat and first-generation Tiguan — are equipped exclusively with the EA 189 engines in which it says there are ""discrepancies."" 

It didn't detail where in the world the 5 million Volkswagens were sold. 

Volkswagen brand chief Herbert Diess says ""we are working at full speed on a technical solution that we will present to partners, to our customers and to the public as swiftly as possible."" 

--- 

7:20 p.m. 

Volkswagen says it is reorganizing its North America business under Winfried Vahland, until now chairman of the board of directors at Skoda. 

The company says Michael Horn will remain as president and CEO of Volkswagen Group of America, but its U.S, Canada and Mexico markets will be ""combined and significantly strengthened"" to form a new ""North America region."" 

--- 

6:50 p.m. 

Incoming Volkswagen CEO Matthias Mueller is pledging to do everything to win back the trust of the public in the wake of the emissions scandal that erupted in the U.S. 

He said after being appointed to the job on Friday that ""we stand by our responsibility."" He also said, however, that ""carefulness is even more important than speed."" 

Mueller said the company would introduce ""even tougher compliance rules"" and pledged to make VW ""an even stronger company."" 

--- 

6:40 p.m. 

Volkswagen AG has chosen the head of its Porsche division, Matthias Mueller, to succeed Martin Winterkorn as chief executive. 

Volkswagen's supervisory board appointed the 62-year-old Mueller, a longtime company insider, on Friday. 

Winterkorn resigned on Wednesday, taking responsibility for the car emissions scandal in the U.S. but saying he wasn't aware of any wrongdoing on his own part. 

--- 

3:50 p.m. 

Czech Transport Ministry says it is awaiting information from Volkswagen about how many of the EA 189 diesel engines at the center of the company's emissions-rigging scandal were used in Skoda Auto vehicles. 

Friday's announcement comes after Skoda Auto, a Czech carmaker owned by VW, acknowledged it used the engines in the past. 

It didn't give any further details except that they are not used anymore. 

It's not clear whether those Skoda cars cheated on any emissions tests. 

The ministry says it is in touch with counterparts in Germany and Britain, where Skoda cars received the necessary clearance for use in the European markets. 

--- 

3:40 p.m. 

The European Union wants quick answers as to how Volkswagen was able to use stealth software in its vehicles so they could pass lab tests on emission pollution standards. 

The top official responsible for the European single market, Elzbieta Bienkowska, said Friday that ""we need full disclosure and robust pollutant emissions tests in place."" 

Germany, Italy and France are among the countries known to be investigating, and the commission says their probes would include carmakers beyond VW. 

The EU plans to introduce new emissions tests next year involving on-road monitoring. They would complement the lab tests currently used.

3:25 p.m. 

Germany's transport minister says 2.8 million vehicles in Germany were among those containing software at the center of the emissions-rigging scandal that started in the United States. 

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has accused VW of installing the so-called ""defeat device"" used to cheat emissions tests in 482,000 cars sold in the United States. 

VW later acknowledged that similar software exists in 11 million diesel vehicles worldwide, but hasn't given details of the models and their whereabouts. 

Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt told lawmakers Friday that 2.8 million of the vehicles were in Germany, news agency dpa reported. 

--- 

2:25 p.m. 

Germany's transport minister says that light commercial vehicles at Volkswagen appear to be affected by the scandal over software used to cheat U.S. emissions test. 

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency accused VW a week ago of installing the so-called ""defeat device"" in 482,000 cars sold in the United States. VW later acknowledged that similar software exists in 11 million diesel vehicles worldwide. The German government has said that those included cars in Europe but it's not yet clear how many. 

German Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said Friday: ""According to our current information, light commercial vehicles as well as cars at Volkswagen are affected by the improper manipulation of diesel engine emissions."" He didn't give details. 

--- 

2:00 p.m. 

Daimler AG, the maker of Mercedes cars, is rejecting claims by a German environmental group that it appears to have been involved in manipulation of emissions data. 

The Deutsche Umwelthilfe group said Friday that it had information that almost all German manufacturers of diesel cars — including Daimler — exceed emissions limits by such a level that it has to assume illegal devices to reduce nitrogen oxide readings are in play. 

Daimler on Friday issued a statement strongly denying any manipulation. It said that so-called defeat devices have never been used by the company, and that goes for all diesel and gas engines. It said that it sticks to all laws and rules, and it isn't aware of any measurements showing that its vehicles fail to keep to legal requirements. 

--- 

1:00 p.m. 

Italy's transport minister says spot-checks will be done on at least 1,000 diesel vehicles of all brands following the Volkswagen emissions-rigging scandal. 

Graziano Delrio said on a late-night talk show that checks will be conducted at dealerships before sale. That will cost 8,000 euros per vehicle, meaning an overall tab of 8 million euros (nearly $9 million). Delrio, citing a ""problem of health, trust,"" said the truth must be established. 

An Italian consumer group, Altroconsumo, said Friday a class action suit was planned and called on Volkswagen to either correct the software employed in the emissions-rigging or substitute the vehicle. 

In Turin, Italy, Prosecutor Armando Spataro said prosecutors there will look into whether a criminal probe is warranted, clarifying earlier reports that investigators had ordered tests on Volkswagens in Italy. 

--- 

12:20 p.m. 

Norwegian authorities have launched an investigation to find out whether the Volkswagen emissions-rigging scandal affects the Nordic country. 

Norway's economic crimes unit said Friday it will investigate whether ""there has been a criminal offense in Norway and whether the fraud has any significance for the cars in question that have been imported to the country."" 

The agency said it was working on the case jointly with the customs and transportation authorities.

Shares in German carmakers are leading a rebound in the country's stock market. 

The DAX index is up 2.6 percent in morning trading, helped by a 4 percent rise in shares in BMW AG. The company had seen a big drop the day before on a report that one of its models exceeded European emissions limits. The report did not allege any cheating by BMW. 

Shares in Volkswagen, which plunged early in the week before stabilizing, were up 1.5 percent as its board meets to find a new CEO and discuss the scandal.",2207637b-15e5-4e8a-9b2d-30c757f7690b,News,2015-09-25T20:00:50Z,Charlotte Observer,The Latest: Switzerland to ban sales of some VW group cars,0.0,News

1457,"Frustrated trainers have taken a swipe at officials about the absence of a group 1 sprint during Sydney's spring carnival before a star-studded cast assembles for The Shorts at Randwick. Frustrated trainers have taken a swipe at officials about the absence of a group 1 sprint during Sydney's spring carnival before a star-studded cast assembles for The Shorts at Randwick. Anointed the world's best sprinter by his trainer Joe Pride, the resuming Terravista heads up a mouth-watering group 2 dash over 1100 metres on Saturday.

But Terravista's cameo in Sydney could be limited to one – maybe two – starts before being whisked to Melbourne for the spring riches on offer down south.

Fellow Warwick Farm trainer Gary Portelli will saddle up Rebel Dane, one of three group 1 winners in The Shorts field, and remains perplexed that he will be forced to head across the border in search of another major.

""I can't understand why we only have two group 1 [open-age sprints] in Sydney [all season],"" Portelli said.

""All these stallions get retired to stud because there aren't that many options after their three-year-old group 1s. There are only a few on as four-year-olds. We breed sprinters – that's all we do – but we don't put races on for them.

""We seem to be putting on all this prizemoney for stayers when there's probably two or three chances in a race, whereas in this race the winner could come from anywhere.""

The state's premier trainer, Chris Waller, who will resume Delectation in The Shorts, said he was ""amazed"" by the absence of a short-course group 1 in Sydney during the spring.

""Look at this race ... it is a group 1-type of field; gee it will be tough to win,"" Waller said.

Rebel Dane ($9) and Delectation ($13) occupy the fifth and sixth lines of betting with Ladbrokes for The Shorts, with Terravista a dominant $2.60 favourite.

Portelli is bullish about his entire's chances after a throat operation and sharp barrier trial, but is mindful he has never run his stable star over anything less than 1200 metres in his career.

""That's why I've kept him fresh and haven't given him two hard trials,"" he said. ""Hopefully he will be warming up late and going quick enough to catch them up in front.

""Physically [the throat operation] has made a huge difference to him. He's a much happier horse and he looks bigger and stronger. He weighs 494 kilos now and that's something he's never weighed going into a race first-up. He's normally around 480 [kilograms]. He's ready to run a big race on the weekend.""

Waller will send Delectation back to the races on the back of a couple of trials after the gelding was a luckless ninth in the Stradbroke Handicap during the winter.

""He will have to be near his top to match it with some of these, but we are happy with him and he usually races well fresh,"" Waller said.

3935,"Hungary PM wants 3-bn euro migrant aid plan 12 September 2015, 04:22 CET — filed under: Europe, migrants, Hungary, aid, migration (BERLIN) - Hungary's prime minister, whose country is under fire for its perceived harsh treatment of migrants, wants Europe to give three billion euros aid to Syria's neighbours to help stem the flow of refugees, it was reported Saturday.
In an interview with German newspaper Bild, Viktor Orban said he wants the European Union to give the money to Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, the first ports of call for Syrians trying to escape conflict.
""We have a plan, which I will present to the heads of the European Union at our next meeting (to provide) massive financial support to countries neighbouring Syria,"" he said, according to excerpts of the interview released by the newspaper.
Millions of people have been displaced by Syria's four-year war, with many given refuge in camps in neighbouring countries.
But an increasing number are now flowing into Europe, where authorities are struggling to cope with the biggest movement of people since World War II.
Orban has taken a hard line against the thousands of migrants passing through Hungary.
Riot police have been deployed to control crowds and footage from inside refugee camps has revealed harsh conditions.
Hungary this week increased the number of soldiers building its controversial anti-migrant border fence, as the numbers of people crossing from Serbia hit a new record.
Orban has stood firm on the implementation of harsh new laws which could see migrants jailed for entering Hungary starting Tuesday.
""If it takes more money, we will increase aid until the refugee flows are drying up,"" Orban told the paper.
""These migrants do not come from war zones but from camps (in these border countries), where they were safe.
""They are not fleeing danger -- they have already fled and should not fear for their lives.
They come to Europe not ""because they seek safety but because they want a better life than in a camp. They want a German life, perhaps a Swedish life"". ""But it's a fact: there is no fundamental right to a better life, only a right to security and human dignity,"" he said. Text and Picture Copyright 2015 AFP. All other Copyright 2015 EUbusiness Ltd.

1567,"On TV, the National Football League is king. On the Internet, not so much. 

As more Americans cut the cable cord, migrating online to get their fix of shows, movies and cat videos, the nation's biggest professional sports league has been experimenting with apps and other digital initiatives, so far with only fair results. 

Now, the NFL's media division in Culver City is moving more aggressively to complement its vast TV empire with an online presence worthy of a major sports league. 

Over the last year, it has replaced mobile app and NFL.com executives, welcomed four engineering and project leaders from the tech industry and increased its outreach to fans and Silicon Valley. An overhauled NFL Mobile app just launched, with a streamlined online subscription package that includes live audio of games and shows such as ""A Football Life"" and ""Hard Knocks."" 

In October, a regular season game will be broadcast for free only on the Internet for the first time. For now, the NFL isn't looking to regularly live-stream games online only - even though the technology and demand are there - because it doesn't want to jeopardize its relationships with major television networks and the billions of dollars it receives a year to show games on TV. Instead, its Internet strategy for the time being is to build online features and portals that will enhance fans' ties to the sport - and pull in some additional revenue. 

League executives know they face stiff competition online. Third-party football apps, Twitter and other sports are all vying for fans' attention, and the near-ubiquity of smartphones makes all of those options available at any time - not just when you're sitting in front of your TV. 

""We know people love the NFL, but at the same time, we know we have to do things differently,"" said Brian Rolapp, who oversees the NFL's media group. ""We have to be more flexible."" 

It's a crucial strategy, given the rapid change in how and where content is viewed. Last month, media company stocks nosedived after Walt Disney Co. lowered profit-growth forecasts for its cable business, led by ESPN, because of a decline in pay-TV subscribers. 

Although analysts say access to live sports is the top reason many people stick with cable - the NFL last year saw its U.S. revenue, mostly from TV network fees, jump 21 percent to $7 billion - they warn that professional sports leagues aren't immune to changing consumer preferences. 

""There's definitely a horizon people are trying to figure out for TV, and that's why most leagues are being aggressive and creative about digital opportunities,"" said Chris Russo, managing director at investment bank Houlihan Lokey and an NFL Media executive from 1999 to 2005. 

Some sports leagues are on their way. 

Major League Baseball's media division, for one, has become so successful that it's reportedly seeking to become its own company at a market value of about $5 billion. MLB Advanced Media not only runs the league's website and apps, but also provides video-streaming technology to HBO, Sony and other heavy hitters. Last month, it agreed to take over digital operations for the National Hockey League. 

The NFL is making strides: Its growth in revenue from online ads, licensing and subscriptions is surpassing every other business segment, including merchandise sales and national sponsorships. But Rolapp said that the industry is shifting at a ""velocity greater than we anticipated,"" which makes pulling off an ambitious digital plan vital. 

The league's latest online projects are led by Perkins Miller, who put the 2008 Olympics on the Web for NBC and launched the World Wrestling Entertainment's online video service. Hired in April 2014 as the NFL's chief digital officer, he quickly set out to identify problems. 

Miller noticed that although NFL Media had bolstered digital operations over the last few years, the department tried to do too much, developing apps such as one to find bars to watch games. The league rushed to react to trends, rather than responding with a bigger strategy in mind. 

Groups didn't collaborate. They released apps with bugs - videos took long to load, for instance - or without organization. In one of its apps, a team's schedule sat in several places. 

""It's easy to build and think we're the NFL and we're big, therefore it will work,"" Miller said. 

He sought to replace complacency with urgency: A fan could drift toward a new sport any moment. The NFL wanted to ensure that football was the first thing people searched for when they opened their phone, launched Google or turned on the TV. 

Within a week, Miller gave social media managers new latitude to chat with fans instead of just inundating them with content. Posts came with more sass, and they sought more feedback on hot topics. Clicks from social media to NFL.com rose. 

In the following months, NFL Media struck major video-related deals for the first time with Facebook Inc., YouTube, Snapchat and Yahoo Inc., relenting on what had been rigid control over video rights. This month, NFL expanded a deal to post more content on Twitter. 

Miller also went straight to fans, commissioning innovation consulting firm Ideo to ask people what they wanted from the NFL. 

""If you aren't waking up every morning making sure that the experience on NFL applications is the best we can imagine, we're not in the long term going to do right by the business,"" Miller said. 

The top request: Seeing short, national football news tidbits before stuff about their favorite teams. The news blurbs had to make them ""pub smart,"" or able to hold their own at the water cooler. They also wanted to watch games live on the go, and this season, all prime-time and some afternoon games will be accessible for free on Verizon Wireless phones. 

Reshaping a 95-year-old league is a team effort. So Miller hired executives who could build on the feedback. 

Todd Berman, the new vice president of technology, brought from Silicon Valley an app development process in which improvements reach fans' screens sooner. He's also open-sourcing, or making freely available, some of the programming for others in tech to use. Longer, secretive development cycles are common at old-line businesses, but not at today's hot companies. 

""Fans spend all day on Facebook and Twitter and if they come to the NFL and it looks, feels and acts different, it's not compelling,"" Berman said. 

Miller then tasked David Jurenka, a former Microsoft Xbox executive, with getting workers ""to think NFL digital media instead of their individual product."" 

A third new vice president, Linda Tong, is using her background in tech start-ups and venture capital to design online features. Last month, Miller added Dan Hogan, vice president of engineering in media services, to sift through decades of video, articles and game data to find new uses for them. 

In response to the survey responses, the new NFL Mobile app opens to a scoreboard on game days. It features stats and key facts before games, access to video highlights during them and video summaries after. On other days, users see news first. New graphics brighten the look. 

The NFL also merged subscriptions services into a new package called GamePass. It includes highlight videos and shows the league had once charged for in the now-scuttled NFL Now app. U.S. subscribers also get live video of preseason games, live radio of regular season games and ""game rewind"" clips. The offering could serve as a test case for consumer tolerance to pay for live online streams of every game someday. 

Russo, the sports-media expert, said turning kids into lifelong fans rests on stronger online options. 

""While not driving the bulk of revenue today,"" he said, ""digital is driving the fandom, the excitement and the TV viewership.""",5904cc20-e8b6-4a10-b93f-0ad8204a96c0,News,2015-09-06T08:00:00Z,Rock Hill Herald,NFL putting its online playbook to the test,0.0,News

2588,"Tom Brady has already stated that he won’t retire until he sucks . In that case, the Patriots’ 38-year-old quarterback seems to have a lot of football ahead of him. 
 
Through his first two weeks in the 2015 season, Brady has completed 69.2 percent of his passes for 754 yards, seven touchdowns, and zero interceptions. New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick credited Brady’s diligence when discussing his continued success during a conference call on Tuesday. 
 
“Tom works really hard,” Belichick told reporters . “He takes great care of himself, and he works really hard physically to be ready to go. I have great respect for the way he competes all over the field in terms of his preparation, physically and as far as knowing our opponent and the game plan and all that. That’s a big part of it.” 
  - Continue Reading Below 
   
Earlier this week, Brady cited his mental preparation and experience as reasons why he’s rarely fooled in pre-snap reads. A February 2015 profile in The New York Times Magazine  chronicled the lengths that Brady physically prepares to play as long as possible, tailoring his diet, sleeping habits, and workout plans. 
 
“He’s a tremendous worker,” Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels said Tuesday when asked about Brady’s battle against Father Time . “He spends the entire year preparing his body and his mind, and I would go so far as to say the emotions and those types of things that we have to put into this job and that he has to put into it as a player. He spends a huge chunk of time getting himself prepared and ready to do the things that he wants to do. 
 
“He has high expectations and high goals for himself. He knows that it’s going to take a tremendous amount of work to continue performing at the level that he wants to play at. I think he deserves a lot of credit for that.”

Washington, Sep 30 (IANS) If you love to drink red wine, take that sip with a little caution as researchers have found that many red wines in the US contain arsenic levels that exceed what is allowed in drinking water. 
 
Arsenic is a naturally occurring element that is toxic to humans in some forms, and can cause skin, lung and bladder cancers, and other diseases. 
 
As rain, rivers or wind erode rocks that contain arsenic, it leaches into water and soil. From there, the toxic metalloid can work its way into the food chain. 
 
However, in a study, the researchers concluded that the likely health risks from arsenic in red wines depend on how many other foods and beverages known to be high in arsenic, such as apple juice, rice, or cereal bars, an individual person eats. 
 
“Unless you are a heavy drinker consuming wine with really high concentrations of arsenic, of which there are only a few, there is little health threat if that is the only source of arsenic in your diet,” said researchers Denise Wilson, professor at University of Washington in Seattle. 
 
“But consumers need to look at their diets as a whole. If you are eating a lot of contaminated rice, organic brown rice syrup, seafood, wine, apple juice — all those heavy contributors to arsenic poisoning — you should be concerned, especially pregnant women, kids and the elderly,” Wilson noted. 
 
The study that tested 65 wines from America’s top four wine-producing US states — California, Washington, New York and Oregon — found all but one have arsenic levels that exceed what is allowed in drinking water. 
 
The US Environmental Protection Agency allows drinking water to contain no more than 10 parts per billion of arsenic. 
 
The wine samples ranged from 10 to 76 parts per billion, with an average of 24 parts per billion. 
 
The study looked at red wines because they are made with the skin of grapes where arsenic that is absorbed from soil tends to concentrate. 
 
The findings appeared in the Journal of Environmental Health.

2311,"A high speed chase through several Florida counties left a Flomaton man dead early Monday morning. Jermey Montrell Elliott, who was 35, was being pursued by several of Alabama’s Escambia County Sheriff’s Office deputies when the wreck occurred near Baker around 12:30 a.m. The chase started in Flomaton, Alabama, entered into Escambia County, Florida, and continued through Santa Rosa County into Okaloosa County. Elliott was driving at speeds of about 100 miles per hour when he entered Okaloosa County, with three Alabama patrol cars in pursuit, according to an Okaloosa County Sheriff’s Office incident report. An Okaloosa deputy saw the chase and had been advised by his supervisor that he was only there to as-sist, but not to pursue, the report said. He followed the flashing lights to 1414 Aaron Baker Road, where he saw the red Dodge Dakota that Elliott had been driving. It had rolled onto the driver’s side and struck a tree. Elliott was trapped in the truck and pronounced dead at the scene. He was not wearing a seatbelt, ac-cording to the Florida Highway Patrol media release. Several firearms were located in the truck, including two loaded pistols, one shotgun and one loaded AR-15 rifle. A brown backpack containing what appeared to be marijuana and about $2,000 were also found, ac-cording to the OCSO incident report. The items were taken into custody by the Escambia County Sheriff’s Office.  ",31f41451-6a7c-454c-a454-9f80b4a38058,News,2015-09-14T16:39:59Z,Northwest Florida Daily News,Flomaton man killed in high speed chase,0.0,News

1878,"FINDING a way to pair items with the needs of individuals set Australian Local Hero Juliette Wright on the path to establish GIVIT. 

IT all began with a fat baby and a husband’s dirty undies.

This is how founder and chief executive of GIVIT Juliette Wright described the inception of the not-for-profit organisation, which is now a lead partner for the Queensland government during state disasters.

“My baby was so fat that my father-in-law – a dairy farmer – kept dropping hints about what he did with his weaners,” Juliette told a chortling crowd at the QRRRWN gala dinner last Friday night.

The Australia’s Local Hero of 2015 recipient and finalist in Cosmopolitan Woman of the Year Award explained it began when her breastfed baby was too big to fit his designer clothes sent from friends and family overseas.

“I received these clothes that were hardly worn and I was about to put them in a clothes bin in Dayboro, but someone had put a severed pigs head in there and I couldn’t put these beautiful clothes in there.”

So she decided to donate them directly to charity.

“I was so grateful for my life, so I decided to give them away.”

The only problem was, no charity wanted them. Even when she explained they weren’t just ordinary baby clothes – they were designer baby clothes.

“I called up a shelter, and they wouldn’t take them, so I asked them what they wanted. They said new undies,” she said.

Another shelter she called said they needed sanitary pads, and another needed a pair of closed in work boots.

It was an eye-opener. The boots were needed as a family was homeless because the father had lost his job and couldn’t afford a pair of work boots that he needed to get a job on road works.

“We seem to think that what charities need is what we want to donate,"" she said.

“These charities don’t have a big shed at the back to house the fridge and shed waiting for our donation.”

With this epiphany, Juliette was determined to help and skimmed from her grocery money, buying new undies, a new pair of boots and sanitary pads. She delivered these to the shelters.

“I felt so good and really connected to the community.”

It also got her thinking. What if she had a website that matched what charities wanted with what people had ready to donate?

“I spent $500 building a website, and it absolutely failed,” Juliette said.

The website was not able to remove items from the list once they were donated.

“Every single person I know said it would fail.”

And Juliet was filled with rage - she was not going to give up, so she spent another $900, drew up a contract to ensure what was donated fell off the list, and had another website developed.

So began GIVIT.

For the next few weeks, Juliette spent the days glued to her computer, watching for donations that would match charity needs.

Then she would get them together. It eventually came to a head.

“My husband asked me if I would have the time to buy him some undies, and I said I couldn’t because I was waiting for donations.”

When she asked him, why, he pointed to the two-week pile of washing – mainly his – pushed in the corner.

“He said, ‘This website is not automatic’.”

That night, he came home with a bottle of wine and an idea. The virtual warehouse was born.

Now the system works where donations are kept at the donor's place until a person with need selects it. That way, there are no more situations as seen in the Black Friday fires, where 40,000 pallets of donated goods are still in storage.

These pallets take up more than 50,000 square metres and cost $8 million to store, and no one has the time to sort through.

As a result of the virtual system, and the fact needs are matched directly with donations, GIVIT now handles national disasters for the Queensland government.

In 2011, when Queensland was hit by devastating floods, GIVIT had 1.8 million hits resulting in 33,500 goods matched in three weeks.

“Charities can go into the virtual warehouse, and the homeless person sitting with them can choose what they need – and it is like buying it because it’s their choice.”

Because people have a sense of control and ownership, they are more likely to look after what has been donated.

“It’s easy how it works. What is essential for one person is completely different for another, so I need to have no judgement.”

Now GIVIT can handle up to eight disasters at one time.

So far, it has raised over $600,000 for the Ravenshoe disaster, and it is still dealing with the aftermath of Cyclone Marcia, where it has made 7500 donations.

Now, Juliette has just launched GIVIT Kids, a safe online platform for children to give new or pre-loved belongings.

“I am doing a drought campaign for the next GIVIT project,” she told her inspired audience.

A conversation with Vulnerable Communion: A Theology of Disability and Hospitality, author Tom Reynolds   Bio:
Tom joined the Emmanuel College (part of the University of Toronto) faculty in 2007. He is committed to an interdisciplinary, practical, and relational vision of theology, and his teaching and research address a range of topics related to constructive theology (particularly the doctrine of God and theological anthropology), theological method, intercultural and interfaith engagements, contextual theologies and globalization, philosophical theology, disability studies, and the thought and influence of Friedrich Schleiermacher. His recent Articles Email: tom.reynolds@utoronto.ca MIN 00:30 Tom on Theodicy – The question of why does God allow suffering and how should we think about suffering. 1:00 How would Tom, as a theologian answer the question, “Why would a sovereign God allow a person to be born disabled and encounter such suffering?” 2:20 The Why questions and the answers are messy, ongoing, and evolving. These answers are limited and open to ongoing revision. 3:00 Reframing needed. Question the question and its suppositions about seeing suffering first and foremost as the issue. 3:40 If we are pitying a disabled person and seeing them how we would interpret suffering, we might be off base. 4:10 Exclusion as suffering. Social suffering is something we can alleviate as the church or community. 4:40 Tom on the central questions of Theodicy. 5:30 What would a good world be? Interdependent and that holds up the preciousness and fragility of life and human experience as valuable. Good things can be fragile things. 6:30 Does God cause suffering and determine it? Maybe it’s (all) unfolding for us in mysterious ways. 7:40 Book of John, chapter 9: The man born blind. Who sinned? (disciples of Jesus thinking of blindness as a curse) So the glory of God can be revealed. (What might that mean that we haven’t understood yet. [Lisa]) The story is less about curing the disabled and more about reveal Jesus’ power and legitimacy as the Messiah. 9:20 NT Wright author of Evil and the Justice of God (on the Problem of Evil) • God as the Incarnation steps into human suffering as a means to assuage it and also, in that, provides us a model for how to encounter it in the world ourselves, practically speaking. The answers to suffering can become “incarnational”, not cerebral and (held) at a distance. 12:00 The why questions signal a (good) unsettledness which can be productive… 12:20 1. God is bigger than our questions and we should feel free to engage in dialogue with God and each other about God. 2. And because it calls us to live into the world and the lives of people will engage who ask, “Where are you?” and we can be there in presence and not (just) with answers. 13:00 “being-with” (The heart of Incarnational living.) 13:30 In many cases God’s own presence is us to each other. 14:00 “Care isn’t so much “doing for” but “being with”.” 15:00 1 in 5 families regularly encounters a serious disability of some kind. 15:30 We (as a family) chose to continue to come to church even though it was sometimes messy so he (and everyone) could figure out how to make it work. (Lisa) 16:00 How can people in Christian Communities or leaders in Christian communities do better when it comes to being truly hospitable  and caring well for people with disabilities. 17:00 Training ministers to come along side is important. 17:30 In his mission and intro to Theology class, what is framed is practical wisdom lived out in relationships of caring regard with other people. (not in the academic halls or in isolation). 18:00 On developing the perception to see/understand differently and to see places where people have been harmed by certain ways of seeing these…like the healing narratives…illness as curses from God, or metaphors of seeing and hearing language and attitudes (able-ism) for example. 18:50 How to show consideration: Asking before you assist someone. Or asking how you can best help and not presuming that you know (or know better). Listen first, then do. 19:30 Ministry doesn’t have to be deficit-focused to the “needy”…but rather possibility focused. As all people of resources and gifts [are] welcome among the community…this turns things upside-down. 20:30 Think of people as sites of wisdom that help a community of belonging. 21:00 1 Cor 12:25 Members having the same care for one another. All can care and contribute. Living out the image of God with shared affinity. 22:00 Transformative and vulnerable communion within our communities…being together. 23:20 [There is] dignity in participation. (Lisa) Allowing people to serve along side means that we are equal. 25:40 Equality isn’t sameness. Difference doesn’t mean a hierarchy. 27:40 (Tom) Music is my therapeutic other life.   A Call for Help!

After allegedly getting shot at a concert earlier this year, a man is suing pop star Chris Brown, TMZ reports.  

Paul Briley, a fan who attended Brown's Jan 11 show at a San Jose nightclub claims the singer failed to provide enough security, which ultimately led to the violence. 
 
According to TMZ, Brown was on stage when shots were fired and five people were injured. 
 
Brown was unharmed. 
 
Briley alleges that because of multiple incidents at Brown concerts, the singer should have had more security that night.  Brown's people, however, aren't having it.  
 
Nicole Perna, who represents Brown, issued this statement to Billboard : ""It is a poor reflection of our society that violence is so prevalent and it is always a tragedy when someone is physically harmed,"" she said. 
 
""However, this is a completely frivolous lawsuit. We expect that the case will be dismissed and in future, to avoid these reoccurring meritless lawsuits directed at Chris Brown."" 
 
Perna said they plan to seek damages from ""all parties and their lawyers."" 
 
In August last year, former hip-hop mogul Suge Knight and two others  were shot at a pre-VMA party hosted by Brown. Brown later tweeted his frustration:  ""It's disappointing that we as a society can't have fun or enjoy ourselves without any altercations sometimes."" 
 
A month later,  a fan was stabbed while Brown was performing at a Drake and Lil Wayne after-party in Hollywood. 
 
Briley's claim comes just over a month after Brown made headlines for being stranded in the Philippines  after he was accused of skipping out on a concert he was paid to perform.

The blurb is interesting and instantly peaks our interest.  The plot is interesting and had great potential. The execution is entertaining but the story left so many questions behind in my mind. So many story lines were hinted at and then never developed which left questions in my mind like it is told that Mili's father is struggling to keep his business and Mili is determined to help her father but nothing is later elaborated on it neither is it mentioned in the story again. Then Mili's friends' angle is also hinted at but then left hanging and so on.

3053,"STANWAY ROVERS marched into the second qualifying round of the FA Cup thanks to a stunning 3-0 victory at home to Needham Market tonight. 
 
Angelo Harrop’s side were three-up at half-time, following an amazingly one-sided first half against their shell-shocked Ryman Premier opponents. 
 
Jake Clowsley slotted them into a ninth-minute lead, after Dan Heath’s goal-kick caused indecision between the Needham centre-halves. 
 
Craig Hughes then fired home from the penalty spot after a clear foul by Needham keeper Shaun Phillips. 
 
And Jordan Palmer steered home a right-wing delivery on the stroke of half-time to cap a dream first half for Stanway . 
 
Needham fielded a strong side that included former Colchester United heroes Kem Izzet and Karl Duguid. 
 
However, Rovers could have been four-up at the break as they also missed a golden chance earlier in the half. 
 
Ben Newson crossed from deep on the right but Jemal Fox headed back across goal and wide of the far post. 
 
Needham’s night went from bad to worse three minutes into the second half. 
 
Phillips was shown a straight red card for an off-the-ball incident and under-18s keeper Tyler Hursey had to replace the crestfallen former U’s youngster. 
 
The writing was on the wall for Needham and although they had spells of possession in the second half, they were unable to penetrate a well-organised Stanway defence. 
 
The Suffolk side were reduced to nine men in the closing stages when substitute Adam Mills was sent off for a foul on Clowsley.

3198,"Dr. Bill Svoboda is no stranger to taking on writing challenges. 

As a pediatric neurologist, Svoboda published a number of books, include the 650-page book titled ""Language, Learning and Behavioral Complications of Childhood Epilepsy."" 

As an avid reader, and former student at Linden Elementary more than 60 years ago, when Svoboda learned that the school was releasing a book about the history of the elementary, he jumped at the opportunity to purchase a copy. 

As it turned out, though, the school was simply adding a small section to its yearbook. 

There was no book. 

Svoboda, and more than 20 others who misunderstood the school's intentions, were disappointed a more thorough version was not being made. So, Svoboda made the decision to take on the challenge himself. 

“People thought that it was going to be a separate book, and more than 20 people contacted the president of the PTA wanting a copy of the book,” he said. “She replied, ‘no, no, no, it’s nothing like that.' So, I contacted her and told her that I wanted to put one together.” 

Collaborating with the PTA, former principal Bob Robinson and David Pinkall, executive director of the Fremont Public School foundation, Svoboda started tackling his latest challenge. 

Three years later, the 55-page booklet ""Linden Legends"" is complete — and it’s causing a buzz. Svoboda has sold 37 copies so far, and not only to people in Nebraska. Linden alumnus from New Jersey, Florida, Mississippi, Oregon, Arizona and Illinois have purchased copies.  

The booklet is broken down into numerous sections highlighting different decades, and students’ memories from the time period. Also highlighted are staff members who played crucial roles in students’ lives during the particular decade. 

Using the Internet, primarily a Linden Alumni Facebook page, Svoboda networked with dozens of people who attended the school throughout the years. It seemed that everybody had a story to tell about their experience at the school, he said. 

As it turns, out, he has a few of his own as well. 

Svoboda recalls his time in Mrs. Whitcomb’s fifth-grade classroom. She encouraged him to take up puppetry, and even to start a school newspaper. One of his clearest memories is participating in airway drills while the United States was involved with World War ll. At the time, the drills made no sense to young Svoboda.  

“We would have to go down these stair cases during the drills,” Svoboda said. “I could never figure out why they were doing this, it’s not like the Japanese were going to be bombing the middle of Nebraska."" 
 
Years later, though, Svoboda said he learned that the Japanese would tie bombs to balloons and send them overseas — one actually reached an area around North Omaha dropping into an empty field. 

“It took me more than 60 years to appreciate the drills, it finally answered the question for me,” he said with a laugh. 

The reception toward ""Linden Legends"" has been astounding, but Svoboda isn’t surprised because he said he knows how vested of an interest people have in the schools’ history and success. 

Ultimately, people enjoy looking back on their days at Linden and remembering all of the good times they had, the bonds they formed and the cherished memories they made. 

“It certainly triggers a lot of great memories for people,” Svoboda said. “I just had one woman order one and she was so excited to get it. She kept saying that she couldn’t wait to get home so that she could turn all those pages full of memories.” 

""Linden Legends"" can be purchased locally for $5, and shipped anywhere in the country for $9.

2922,"Scientific researches led to the creation of a new technology able of reproducing the effects of various drugs by using brainwaves. The results, offered in the form of doses, are available on the www.i-doser.com website. Ecstasy, cocaine, alcohol, opium, LSD, absinthe, name them one after the other, they are all listed under the doses offered by company i-Doser Labs, not counting more obscure drugs. What seems like an elaborate joke is dead serious: audio files simulate the brain activity while on drugs and create effects on the body. All that is necessary is a good pair of headphones, time and money (certain doses are offered free of charge to try).

Impossible? That is not what are saying dozens of users on the official forums and on private websites. The technology, tested in laboratory, nails it most of the time. As described by user smoke a jointRON after his opium dose, ’’during the dose my arms were very very tingly and sweaty and it felt like the blanket was hugging me. At the end i realized that my fists were clenched. I stood up and had no problem walking and that was it’’. Another one, joshkwas, describe his peyote dose : ’’so im layin and listening and my arms and legs are numb. for like 1 minute i sorta felt like a was a picture in a book and the wind kept tring to blow me into the other pages’’. Similar testimonies are found everywhere, and that’s only on the official website.

Contrary to conventional drugs, the website is completely legal and without danger for health. The various doses are only simulations, often on a lesser scale than the real things. Certain users are supposely using doses to counter their dependence.

3025,"Daughter's poor maths scores have prompted me to personally supervise her schoolwork I looked at my daughter's maths paper and I was stumped - not because the Primary 4 paper was challenging, but because she had scored a measly 19 marks out of 50.

Surprise turned to horror, as I started imagining she would end up failing her Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) and be left sweeping floors and picking up bowls at the nearby hawker centre.

I know this is an over-reaction, but scoring 38 per cent in maths is unacceptable for a girl who is in the second-best class in her school and who has not failed any maths exam before. She may not be as strong academically as her elder sister, but she is no slouch either. The dizzying results woke me up from my slumber. No, I am not hibernating, but I have been so busy with work that I have not been focusing on my children's academic needs.

It's easy to blame my second daughter for not studying hard enough or spending too much time playing video games. But I know I have to take partial responsibility for barely putting any effort to guide her along, especially since I am quite good at maths. In the past, my ""Tiger Mum"" wife - who is also a teacher - stayed home to discipline the children and ensure they completed the endless worksheets and assessment books that she prepared for them.

Thanks to the Ministry of Education's flexible work policy that allows teachers who are mothers with young children to take no-pay childcare leave until they turn four, my wife spent almost 10 years at home nursing and nurturing our three girls.

When our youngest child turned four this year, that privilege ended and my wife is now back at work. Our hectic workload means that we have had little time left to teach the children.

I decided to run through the test paper with my second daughter to identify her weaknesses. That was when I realised the problem was much worse than I had imagined.

I knew she used to have difficulty rounding off numbers and decimals, and had helped her with that. I discovered she now has trouble with multiplication, adding fractions with different denominators and converting fractions to decimals.

At this rate, I thought to myself, it will only get worse. How can she stand a chance to complete problem sums when her basics are in the deep end?

I used to be relaxed about her grades, since the PSLE is still some time away. But the discovery of her weak arithmetic fundamentals has sprung me into action.

The first thing I had to think about: Should I take away her smartphone?

She can spend hours lying on the sofa with it, reading fan fiction and playing games which require her to groom Pokemon-looking pets into majestic beings, while her grades are plumbing new lows.

I have this part figured out - I will swop her smartphone with a dumb phone, so that she can remain contactable without spending all her time on mobile cyberspace.

The second thing I'm doing is to go through her schoolwork and figure out the fundamentals she needs to pick up for her level.

I'm still trying to make sense of what she said: Teachers do not go through the textbook, but come up with their own teaching materials instead. Perhaps life was easier when I was in primary school, because understanding everything in the textbook was good enough for me to score As then. From what I remember, maths requires plenty of practice and perhaps that is what is missing.

I hate to say this, but it looks like I will have to search for suitable assessment books to ""drill"" her into solving the various permutations of maths problems that may crop up in the exams.

And last but certainly not least, I will have to set aside an hour every day to assign her work and check on her answers. To help me do so better, I'm thinking of investing in a Web camera that lets me monitor my home on my smartphone and comes with two-way audio communications, so that I can bark into the microphone if I see her lounging around instead of completing her assignments.

I can do all this, or I can simply just hire a tuition teacher for her. The latter sounds enticing since I do not have to do anything else except write a cheque every month and monitor my spending.

But that would be a cop-out, wouldn't it? And one day when I am old, my child will also hire a foreign domestic worker to take care of me, instead of doing it herself.

Like many things in my life, I will choose the harder path. Not because I am a masochist, but simply because it is the right thing to do.

The tuition teacher might

do his best for the child, but only the parent will be relentless until the child is able to pass her next maths exam.",3b574be3-a63b-4774-b61f-14265147a849,News,2015-09-13T21:00:00Z,Straits Times,"Parenting not as simple as 1, 2, 3",0.0,Blog
1,"New Product Gives Marketers Access to Real Keywords, Conversions and Results Along With 13 Months of Historical Data 

SAN FRANCISCO, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 09/17/15 -- Jumpshot, a marketing analytics company that uses distinctive data sources to paint a complete picture of the online customer journey, today announced the launch of Jumpshot Elite, giving marketers insight into what their customers are doing the 99% of the time they're not on your site. For years, marketers have been unable to see what organic and paid search terms users were entering, much less tie those searches to purchases. Jumpshot not only injects that user search visibility back into the market, but also makes it possible to tie those keywords to conversions -- for any web site. 

""Ever since search engines encrypted search results, marketers have been in the dark about keywords, impacting not only the insight into their own search investments, but also their ability to unearth high converting keywords for their competitors,"" said Deren Baker, CEO of Jumpshot. ""Our platform eliminates the hacks, assumptions, and guesswork that marketers are doing now and provides real data: actual searches tied to actual conversions conducted by real people with nothing inferred."" 

Unlike other keyword research tools that receive data through the Adwords API or send bots to cobble together various data inputs and implied metrics, Jumpshot leverages its panel of over 115 million global consumers to analyze real search activity. As a result, Jumpshot is able to provide companies with actionable data to improve the ROI of their search marketing campaigns, SEO tactics and content marketing initiatives. 

Available today, Jumpshot Elite provides 13 months of backward-looking data as well as: 

Access to real queries used by searchers 

Paid and organic results for any website 

Visibility into organic keywords, eliminating the ""not provided"" outcome in web analytics 

Real user queries, clicks and transactions instead of machine-generated clicks with inferred results 

Ability to tie keywords to real transactions on any website 

Variable attribution models and lookback windows 

Launched in January, 2015, Jumpshot grew out of the ambitions of a group of smart marketers and data scientists who were frustrated about the limitations of the data they had access to, and excited about the opportunity to provide new insights into online behavior. 

The company uses distinctive data sources to paint a complete picture of the online world for businesses, from where customers spend time online to what they do there and how they get from place to place. By tracking the online customer journey down to each click, Jumpshot reveals how and why customers arrive at purchase decisions. The company tracks more data in more detail than other services, tracking 160 billion monthly clicks generated by its extensive data panel. 

About Jumpshot 

Jumpshot is a marketing analytics platform that reveals the entire customer journey -- from the key sources of traffic to a site, to browsing and buying behavior on any domain. With a panel of 115 million users, Jumpshot provides marketers with the insight to understand what their customers are doing the 99% of the time they're not on their own site -- a scope of information never before attainable. Jumpshot was founded in 2015 and is headquartered in San Francisco.

216,"Members at Grove Baptist Church voted to oust Rev. Tim Mattox Sunday Last Friday Rev. Mattox bannished Genora Hamm Biggs, a member of 92 years, for saying she wasn't happy with his services  Rev. Mattox was sent a letter asking him to collect his things He then took out a restraining againt Biggs' grandson and another member   Hamm Biggs used to be a church officer, and her father was a founder  
Members of a northeast Georgia church have voted to fire a pastor who controversially banned a 103-year-old from the congregation after she disagreed with his services. 

The votes were cast Sunday against Reverend Tim Mattox, who have since issues him a 'Letter of Termination' asking him to remove his belongings from the Union Grove Baptist Church of Elberton. 

Rev. Mattox hit headlines last Friday after it was revealed he had banished Genora Hamm Biggs - a church member of 92 years - for displaying conduct that was 'detrimental' to others after she spoke out about his practices, including laying hands on members. 

According to The Atlanta Journal‑Constitution , Rev. Mattox has now taken a restraining order out against the grandson of Hamm Biggs, as well as a former church secretary.  

    
   
Genora Hamm Biggs, known as the 'mother of the church', has been going to Union Grove Baptist Church in Elberton since she joined it 92 years ago, but was banished last week for disagreeing with the pastor 

The outspoken Hamm Biggs, a retired teacher, said at the weekend that the practices used by Rev. Mattox were not Baptist. 

'He is a holy sanctified minister or so he says. We voted him in and we didn't know it until he was there. We are Baptists and that's what we want to stay,' Biggs said. 

A statement from the Union Grove church to the Athens Banner-Herald said fellow members decided to expel Hamm Biggs. 

'It was determined by the congregation during a church conference meeting, which Mrs. Biggs was present at the time of the meeting, that the behavior of Mrs. Biggs and others was detrimental to the church at large and could no longer be allowed,' according to the statement. 

Church members voted in August to revoke Hamm Biggs' membership, although she has continued attending services. 
 
Hamm Biggs was previously a church officer, and her father was one of its founders. She received a letter about her expulsion. 

'I was unhappy and shocked,' said Biggs. 'I joined the church when I was 11 years old.' 

Also banned from the church was Hamm Biggs' grandson, Eliott Dye, a member for 30 years, and Kevin Hamm, an ordained minister who was also a member of the church. 

Hamm said: 'I tried to talk with [Mattox] and he was just determined to say, 'You can't come over here, period.' 

Hamm Biggs said despite the ban, she still considers herself a member of the congregation. She attended the Sunday service last weekend.  
   
Hamm Biggs was left heartbroken after she received a letter in the mail from church members who banned her from stepping foot inside the church 
 
Hamm Biggs explained: 'He told police he wanted to put us out, but the police told him 'you can't do that' 

Hamm Biggs said the entire debacle unfolded after she told the Reverend Mattox she did not agree with his preaching style.  

But her complaints did not sit well with him. 

Soon after she voiced her opinion, the letter arrived. In the letter, sent by certified mail, Hamm Biggs learnt that her church-going privileges were being 'revoked.'  

It stated: 'Dear Mrs. Genora Hamm Biggs, This letter is to inform you that according to the by-laws of the Union Grove Baptist Church, and by vote of the active members, any membership or associations that you have had with this church are now officially revoked.  

'Therefore, you cannot attend Union Grove Baptist Church for any reason whatsoever. You are not to come to the property of the Union Grove Baptist Church located at 680 Pulliam Street, Elberton, Georgia 30635.  

Sincerely, The members and officers of the Union Grove Baptist Church.'  


The devout Christian was a former city clerk and a school teacher who taught first grade for 40 years.  

She says she prays daily but is having her faith tested  after she received the letter.  

And it got worse when she defied the church's orders and went back to worship. She said she was met by the frosty priest who wanted police to escort her out.  

Hamm Biggs said: 'The letter said we're not to come back, but we went back – police were there.'  

She told Fox Carolina : 'He told police he wanted to put us out, but the police told him 'you can't do that.' 

After that,  the pastor dismissed the service. The lights were turned off and Hamm Biggs was left sitting on the pew of a darkened sanctuary. 

'I was shocked. It was not a good feeling. I haven't seen anything like this before,' she said shaking her head. 
   
In the letter, sent by certified mail, it was signed by members and officers of the Union Grove Baptist Church' 
   
Hamm Biggs' name is etched on the side of the church, but she's been scarred by the entire bad experience 

Elberton police officers say it is a civil matter and have not made any arrests.  

Hamm  Biggs' grandson, Eliott Dye and Kevin Hamm say they are upset over the way Hamm Biggs was treated. 

Hamm told Online Athens : 'To disrespect a pillar and a mother of the church; how can we sit back and watch something like this go forward?' 

Her grandson describes his granny as 'outspoken'. He recalls an incident when  a  woman in the church called his grandmother 'Jezebel,' but she didn't hear what she'd said. 

He said: 'I never told her because her feelings would have been hurt. They have been so rude and I don't understand why it's been directed at my grandmother...[But] my grandmother can be pretty outspoken and that could have a lot to do with it.' 

The embattled centenarian, has, however, received the backing of quite a few of the church's 150 parishioners. 

Ezell Land, who used to be a deacon at the church, said the Hamm Biggs' family literally founded the church. He said quite simply: 'It's not right!' 

'They brought it here on a mule and a wagon from the country when I was a little boy,' Land said.  

Land also attended the church for 56 years before he decided to leave after a run-in with the pastor over his singing. 

'Every time I would get up, the pastor would get up and make remarks when I sang and stuff. So, I just got my hat and I left,' he said.

Hamm Biggs' name is etched on the side of the church, but she says she's been scarred by the entire experience.  

She never expected to be thrown out of a church she loved. 

'I wanna get my church straight like it has been,' she said sadly.  

Hamm Biggs is receiving widespread support from people on social media. Many have taken to the church's Facebook page to voice their disgust at the church's actions. 

Shataphy Baugns wrote: 'This is a disgrace to all the children of God....The devil is what you serve @ this church bless the elder lady soul. I pray God keep her covered and give her strength from the hurt she felt with this ridiculous decision made by this pastor.' 

Scott Allen wrote: 'I have never heard of such an act in all my life. It's bad enough that non believer are attacking us believers, but to hear of this kind of action is shame.  

'Those who signed that mean letter should apologize and allow Miss Hamm Biggs back into the church. Make things right again. This is not your house, it is God's House.'",2e74cca6-409c-415b-9001-df66558318dd,News,2015-09-25T06:09:59Z,Mail Online UK,Baptist church members vote to FIRE pastor who kicked out a 103-year-old member after she disagreed with his services,0.0,News

Investigators say Jarod Julies, Douglas Burns, Alex Fagan and Lauren Howard were taken into custody after a month long investigation that spanned from Cumberland County to Knox County. 
 
Several police departments, including the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, recovered several thousand dollars of stolen property. 
 
The investigastion began on August 8, 2015 when several reports of auto burglaries came from the Deer Creek Subdivision. Items stolen included cash, wallets, blue flight suit, handguns and rifles. 
 
On September 6, 2015 more reports came into the Crossville Police Department of auto burglaries in the Deer Creek Subdivision. Investigators observed several videos and found the suspects drove a silver or grey Ford Taurus. 
 
On September 10th a vechicle matching that description was pulled over and the driver was Jarod Julies who was on probation in Knox County for an auto burglary. The car was searched and officers discovered a large sum of cash, marijuana, ski mask, gloves and other reported stolen items. 
 
A search warrant was then executed at an apartment in Ashton Place where more items were recovered. An additional search warrant was issued and the Knox County Swat team and TBI recovered a reported stolen AR 15. 
 
Julies, 24 was charged with theft over $10,000, burglary, vandalism. Burns, Fagan and Howard were all charged with theft of property.

4329,"With conservative assaults on Planned Parenthood funding threatening to cause another government shutdown in the coming months, it’s easy to lose track of less flashy programs that are set to be slashed even if lawmakers compromise to avoid another lights-out moment in federal offices. 
 
One program that stands to lose ground is the nation’s primary official means of fostering volunteer work with public resources. The Corporation for National and Community Service, which funds AmeriCorps programs and volunteers among other service work, is facing drastic cuts in both the House ( 34 percent ) and Senate ( 20 percent ) budget packages. 
 
Such cuts would yank vital support from beneath some of the country’s most vulnerable people, Ashley Bembry-Kaintuck told a crowd Wednesday at the Center for American Progress. She recounted her experience with a fifth-grader named Renija in a Washington, D.C. elementary school, during her time volunteering with City Year. 
 
“She was such a smart little girl but had a lot of behavior problems” that disrupted the whole class. Through close personal attention and open communication about the child’s frustrations, Bembry-Kaintuck said, “we built trust one day at a time. After a few months with Renija, I saw her behavior change dramatically. If she had a problem she would come to me and explain why she was upset.” Eventually all it took was a glance between the two of them, and Renija would refocus on her work instead of blowing up. Her grades improved along with her behavior. 
 
It’s a radically different outcome than is often the case for troubled young people of color in primary and secondary schools in America, where administrators are so quick to discipline that experts have described a “ school-to-prison pipeline ” developing in American public education. The possibility of drastic reductions to the already-meager stipends that make experiences like Renija’s possible frighten Bembry-Kaintuck. “They mean less AmeriCorps members in our schools and communities, less support for fifth graders like Renija, less high school students who are college and career ready,” she said. 
 
The program has already been savaged by cuts in recent years, losing about a seventh of its funding from 2010 to 2013 before the 2014 deal restored less than half of what’d been cut during the height of Tea Party budget fervor. Cutting CNCS is especially obtuse given both the size of the program – barely a billion dollars out of a budget measured in trillions – and the way community service programs return benefits to both the served and the servant. 
 
“It means less young people that have the opportunity to serve and find their career path like I did,” Bembry-Kaintuck, who now uses many of the personal skills she developed in City Year in her video production career, said of the possible cuts. 
 
That positive feedback loop in service work means that programs like City Year have what business-oriented folks like to call a “double bottom-line.” One such person is Jonathan Levine, a Bain Capital veteran who’s passionate about the value of the work CNCS funds – and frustrated at how hard it already is to provide the support these programs need. 
 
“It is actually harder in the United States of America to get a slot in AmeriCorps and do national service than it is to get into many if not most competitive colleges in this country,” Levine said Wednesday at CAP, on whose board of directors he serves. “We do not have a problem of apathy in this country. We have a problem of access.” 
 
City Year’s slogan is simple: “Give a year, change the world.” But few people can afford to just give away a year of their life to a cause, no matter how deeply they believe in it. The cuts currently pending in Congress “would significantly reduce the number of positions AmeriCorps could fund and threaten the modest educational stipend that AmeriCorps workers receive after completing a year of public service work,” the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities notes. 
 
Service program funding has been a pawn in budget games before, as House Republicans have proposed to eliminate it entirely in recent years and the program survived a last-minute budget deal in 2014. All this comes despite broad bipartisan support for the concept of the CNCS, Levine said, pointing out that politicians from both parties showed up when the cameras were rolling for the signing of legislation to create the public corporation. 
 
That reversal is evidence of more than just the standard elected official’s hypocrisy between public words and legislative acts, former AmeriCorps director John Gompertz said Wednesday. It’s an act of self-sabotage for a country where half of all public schoolchildren now live in poverty, and where non-profit service work of many other kinds is caught between high community demand and low resources to meet it. 
 
“The stories Ashley told, that’s exactly what needs to happen for tons and tons of kids,” Gompertz said, because many of them “have not only a money poverty but a relationship poverty. It’s not the absence of love, but the absence of people around them who can help navigate toward a brighter future.”

278,"Mountain bikers who thought they had missed their chance to ride South Africa’s most beautiful race, the Liberty Cape Winelands MTB Encounter, have another chance to enter thanks to an added investment from the title sponsor. 
 
Co-organiser Wynand de Villiers of ASG Events confirmed that Liberty had increased its commitment for the second edition of the three-stage race, which takes place from April 15 to 17 next year. 
 
The 180km event showcases the finest Western Cape mountain biking terrain as it traverses the beautiful Boland mountains, valleys and vineyards between the historic towns of Stellenbosch, Franschhoek, Paarl and Wellington. 
 
According to De Villiers, the enlarged sponsorship had enabled organisers to expand the hosting capacity of each of the registration and race venues, which include the Lanzerac Hotel, Le Franschhoek Hotel and Kleinevalleij Estate. 
 
“We can now comfortably accommodate 300 teams at the event, which means we are re-opening our entry portal and making a further hundred team entries available.” 
 
He said entries would close once the additional slots had been filled. 
 
His fellow organiser, Johan Kriegler of MTB Adventures, added that his route building teams were already hard at work perfecting the trails ahead of the event. 
 
“In the Boland, we’ve got the mountains, awesome fynbos and fauna, great trails and stunning venues that all complement one another. 
 
“It’s a perfect fit and not something you’re going to find anywhere else in South Africa.” 
 
Kriegler, who is also the founder of some of the most popular multistage mountain biking events in the country, said the secret of a great race was to strive for an unequalled mix of trails, view and venues. 
 
“Life is all about doing everything in balance. Most riders want a great time on the bike, exploring nature, having a good workout and still getting back to the race village by lunchtime to swap war stories.” 
 
He said the daily stages would be a manageable 55km to 70km, with climbs not exceeding 1 500m. 
 
“We’re cutting out all the unnecessary climbs and building contour trails to create spectacular vistas with maximum impact. 
 
“You want to build a trail where the scenery surprises you. Where a tunnel through dense vegetation suddenly opens up, or a winding trail turns another corner, and delivers a breath-taking view.” 
 
While some of the trails would be open to the public, Kriegler said the key linking sections would be exclusively used by the race.

A county clerk in the US state Kentucky refuses to issue a marriage licence to same-sex couples on religious grounds. 
 PT1M2S   620  349    
Ashland: A county clerk in Kentucky was held in contempt of court and jailed on Thursday for failing to issue marriage licences to gay couples in defiance of the US Supreme Court. 

But five of Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis' six deputies later told the judge in a second hearing that they were willing to issue the licences. 

It remained to be seen whether US District Judge David Bunning, at a third hearing later on Thursday, would grant a request by Ms Davis' lawyers to release her.

That hearing was scheduled for Thursday afternoon (US time) to determine Ms Davis' fate. Judge Bunning earlier said he was not inclined to release her on Thursday. 
 
 
 
Ms Davis, who broke down crying, was led away by US Marshals after the first hearing. 

The 49-year-old woman, who has emerged as a darling of social conservatives, has refused to issue licences to any couples, gay or straight, since the US Supreme Court in June ruled that same-sex couples have the right to marry under the US Constitution, citing her beliefs as an Apostolic Christian.

Thursday's proceedings were the culmination of months of legal wrangling and refusals to abide a judge's order to do her job that had drawn national attention from those both for and against gay marriage rights. 

""Marriage is a union between one man and one woman,"" she told the court under questioning by her attorney.

1803,"Ella Collins, winner of Miss Fa’afafine Australia 2015, Sydney PHOTO: THE first-ever Australian contestant to compete in a unique global third gender beauty pageant has claimed second place at the contest. 
 
Ella Collins, from Merrylands in western Sydney, nabbed the runner-up position earlier this month at the annual Miss Fa’afafine international competition, held in the Samoan capital Apia. 
 
Fa’afafine, which in Samoan means “in the manner of women”, are biologically male but commonly express female identities and are generally considered to be a distinct non-binary gender. 
 
In a Facebook post after the event, which attracts contestants from across the Pacific, Collins said it was the “best experience” she had ever had: 
 
Collins, who has a background in dance, won a place at the finals after taking out the crown last month at the inaugural Miss Fa’afafine Australia contest held in south western Sydney. 
 
The pageant included traditional rounds such as swimwear and eveningwear but also featured elements like a round focused on traditional Samoan dancing. The competition is also known for the flamboyance and creativity of its costumes. 
 
Collins took many of the routines she premiered in Sydney, including a high energy and tongue-in-cheek performance mixing Beyoncé and a traditional war dance, to Samoa. 
 
In Sydney, Collins wowed the judges when she said that she hoped her success would be a positive example to young trans* people. 
 
“I’m just all about saving lives and knowing there is a high suicide rate among transgenders I want to be an advocate to stop that and bring awareness to help those kids,” she told the Star Observer at the time. 
 
The overall crown was taken out by New Zealand’s entry, Steve Auina, who had previously won the Miss Auckland Fa’afafine completion.

2158,"Ciara sat down with CBS This Morning on Wednesday. Naturally the conversation turned to her relationship with Seattle Seahawks QB Russell Wilson. 
 

 
Ciara has been catching heat from her ex-fiance, rapper Future, and fans because of her decision to allow Wilson around she and Future’s one-year old son. 
 

 
Many felt it was too early in her relationship to have Baby Future around Russell. Ciara says that this is a double standard. She pointed out that Future has four children and she was around them early into their relationship. She also says she attempted to set up a meeting between Future and Russell but Future declined. 
 
Ciara also goes on to discuss she and Russell’s decision to practice celibacy. Cici says it’s difficult, but great sex would just be the cherry on top of their relationship.

1693,"NBC have given a green light for a ‘Brides Of Dracula’ pilot with a view to it going to full series. The drama is to be produced and written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa & Greg Berlanti. The concept behind the series asks what if Dracula’s Brides had survived for centuries after the slaying of their Vampire master and now reside in New York city. Written by Aguirre-Sacasa, Brides is described as a sexy reimagining of Dracula as a family drama with a trio of strong, diverse female leads, a show about empowered women and the things they do to maintain wealth, prestige, legacy — and their non-traditional family. The project hails from Warner Bros. Television and studio-based Berlanti Prods., with Aguirre-Sacasa, Berlanti and Berlanti Prods.’ Sarah Schechter executive producing. Known in popular culture as the Brides of Dracula, the three characters, originally introduced in Bram Stoker’s classic novel, are portrayed as beautiful and powerful female vampire “sisters” who reside with Count Dracula in his castle in Transylvania where they use their charm to seduce and bewitch men before preying on them. In the book the brides managed to seduce Van Helsing who just about manages to shake off their spell and kills them. The brides have been a strong staple in the ‘Dracula’ mythology since the very start and have appeared in numerous movies before headlining in the 1960s in the film ‘Brides Of Dracula’.  ",7db85611-9b19-43df-bd28-75b64a9f5327,Blog,2015-09-03T09:30:26Z,SciFi Pulse,‘Brides of Dracula’ Series Lands At NBC,1.0,Blog

4005,"Top-ranking foreign and domestic mountain bikers will test their endurance and skill in one of the world's toughest terrains when the MTB Himalaya gets rolling from here on the off-road tracks of Himachal Pradesh on September 27.This year's edition - the 11th - will see the highest number of foreign participants so far. The highest number of riders are from Portugal, Spain and Germany, apart from India.The event will conclude at the starting point on October 4 after traversing 550 km.""We have got confirmation from more than 40 bikers. They are from 10 countries. This will be the maximum participation of foreign cyclists,"" Mohit Sood, president of the Himalayan Adventure Sports and Tourism Promotion Association (HASTPA), the Shimla-based organiser, told IANS. 

World No.9 Luis Leao Pinto from Portugal, ABSA Cape Epic winner Catherine Williamson from Britain, nine-time German champion Reimund Dietzen, Andreas Hartman and Manuel Wesseinbacher (both from Austria), and Sonia Lopes, the first woman cyclist to conquer the non-stop 500 km Portugal Bike Race, are among the internationally-acclaimed riders, besides over 50 Indian cyclists.Titan desert MTB Marathon champion Pinto was the MTB Himalaya champion in 2013 in the men's category, while Lopes, the mother of a four-year-old boy, won the MTB Himalaya women's category last year.After winning the title, Pinto had told IANS that he had conquered ranges from 2,000 metres to 2,300 metres in Europe, but the mighty hills of Himachal Pradesh will be challenging for him.For Lopes, coming to India was well within the budget. ""It's quite expensive while cycling in Europe,"" she said. 

Pau Zamora, Antonio Ortiz, Ibon Zugasti and Sarah Pasco, all from Spain, Nepal national champion Ajay Pandit Chettri, Magnolia Bike Challenge champion Balboni Vanni, Andi Shewald from Germany and British National Road Champion Sharon Laws will also vie for the title in the open men solo, open women solo categories.Canadian national biking champion Cory Wallace, who won the MTB Himalaya last year, said the rally was more professionally managed.""I have travelled more than 40 countries for MTB. Here the organisers are more professional.

But now I am looking forward to Himalaya,"" the 56-year-old biker added. 

British rider Catherine Williamson said: ""The reason I am racing Hero MTB Himalaya is because it's a part of the world I have never visited and know very little about and I'm hoping to inspire other girls to ride and travel as much as possible.""""I am looking forward to meeting equally crazy and adventurous riders and expect the challenge to be against the environment and terrain which is what appeals the most,"" she added.Forty-seven-year-old Italian and winner of Iron Bike 2008 Vanni is participating in the MTB Himalaya because he likes difficult challenges.""Dominating the Himalayas will be my ultimate achievement,"" he added.Event organiser Sood said the participants would pass through forest trails, off-road, broken tarmac, gravel, rocks, mud, sand, loose rock and unmetalled rural roads.On an average, each cyclist will pedal 80-90 km every day with one day of rest in between and will have to ascend 2,000-2,500 metres each day. The highest point of the rally is 3,150 metres or 10,500 feet.Sood said the most exciting route is the 18-km long mule track from the picturesque village of Kullu Sarahan, about 170 km from the state capital, at the base of the 3,277-metre Bashleo Pass, to Tarala.The entire route passes through a mountain ridge.",4fddc3a1-5425-486f-b62a-2f59af03fd53,News,2015-09-08T11:14:20Z,5 Dariya News - English,International bikers all set to tackle Himachal's off-road tracks,0.0,News

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his government are pushing security bills through parliament that could send Japanese troops into conflict for the first time since World War Two, sparking massive protests around the country.Many with memories of the war and its aftermath are scathing about Abe’s steps away from Japan’s pacifist constitution in pursuit of a more robust security stance, and survivors of the bombing lambasted Abe at a meeting after the commemoration ceremony.

Partnership Will Allow Viewers to Experience Original 360-Degree Content as well as Upload User Generated 360-Degree, Virtual Reality Content

PITTSBURGH 

DEFY plans to debut the platform on Break.com in early October in conjunction with 360fly's retail launch at Best Buy. The company will also look to launch the 360fly platform across other DEFY brand channels in the coming year, as well as leveraging 360fly digital products for its original studio production and programming. 

360fly's interactive 360-degree video player technology provides viewers a 360 x 240-degree field of view. Viewers can literally immerse themselves within the video through touch-screen technology, clicking, dragging or swiping on any mobile device, as well as through motion-sensor technology by which the movement of the device itself controls the interactive experience of the video. With desktops and laptops, this interactivity is achieved through the use of the mouse, clicking and dragging the video to see and experience different vantage points within the larger 360 x 240-degree field of view. ""The introduction of interactive 360-degree video is truly a game-changer, opening the door to an entirely new universe of innovative interactive and virtual reality content experiences for our viewers and internal content creators,"" said Keith Richman 

The collaboration is a valuable one for 360fly as it pushes forward in its mission to drive widespread mainstream acceptance, production and consumption of interactive 360-degree video, while also democratizing virtual reality through a platform that's dramatically more accessible and feasible for mainstream consumers. To date, consumption of virtual reality has been a very costly proposition, requiring the use of much higher-priced equipment and limited to a small array of virtual reality content. In combination with affordable cardboard virtual reality goggles, 360fly is opening the door for consumers to produce, consume and share virtual reality experiences at a moment's notice. 

""Affordable cameras and viewing devices are only part of the equation. The final piece is consumers having access to a robust ecosystem of destinations where they can readily consume a wide range of 360-degree virtual reality content,"" said Peter Adderton

469,"Pittsburgh's mayor wants to make sure holiday window relics, an icing bag that was used to make thumbprint cookies, and other artifacts from the downtown Macy's store live on after it closes later this month. 
 
Mayor Bill Peduto wrote a letter to the department store chain last week saying he wants all artifacts of historic value to be preserved, maintained and made available for public view, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported . 
     
Peduto's chief of staff, Kevin Acklin, said the mayor stepped in after the city was notified that Macy's and its contractor were attempting to sell off some historical items from the landmark building, where the now-defunct Kaufmann's chain ran its flagship store for more than a century. 
     
But Macy's spokeswoman Elina Kazan said it was always the chain's intent to preserve the building's artifacts. Macy's has its own archivist sorting through the material and is working to safeguard the items, she said. 
     
""We knew the store housed a lot of history in it and it is an ongoing process,"" Kazan said. ""We respect the legacy of Kaufmann's and what the downtown building signifies. We are exploring every avenue to allow Pittsburghers to still experience and enjoy it."" 
     
Among the items the city is trying to preserve are Tic Toc and other Kaufmann's restaurant menus, an exterior brass store plaque, a salon chair and employee name tags. 
     
The building was acquired a decade ago by Macy's, which sold it to Core Realty for $15 million because it was only using a third of the space. The Philadelphia developer plans to convert it to apartments, a hotel and retail space. 
     
Randy Mineo, Core's executive vice president of leasing, said the firm is interested in setting aside a place in the building to display Kaufmann's and Macy's artifacts.",fe028334-2fdc-475a-9072-0f97b431888c,News,2015-09-16T15:51:39Z,WTAE.com,Mayor: Save items from old Kaufmann's building before Macy's closes,0.0,News

These beauties are layered with roasted peaches, homemade streusel and an Almond Breeze Almondmilk Vanilla/Greek Yogurt mixture that will make your heart sing! Everything combined together is sweet, tangy, fruity and ah-mazing. It’s the perfect refreshing bite to keep on hand for the rest of summer. Which, as we talked about before, I plan on extending through October And here’s the key to bringing them to a picnic – DESSERT FIRST! And a giant tub of ice to keep them frozen until it’s time to chow down!    
In case you don’t own 2394723984 billion ice pop molds and craft sticks like me, here are my favorites:

Peaches ’n Cream Pops
Ingredients1 pound peaches, pits removed and sliced into chunks1 teaspoon lemon juice1/2 cup honey, divided1 ½ cups Almond Breeze Almondmilk Vanilla1/2 cup full fat Greek yogurt1 teaspoon pure vanilla extractsmall pinch fine sea salt
For the streusel1/2 cup flour2 ounces cold butter1/4 cup brown sugar1 teaspoon cinnamon
InstructionsPreheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Arrange the peaches in an even layer on a parchment-lined sheet pan. Drizzle with lemon juice. Roast until the peaches are soft and fragrant, about 20 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes on the pan, then transfer to a bowl (including juices) and let cool to room-temperature.Make the streusel while the peaches are cooling. In a food processor, combine the flour, butter, sugar and cinnamon and pulse for a few seconds to break up the butter. Place the mixture on a parchment lined baking sheet and pat the mixture into a large cookie shape and bake for 10 minutes. Remove the streusel from the oven and let cool. Once cooled, break apart into crumbles.Add the roasted peaches and 1/4 cup honey to a food processor, and pulse once or twice to combine. The mixture should still be a be quite chunky.In a separate bowl, whisk together the Almond Breeze Almondmilk Vanilla and the remaining 1/4 cup honey. Taste and adjust honey if you want it to be sweeter. Stir in the vanilla and salt until smooth.Spoon a tablespoon of the peach mixture into the bottom of each ice pop mold. Layer with a bit of the cream and another layer of the streusel. Continue layering until all the molds are evenly filled. Freeze until set, about 4-5 hours. After 30 minutes of freezing time, place a wooden craft stick in each pop, and continue freezing.To remove the pops: Place the popsicle mold in a large pot of warm water for 10-15 seconds, then pull gently on each pop stick until the pops release.

2629,"Treasurer Joe Hockey, pictured with Tax Commissioner Chris Jordan on Wednesday, announce their crackdown on multinationals suspected of tax avoidance. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen  
  
Treasurer Joe Hockey's crackdown on 1000 large companies accused of not paying enough tax in Australia is ""bad tax law' and will result in revenue wars with other nations, experts have warned. 

On Wednesday Mr Hockey introduced new legislation to Parliament that boosts anti-avoidance laws and could see companies with annual global revenue of $1 billion or more hit with double tax, plus interest, if they are found to be illegally shifting profits offshore. 

The laws, which apply from January, were initially expected to apply to 30 companies with with annual global revenue of $1 billion or more, but will now affect 1000 companies. This is because the $1 billion figure applies to global revenue, and a company's local subsidiary, could have a revenue figure below that amount. 

Mr Hockey has refused to put an exact figure on the tax revenue expected to be recouped.  
 
Tax Commissioner Chris Jordan, who joined Mr Hockey at a press conference on Wednesday where they announced the new laws, said he hoped that multinationals would come forward and co-operate with the Australian Taxation Office, before the January start date. 

The government could collect hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue, simply by using the new legislation as a threat, and encouraging companies to restructure and pay more tax ahead of the laws. 

But tax experts are warning that the laws could deter business investment and spark revenue wars with overseas tax authorities. 

""This is a dangerous strategy for Australia to pursue,"" Tax Institute President Stephen Healey said. 

""The bill that has been introduced to Parliament today [on Wednesday] includes provisions in relation to country-by-country reporting that have been hastily drafted, with inadequate consultation, before global efforts directly relevant to these matters are finalised. 

""The result is further uncertainty, complexity and, if passed, potentially bad tax law."" 

Already, one of the US Treasury's top officials, has labelled the Australian measures as evidence the debate is heading ""in a disturbing direction"" . 

US deputy assistant secretary for international tax affairs at US Treasury, Robert Stack, has singled out Australia and Britain for unilaterally moving ahead of other countries, and criticised both governments for putting politics ahead of good policy. 

CPA Australia chief executive Alex Malley also expressed concerns with the legislation, saying it had gone beyond capturing only the so-called Dirty Thirty, 

""Treasurer Hockey is now expanding the net to 1000 companies, which is potentially a lot of uncertainty, which will need detailed and considered explanation to ensure compliance,"" he said. 

Mr Malley said Australia needed to work within the OECD and the G20 crackdown against multinational tax avoidance, known as Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. 

""This is important to ensure we can plug into the international grid and don't have our own unique system that is out of kilter with what may ultimately be the accepted multilateral approach,"" he said. 

Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand tax leader Michael Croker said the government needed to come up with a clearer formula about how profits are going to be taxed. 

""The legislation being introduced into Parliament may need to be more explicit about where the profits are being taxed,"" Mr Croker said. ""It doesn't talk about the extent to which the multinational company has paid tax elsewhere ... and there could be disputes between countries as a result."" 

Pitcher Partners tax partner Leon Mok said he was worried mid-market companies could be impacted. ""Given the implications of non-compliance are very harsh, the government needs to clarify what concessions and carve outs will be given for mid-market businesses with global parents,"" he said. 

Tax Justice Network spokesman Mark Zirnsak​ welcomed the laws, but said the government should be prepared to take further action should companies simply develop new tax dodging techniques. 

""This would include if they reduce their profits in Australia by artificially loading up their subsidiary here with things like inflated intellectual property charges,"" Mr Zirnsak said. 

""We also think the net of companies caught by the legislation should have been widened to include those with global revenues of over $250 million."" 

KPMG tax partner Grant Wardell-Johnson said although the wording of the bill was simpler, more taxpayers would have to work out whether they would be hit. ""How the ATO applies these provisions will be critical and early guidance will be important,"" he said. 

PwC international tax services partner Peter Collins​ said Australia was taking unilateral action ahead of its OECD counterparts, but it would be better to gain international consensus. ",a9378b0a-2a2e-40a2-968a-610fa548a699,News,2015-09-16T05:34:17Z,Brisbane Times,'Bad tax law': experts warn Hockey on crackdown,0.0,News

If you’re a little skeptical (very normal!), here’s what you need to know. 
 
#FullStop is the national campaign being launched by Bachpan Bachao Andolan in association with Kailash Satyarthi Children’s Foundation (founded by Nobel Peace Laureate Kailash Satyarthi ) on September 24th. Why? Because every hour, more than 2 children are sexually abused in India. The scary truth is that child sexual abuse can happen anywhere, and it does. It happens to girls as well as boys, in public places as well as in the safety of their homes. And the impact is severely damaging, often lifelong. 
 
And that’s why we need you. Because every post, every share, every tweet makes a difference! #MMKarma 
 
#FullStop is a campaign to raise awareness on all forms of child sexual abuse. By talking about the problem, you become a part of the solution. Together, we need to end the silence, end the hurt. Full Stop. 
 
Where do you start? Right here! Sign up for the Thunderclap at  http://thndr.it/1Nu5Cvi and be a part of the launch of #FullStop on September 24th (PS: the dedicated website, that’s www.fullstop.org.in , goes live at the same time). 
 
We’ve already spotted Kalki Koechlin, Vijender Singh, Ashwin Mushran, Nikhil Chinapa, Sarah Brown, Pooja Dhingra , and many others, joining the #Thunderclap to pledge their support!

1665,"(CNN) -  
You may not be lucky enough to meet Pope Francis when he visits New York, Philadelphia and Washington later this month. 
 
But you can still try to make him laugh. 

A new digital campaign, ""Joke with the Pope,"" is encouraging people to submit jokes -- no dirty ones, please -- as part of a contest to fund charitable causes, sanctioned by the Catholic Church, that help the world's less fortunate. 

Between now and October 2, anyone -- not just Catholics -- can post a written joke or upload a brief video of themselves telling a joke to JokeWiththePope.org. Contestants choose one of three causes to support: helping street children in Buenos Aires, Argentina; housing the homeless in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; or feeding the hungry in Nairobi, Kenya. 

A panel of judges, with the possible help of actor-comedian Bill Murray, will choose a winner October 5. The funniest joke may even get shared with the pontiff himself. 

""I like to laugh. It helps me to feel closer to God and closer to other people. When we laugh with each other -- and not at each other -- God's love is present in a special way,"" said Pope Francis in a statement provided by the Pontifical Mission Societies, which created the campaign. 

""I invite you to share your joy with a laugh! God longs for you to be happy!"" the pope said. ""Share your jokes and your funny stories: the world will be better, the Pope will be happy and God will be the happiest of all."" 

A handful of celebrities, including magician David Copperfield and TV weatherman Al Roker, have already submitted videos of themselves telling jokes. Conan O'Brien offered this: ""The California drought is so bad, people in Napa are asking the pope to change the wine into water."" 

The Pontifical Mission Societies will bestow the title of ""honorary comedic adviser to the pope"" on whoever wins the contest and donate $10,000 to the cause chosen by the winner. 

The Catholic Church's official support organization for overseas missions, the Pontifical Mission Societies provide education, health care and other services to the world's neediest people while spreading Christianity around the globe. The mission societies just launched a new mobile app, Missio, to help users explore worthy causes and donate to specific projects. 

The Rev. Andrew Small, national director of the Pontifical Mission Societies in the United States, said the ""Joke with the Pope"" campaign is a way to spread laughter and unite people while helping the world's neediest communities. The campaign is also a tribute of sorts to Pope Francis, who has a well-documented sense of humor. 

""Humor is something that we all share -- every culture, every people,"" Small said. ""If you can tell a joke and laugh at someone else's joke, it shows there's a certain level of comfort with one another."" 

Religious jokes and even pope jokes are welcome, Small said. But contestants must respect limits of decency. In other words, Small said, don't submit a joke you wouldn't tell in front of the pope.",046b37f8-8ef7-4ccd-a1f5-5ca7bd9632e8,News,2015-09-11T13:15:35Z,ABC 17 News,Catholic church promotes 'Joke with the Pope',0.0,News

2954,"The head bankster thinks the country is looking for a ""dealmaker."" WSJ has the details:
One of Wall Street’s top executives sought to explain Donald Trump’s surprising appeal as a presidential candidate, noting the real-estate developer and reality-television star may have tapped into voters’ longing for more dealmakers in Washington.
“We’ve put together a country that lets everyone into Washington with an absolute pledge not to compromise on anything,” Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s chairman and chief executive, said Wednesday during a talk at The Wall Street Journal’s “Viewpoints” executive-leadership series in Midtown Manhattan. “And then Trump comes along and talks the language of dealing.”
Mr. Blankfein, a Democrat, stopped well short of endorsing Mr. Trump’s run. Some of Mr. Trump’s statements, the Wall Street executive said, are “wacky.” And the image of Mr. Trump “with his finger on the button blows my mind,” he added, drawing laughter from the audience.
Yet his candidacy may signal voters are ready to support politicians who are willing to compromise and “get the best deal for my set of positions.”
“Nobody who listens to him thinks he’s ideologically stuck on the most extreme position,” Mr. Blankfein said of Mr. Trump.
An avid reader of history, Mr. Blankfein went back to the early 1800s when an unconventional candidate named Andrew Jackson won the presidency.
“What must people have been thinking when he got elected?” he said of Jackson, an “unkempt and noisy” populist from the woods who ended the line of establishment candidates in the nation’s highest office. “Could that be happening now?
“We’re being kind of dismissive of things. But people must’ve dismissed that.”
When asked if he could live with Mr. Trump in the White House, Mr. Blankfein demurred: “I didn’t say that.”",1e510a66-ab1b-4f03-b86b-97f8a5ded11f,Blog,2015-09-16T17:10:00Z,EconomicPolicyJournal.com,Lloyd Blankfein on Donald Trump,1.0,Blog

Bernt Wahl, who is on the faculty at UC Berkeley, was hoping for more from Apple following Wednesday’s new product releases, with included a new iPad Pro and a new iPhone. ‘I don’t think they created anything that was really mind boggling today, not like the old days when Steve Jobs would have something tremendously insightful’ said Wahl. He added that as Apple has gotten bigger, it’s rate of innovation has slowed. ‘They’re not willing to take the risks that they were able to take earlier,’ he said. ‘Now they are resting on their laurels.’ Wahl expects Apple will make incremental improvements, but other than the Apple Watch, he hasn’t seen a new innovation come out in the last couple of years.

1477,"Microsoft Corp. announced on Wednesday a new commitment of $70 million in community investments over the next three years to increase access to computer science education for all youth, and especially for those from under-represented backgrounds. Through the company's global YouthSpark initiative, scores of nonprofit organizations around the world will receive cash donations and other resources to provide computer science education to diverse populations of young people in their communities and prepare them with the computational-thinking and problem-solving skills necessary for success in an increasingly digital world. 
  
Invests $70 million in community programs to increase access to computer science education for all youth and build greater diversity into the tech talent pipeline. 

SAN FRANCISCO , Sept. 16, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Microsoft Corp. announced on Wednesday a new commitment of $70 million in community investments over the next three years to increase access to computer science education for all youth, and especially for those from under-represented backgrounds. Through the company's global YouthSpark initiative, scores of nonprofit organizations around the world will receive cash donations and other resources to provide computer science education to diverse populations of young people in their communities and prepare them with the computational-thinking and problem-solving skills necessary for success in an increasingly digital world. 
   
""If we are going to solve tomorrow's global challenges, we must come together today to inspire young people everywhere with the promise of technology,"" said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella . ""We can't leave anyone out. We're proud to make this $70 million investment in computer science education to create new opportunities for students across the spectrum of diverse youth and help build a tech talent pipeline that will spark new innovations for the future."" 

Over the next three years, Microsoft will deliver on this commitment through cash grants and nonprofit partnerships as well as unique program and content offerings to increase access to computer science education and build computational thinking skills for diverse populations of youth. One of the flagship programs is Technology Education and Literacy in Schools (TEALS), which pairs tech professionals from across the industry with classroom educators to team-teach computer science in U.S. high schools. TEALS aims to grow fivefold in the next three years, with the goal of working with 2,000 tech industry volunteers to reach 30,000 students in nearly 700 schools across 33 states. A key objective of TEALS is to support classroom educators as they learn the computer science coursework, preparing them to teach computer science independently after two years of team-teaching. 

Nadella reinforced the company's commitment to computer science education today during the annual Dreamforce conference hosted by Salesforce where he called upon thousands of tech professionals to serve as TEALS volunteers and help broaden the opportunity for students of all backgrounds to learn computer science in high school. 

""Computer science is a foundational subject — like algebra, chemistry or physics — for learning how the world works, yet it's offered in less than 25 percent of American high schools,"" said Microsoft President Brad Smith . ""We need to increase access to computer science and computational thinking for all students, especially those from diverse populations, by partnering across the industry and with teachers and schools to turn this situation around and change the paradigm for developing a more diverse tech talent pipeline."" 

There are three additional key elements of Microsoft's global commitment to increasing access for all youth to the full range of computing skills, from digital literacy to computer science. 
Global philanthropic investments with nonprofits in 80 countries, including the Center for Digital Inclusion in Latin America , Silatech in the Middle East and Africa , CoderDojo Foundation in Europe , YCAB Foundation in Asia , and many others, will deliver a range of computing skills from digital literacy to computer science education to youth in local communities around the world. Microsoft Imagine connects students with the tools, resources and experiences they need to turn their innovative ideas into reality. Whether it's building a game or designing an app, Microsoft Imagine makes learning to code easy and accessible for students and educators, no matter their age or skill level and at no cost. Whether it's free cloud services like Azure, online competitions via Imagine Cup that educators can incorporate into their curriculum, or fun self-serve learning tutorials, Microsoft Imagine helps bring a student's technology passion to life through computer science. YouthSpark Hub resources are designed to inspire youth about the full spectrum of computing skills, ranging from digital literacy to computer science engineering. In addition to providing access to the Microsoft Imagine tools, the YouthSpark Hub brings together opportunities to participate in activities such as DigiGirlz and YouthSpark Live, attend free YouthSpark Camps at the Microsoft Stores, and access training through nonprofit organizations supported by Microsoft around the world. 
Since 2012, Microsoft YouthSpark has created new opportunities for more than 300 million youth around the world, offering technology skills training and connections to employment, entrepreneurship, and continued education or training.

1372,"President Obama kicked off a multiday visit to Alaska on August 31, with the intention of highlighting the effects of climate change unfolding in real-time. He will point to the shrinking ice, rising sea levels, land erosion, and melting permafrost as evidence that the world must act to reduce greenhouse emissions. 
 
Alaska is bearing the brunt of climate change worse than other parts of the world. “This is an issue that is very here and now,” Brian Deese, a top climate advisor to Obama, told reporters ahead of the President’s visit. “The issue of climate change is not an issue of the future tense in Alaska. It is affecting people in their lives and livelihoods in real ways.” 
 
At the same time, not too far from his visit, is a major Arctic oil project that his administration just approved, underscoring the contradictions within the U.S. government about fossil fuel production and the need to address climate change.

“It’s inconsistent on the one hand for President Obama to lead the world toward comprehensive action on climate change, while on the other allowing companies to pursue difficult, expensive oil in dangerous and remote places,” Michael LeVine, senior counsel for environmental group Oceana, told the New York Times . 
 
The timing is indeed a bit awkward. Royal Dutch Shell is in the midst of drilling campaign in the Chukchi Sea, which Obama’s Interior Department recently green-lighted. Shell has a tight window in which to drill. By the time Shell’s icebreaker completed repairs in Portland, OR, managed to navigate through Greenpeace protestors , and arrived on site, Shell was left with little margin for error. The Anglo-Dutch company will essentially have just August and September to drill in the Burger prospect, before it has to shut operations down for the winter. 
 
Acknowledging his approval of Shell’s drilling plans, Obama argued in his weekly radio address that he wants the nation to move beyond fossil fuels – in Anchorage on Monday he called for aggressive action on climate change – but that in the interim, while the nation is still hooked on oil and gas, it would be better to produce domestically than to import. 
 
Related: Could Oil Sink Below $40 Per Barrel Again? 
 
There is strong environmental opposition to Arctic drilling, and protests were held in Anchorage in response to Obama’s visit. But there is also a lot of pressure at the state level to expand oil and gas drilling in Alaska. At issue is the state’s overwhelming dependence on oil production for its economy, and state revenues have been battered by the twin calamities of falling oil production and collapsing prices. Moreover, the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline, which runs 800 miles from Alaska’s North Slope to the state’s southern coast, is running dry due to falling oil production. Oil flows in the pipeline are declining by about 5 percent per year. 
 
“We have an oil pipeline that’s two-thirds empty,” Alaska’s Governor Bill Walker, told Bloomberg. “It’s easy for people to predict what will or won’t happen, but as governor I can’t take that chance. Right now, about 75 percent of our revenue comes from that oil pipeline.” To make matters worse, the pipeline becomes more difficult to operate when oil flows drop below a certain level. More pump stations will likely be needed to keep up pipeline pressure if oil flows fall below 300,000 barrels per day. Thus, for the Alaskan government, declining oil production is an urgent problem. “I think that he’ll have a better appreciation when he’s up here, kind of what the need is in Alaska,” the state’s governor said. 
 
Related: Why So Much Oil Price Volatility? Blame The Speculators 
 
Meanwhile, Shell is facing some pretty harsh conditions in the Arctic. On August 28, the company was forced to halt drilling operations because of high winds. But even if Shell is successful with its drilling operations in the Chukchi Sea, the company doesn’t expect to bring oil online until the end of the next decade. 
 
Taking all of these competing interests into account, the President is trying to pull off a tough balancing act. But another factor to consider is the possibility that the White House is losing enthusiasm for Arctic drilling behind the scenes, even while the administration approved Shell’s permits and the President continues to justify his government’s actions. The National Journal reported on August 28 that the Interior Department has not started work on the environmental assessment for the Arctic drilling leases that it is expected to auction off in 2016. 
 
Since that process can take two years to complete, there appears to be a growing possibility that the auction could be delayed or cancelled. If that were to happen, any new acreage would not be sold until the next administration. And if the next President is a Democrat, Arctic drilling could be shelved altogether given the candidates’ outspoken opposition to the idea.

1228,"The Fat Jew, whose real name is Joel Otrovsky, revealed that his New York Fashion Week show will highlight 'real dads' The 30-year-old New York entertainer shot to notoriety in 2014 and gained more than 5 million followers on Instagram  Says the collection will include 'a lot of Rockports', 'sensible walking shoes', 'khakis' and 'pajamas with big giant plastic buttons'  
He calls himself 'the world's first plus-sized male model', and now the Fat Jew has revealed that he is bringing his brand of 'dad fashion' to the mainstream with his upcoming New York Fashion Week show. 

The Fat Jew, whose real name is Joel Otrovsky, revealed some secrets about his upcoming show at the Alexander Wang tenth anniversary New York Fashion Week event on Saturday - and told  Yahoo Style  that the catwalk will be 'like nothing the industry has ever seen' because it will be 'highlighting regular dads with very normal bodies'.  

In contrast to the star-studded guests surrounding him at the glamorous event, including Lady Gaga, Zoe Kravitz, The Weeknd, Bella Hadid, Tyga, and Kylie Jenner, the 30-year-old designer said that he cast The Dad Fashion Show rather randomly using 'a lot of Craigslist, and some real dads that I know'. 
   
Dad fashion: The Fat Jew, whose real name is Joel Otrovsky, said that he scouted unknown models on Craigslist for his New York Fashion Week collection  

He explained that the presentation, which will take place at the MADE Studios​ on September 16th, will also feature 'dad s**t' including 'a lot of Rockports', 'sensible walking shoes', 'khakis' and 'pajamas with big giant plastic buttons'. 

But The Fat Jew is not limiting his activities to high fashion: The funnyman also revealed that he is 'deejaying and hosting a sweet sixteen in New Jersey for a girl whose father either invented cruise control or the roof rack, I can’t remember which one'. 

'Yeah, I don’t know if I should be around that many 16 year olds, but this is happening. They hired me off Twitter. AND they put in the contract that I have to keep my shirt on,' he added.   
   
Fashion faux pas? Despite his unique sense of style and outspoken views about the industry, The Fat Jew has become one of NYFW's most unlikely front row stars 
   
Famous friends: The social media star has proved a hit with many Hollywood A-listers, including Justin Bieber (pictured) 

He confessed, however, that he was tempted to show off his 'Shrek body', since 'it takes a lot of work to look this s****y'.  

The New York-based entertainer, who shot to fame in 2014 after gaining five million Instagram followers in a matter of months, went on to say that sometimes it is all about the paycheck. 

'I wish it was a quinceanera, so if you’re having a quinceanera, please hire me,' he added. 'I will literally do whatever you want.' 

On that note, he said that in lieu of tiny canapes, his show will feature hoagies and Hotel California on repeat.   
   
Comedy: Ostrovsky's quirky - and occasionally controversial - breed of humor has made him a huge success on social media

4890,"LONDON , Sept. 2, 2015 /PRNewswire/ — About construction market in Bahrain 
Despite the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the construction market in Bahrain has managed to gain momentum. This can be attributed to the significant investment opportunities in several sectors such as restaurants, manufacturing, transport, construction, wholesale, and healthcare. The construction market in Bahrain can be categorized into four segments: transportation, energy and resources, industrial, and commercial. When the four sectors are evaluated individually, the transportation sector had the highest spending in 2014.

1957,"One of the challenges facing designers of traditional flat solar panels is the fact that the sun doesn't conveniently stay in one place. This means that in order for a panel to receive as much sunlight as possible, it has to pan with the sun as it moves across the sky. While there are motorized assemblies designed to do just that, they add complexity, weight and expense to photovoltaic systems. Now, however, University of Michigan scientists have developed a simpler alternative – and it's based on the ancient Japanese cut-paper art of kirigami.

The U Michigan engineers consulted with Matthew Shlian, a paper artist who also lectures at the university's School of Art and Design. He showed them a kirigami pattern that would suite their purposes...

Infinix Cardiovascular X-ray and Aquilion ONE CT Help Facilitate Successful Angioplasty of Intracranial Stenosis 
 
TUSTIN, Calif., Sept. 23, 2015 – Ronald Cooper of Sydney, Australia, suffered two small strokes and found his basilar artery 90 to 95 percent blocked. His local doctors placed him on medication that offered him little hope for improvement. After his daughter exhaustively searched alternatives, she came across the Gates Vascular Institute (GVI) in Buffalo, New York, and its leadership in conducting successful submaximal angioplasty, a vascular procedure that provides an alternative to stenting and medical therapy. 
 
Mr. Cooper traveled to Buffalo and underwent a successful procedure that saw him return to Australia with his blockage cleared. In the planning and execution of the angioplasty, GVI used Toshiba’s Aquilion TM ONE CT’s perfusion capabilities to confirm a severe narrowing of Mr. Cooper’s intracranial basilar artery. The team then utilized the Infinix™ Elite cardiovascular X-ray system’s superior visualization to carry out the angioplasty to expand the artery and immediately improve blood flow. The decision to use this over the commonly used medical therapy saved his life and prevented a potentially devastating stroke. 
 
“While many physicians don’t consider interventional solutions for this condition, our facility has a strong track record of effectively using submaximal angioplasty to treat intracranial stenosis,” said Adnan Siddiqui, M.D., Ph.D., director of neurosurgical stroke service, Buffalo General Medical Center and Gates Vascular Institute, and professor of neurosurgery and radiology at the University of Buffalo. “The Toshiba systems allowed us to properly assess the situation and effectively use this technique in a manner that allowed the patient to be discharged the next day and be on his way home to Sydney in ten days’ time.” 
 
“The safety and experience of patients treated with our systems is the major influence in our system designs,” said Satrajit Misra, vice president, Marketing, Toshiba. “The use of multiple Toshiba systems across the CT and X-ray/vascular modalities for this procedure highlights that as these therapies evolve, physicians trust our systems to give them the tools they need for success.”

3599,"The Government of India is proposing to lease 40% of the country’s forests, classified as “degraded”, to private companies to improve and restore forest landscapes. Earlier this week, the All India Forum of Forest Movements (AIFFM) put out a statement opposing this proposed privatisation of India’s forests. Last month, India’s Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change issued guidelines on “Participation of Private Sector in Afforestation of Degraded Forests”. The AIFFM statement notes that the proposal is in breach of several statutes including the Forest Rights Act, the Panchayat Extension to Scheduled Area Act, the Indian Forest Act, and the Forest Conservation Act. While the Ministry of Environment’s guidelines mention safeguards for forest rights and protecting tribal interests, the guidelines allow no space for community involvement. The Hindustan Times reports that the guidelines state that: It has been felt that ongoing national afforestry programmes have not been able to make the desired impact in improving productivity and quality of forest cover due to a lack of sufficient investment, capacity, technological upgradation and adequate skilled manpower.
 
Thus there is need to look at options including how private sector can contribute in improving and restoring forest landscapes apart from meeting the vital requirement of various forest products. But as the AIFFM points out “improving and restoring forest landscapes” in reality will involve establishing industrial tree plantations. India’s pulp and paper industry has been lobbying for decades to get its hands on the country’s degraded forests. A former director of the Indian Institute of Forest Managment in Bhopal commented to the Hindustan Times, “Even the most degraded natural forests have 50-100 species of trees per hectare. For their end products, industries would hardly plant one or two species.” These “degraded” forests are also crucially important for rural communities. Dr N. C. Saxena was a member of India’s Planning Commission. In a paper titled “Tenurial Issues in Forestry in India”, Saxena argued against handing over degraded forests to private companies: Such lands may have a low tree density, but satisfy the fuelwood, fodder and livelihood needs of about 100 million people. In fact, these lands are degraded because they suffer from extreme biotic pressure, and require neither capital investment, nor higher technology, but protection and recuperation, which can be done only by working with the people, where industry has neither expertise nor patience. The West Bengal experience shows that about 2000 peoples’ forest protection committees have regenerated more than 300,000 hectares of sal forests at little extra investment, simply by protection on the promise of sharing wood and non-wood products with them. If lands on which peoples’ livelihoods are dependent are given to industry, they may have to employ muscle power to keep people at bay, thus escalating social tensions, which are already quite acute in several forest and park areas. In April 2014, the Ministry of Environment published a draft National REDD+ Policy and Strategy. One of the objectives of the REDD+ Policy is, to lay emphasis on achieving various thematic elements of SMF by addressing the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation, afforestation of degraded areas, protection measures, etc. while implementing the REDD+ programmes Because of the failure to differentiate between industrial tree plantations and forests, the pulp and paper industry’s monoculture tree plantations would slot neatly into India’s proposed REDD plans, as “afforestation of degraded areas”. Our Forests are not for Sale! Stop Privatizing India’s Forests!  
A Press Release by All India Forum of Forest Movements(AIFFM)
 
21 September 2015
 
Recent guidelines sent by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) to state governments and UTs [Union Territories], confirm that Government of India has finally made up its mind about allowing ‘forest concessions’ to private sector companies in what it perceives as state-owned forests. We learn from various media reports and the leaked guidelines that 40 percent of ‘identified’ degraded forests could be given away on lease to private companies for raising plantations, and as the Minister Prakash Javadekar has said, to bring back forests where there were no forests. The same minister has earlier this year remarked that ‘diversion of forests’ is a negative phrase, it should be replaced with ‘reforestation’, because aren’t the agencies who use forest lands for activities such as mining, dam-building and tourism paying for compensatory afforestation, in other words, raising new forests?
 
The Minister represents his government in what he has been saying, and whatever decisions his Ministry has been taking for last 16 odd months, follow a conscious pattern.
 
The pattern is simple. The present Government of India, which means the Indian state, is intent on neo-liberalizing the environment. Going by experiences from across the world, that means destroying it altogether, or changing and maiming it solely in the interest of capital. Environment and business, environment and investment, environment and development must go together, we are told daily. Environment must not impede growth, we are reminded.
 
Because state always knows best, what the law says does not matter. The idea of handing over so-called degraded forests to corporations violates not one but several statutes such as Forest Rights Act and PESA, and also Indian Forest Act and Forest Conservation Act. The first two stipulate that communities and community institutions such as gram Sabha will determine the future use of forests and forest land. The next two, taken together, have no provision for privately owned or leased ‘state’ forests. The MoEF guidelines mention safeguards for forest rights, and protecting tribal interests. In the same breath, they allow no space for community intervention in the entire process, and limit community use of future leased out forests to only 10-15 percent of the total leased area. Finally, and most importantly, plantations are not forests: irrespective of species being planted, a plantation can not replace or in any way replicate the biodiversity even a so-called degraded natural forest support, and the sustenance they provide to local communities.
 
The Government can not change laws at will. Its executive powers do not extend to amending them, or changing them in such a way that the constitutional and legal essence of such laws are altered. Yet the present government keeps on doing precisely this; realising that they lack the requisite majority in parliament for amending the statutes, a governance through decrees, ordinances and executive fiat is replacing the rule of law altogether.
 
The Government has also recently announced an unbelievable 15 billion US$ package for new plantations, which, it was said, the government already had. On top of that, the government needs yet more money for plantations? What is the game that is being played, really?
 
We apprehend that the ambitious and now corporatized plantation programme of the present government will be used to greenwash its emphasis on coal mining, and continuing with coal as the primary source of electricity generation, in international climate negotiations. The proposed private plantations can also be used in the dubious game of domestic carbon trading. It also follows logically that that the present scheme of allowing private plantations inside reserved forests will also be shown in future as a REDD plus activity because it will help restock the depleting carbon stores in degraded forests.
 
In reality, the plantations will disempower and dispossess people, not only through land grab, but also by promoting more new mining throughout our forests.
 
We protest against these undemocratic and underhand exercises of commoditising nature, the conspiracy of deliberately undermining the power of grassroots communities over the nature they use and live with. Forests are not meant for corporate profit, they are life support systems. Degraded forests must be identified and regenerated and restored, democratically and ecologically, through the agency of communities and their gram sabhas. They can not be, under any circumstances, given away to corporations.
 
We call for an unified resistance against the machinations of the government, in defense of our forest commons.

1450,"The new Alfa Romeo is a throwback to the Italian company’s great racing days — a lightweight, turbo-charged, four-cylinder sports car, stripped to the essentials. Have they gone too far? This car is a real hooligan. 

Propelled by 237 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque, the mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive 4C Spider goes from zero to 60 in 4.1 seconds and achieves a top speed of 160 mph. It sits low and squat, a carbon fibre tub with a grumpy, growly face. Nothing is wasted. It’s gorgeous, but forget the frills. 

Inside, the minimalism is even more apparent. The dash is spare. There’s no infotainment system. There’s no glove compartment, no centre console, and the interior storage space is limited to a tiny cubby hidden behind the cup holder. Even the hard, narrow seats, which adjust manually, seem designed to make you feel as if you’re at the track. 

The engine is loud. The manual rack-and-pinion steering is stiff and twitchy. The ride is bumpy and abrasive. Knocking around town, the 4C is hard work. 

But the car finds itself under acceleration. The steering steadies and the stiff suspension start making sense. And that noisy, raspy engine turns out to be fast — wicked fast. The turbo feels like a shot of adrenaline. 

Alfa Romeo, now owned by the giant Fiat Chrysler corporation, is hoping to find a middle ground between its siblings Fiat and Ferrari. The company is making a concerted effort to re-enter the American market, starting with this crop-top sports car. 

It’s clearly not for everybody and maybe almost nobody. This car is clearly more about brand image than volume sales. First of all, the driver will have to be nimble. Getting down into the 4C requires some agility. Getting out, more so. 

Turning it into a convertible is complicated too. The canvas T-top, which is held in place by four levers and two bolts, rolls up and tucks into the very small trunk space. But putting the top back in place, and managing those four levers and two bolts, is more hard work. Bring two people, four hands and your engineering degree. 

Some devotees of the raw, unrefined sports car experience may balk at the automatic transmission. But the 4C isn’t offered with a manual transmission and won’t be, the company says, because the automatic transmission, and its paddle shifters, does a better job of shifting gears, and because too few people will order the car with a stick shift. 

Indeed, the paddle shifters do mean the manual transmission isn’t a necessity. The rev-matching downshift function works beautifully, and with the exception of a rather tall first gear, and the resulting tendency of the 4C to whine a bit at take-off, the automatic transmission maximises the horsepower. 

But it’s hard not to imagine purists complaining that they want their pure sports car in its pure form. The manual transmission version of the new Mazda MX-5 Miata, for example, accounts for nearly half of all sales, the company said at the recent introduction of the new version of its classic two-seater though it could be argued that the smaller motor in that drop-top requires a manual where the larger, hotter Alfa motor does not. 

For fuel economy, Alfa Romeo says the 4C gets 24 miles per gallon in the city and 34 on the highway. (Real-world mileage will certainly be less for drivers who put the car to its intended purpose.) 

A harder number for prospective buyers will be the price. The 4C starts at $65,495 and, with the track package, special wheels and custom paint on this model, can cost as much as $77,000. 

That’s not a lot less than it costs to get into a comparably fast European sports car, like those made by Audi, BMW, Mercedes or Porsche which don’t require the same sacrifices in daily driver comfort. The Boxster GTS costs almost the same as the 4C, produces just as much power and handles as well or better. So does an F-Type Jaguar. 

The anticipated new Fiat 124 Spider, which will have the same Japan-built chassis and some drive-train elements as the Mazda MX-5 but will have its own Italian-made bodywork, will cost considerably less than a 4C when it arrives some time in late 2016 or early 2017. 

The drivers caught in this Spider’s web are going to be real enthusiasts, who remember and love the great Alfa Romeo racing history, and want to be part of the company’s push to get back on American roads.

2939,"Mike Pettine started Josh McCown at quarterback because the Cleveland Browns coach thought the 36-year-old veteran gave his team the best chance to win. The Browns did not win. They lost. Bad. To the Oakland Raiders. At home. So, one could understand the ""Johnny"" chants echoing through Cleveland.   Johnny, in this instance, is not Jack Nicholson's character in ""The Shining,"" although Sunday's 27-20 loss was somewhat of a horror show. He's a second-year quarterback by the name of Johnny Manziel. Maybe you've heard of him. He led the Browns to their only win of the season in his Week 2 start.   McCown has apparently heard of this Manziel fella, too,  explaining as much to USA Today's Nancy Armour.     “There were Johnny chants?” McCown asked facetiously after the 27-20 loss to the Oakland Raiders. “Like I said Wednesday, I understand the situation I’m in and it’s part of it. He’s an exciting young player that I know people want to see play. I understand that.       “For me, I have to focus on where we are. We had our own problems and own issues just trying to move the ball.”     In all seriousness, though, if the Browns are going to be the same old Browns — the franchise that hasn't sniffed a championship since the 1960s — why not start the kid they spent a first-round pick on in 2014?   Granted, McCown threw for 349 yards and a pair of touchdowns in defeat, but 237 of those yards and both scores came when the Browns were already facing deficits of 20-3 and 27-10 late in the second half. And while Cleveland's defense forced a second straight three-and-out to get the Browns the ball back with a chance to tie the game in the final 2:26, McCown threw a pick that sealed their fate in the final minute.   For the record, Pettine never considered turning to Manziel on Sunday, telling Armour, ""You can't put a player in a situation where he feels like he's playing with a short leash. Then it just becomes self-fulfilling.""   There's some truth to that, so the decision should come Monday instead — ride with Manziel, for better or worse. At least one NFL player with knowledge of the two quarterbacks has made up his mind. Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans, who played with McCown on the Bucs last season and Manziel in college, explained his reasoning to a Tampa radio station late last week, via JoeBucsFan.com.     “I think the world of Josh, but as far as a starting job goes now, Manziel just came off a win,” Evans said on the Buccaneers Radio Network this week. “You know, the city’s buzzing about him. Everybody’s buzzing about him, won at home. I don’t know, man. I think they probably should have gave him one more chance [to start]. I mean, he won.”     Sometimes the simplest explanation is the correct one.

1156,"Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said the city has sped up the taxi bylaw review and expects a full report to be available by the end of December.

Outside consultant KPMG is expected to review fare structures, and could recommend ways to regulate, rather than ban, Uber, which currently disregards Ottawa's licensing and insurance regulations.

The Uber app allows passengers to book a ride, track it in real time on a GPS map and does away with the exchange of cash by requiring automatic credit card payment. 

The City of Ottawa maintains that Uber is illegal, and continues to target drivers in time-consuming and resource-intensive undercover stings in order to charge them.

Since Uber began operating in Ottawa in October 2014, 142 charges have been laid against 64 drivers. So far, 56 drivers have pleaded guilty to 112 charges, with fines totaling nearly $40,000, according to the City of Ottawa.

Uber has been banned or pushed out of some Canadian cities but continues to compete with traditional, regulated cabs in others.

Here's a round up of the response to Uber across the country.

Kitchener-Waterloo became the first municipality in Ontario to propose regulating ride sharing services, like Uber. The new bylaw would require all Uber drivers to have a GPS and closed circuit television system, as well as commercial auto insurance policies for a minimum of $2 million to qualify for A City of Toronto staff report up for debate today calls for a new licensing category that would allow ride-hailing services, such as Uber to operate, but taxi industry leaders continue to argue that would mean the ""death of the industry.""

Under the new licence, Uber drivers would have to buy a permit, carry insurance, undergo a background check and ensure their vehicle is safe. The report also recommends that base taxi fares be dropped by $1 to $3.25 to make traditional cabs more competitive.

The City of Edmonton has plans to legalize Uber with new regulations — but Uber drivers say the move would drive them out of business due to high costs. Uber drivers say the cost of criminal record checks, vehicle inspections, licence applications and commercial insurance would be about $6,800 a year.

Public hearings were scheduled at Edmonton City Hall today as Uber drivers planned to hold a rally outside.

These new city launches bring the total number of cities on the platform to 18 within the United States , with plans to continue expanding in 2015.

""Launching Localeur in these cities turns over a new leaf in local discovery to help travelers have more authentic experiences while also helping local businesses that can't compete with the chains listed on most review sites.""

3930,"Kinder Morgan issued a statement late today (Sept. 30) describing the benefits of the company's proposed Northeast Energy Direct natural gas pipeline. Kimberly S. Watson, president of Kinder Morgan's east region gas pipelines division, said there is a critical need for additional natural gas capacity in New England to stabilize energy prices. Watson made reference to today's trip to Washington by state Senate President Stanley Rosenberg. Rosenberg met with members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to discuss his constituents' concerns about the proposed pipeline, and also met with Dept. of Energy officials and members of Congress on matters of energy policy. Watson said she appreciated Rosenberg's efforts to involve his constituents in the federal permitting process for the proposed pipeline. The statement was issued through Crawford Strategies, a Boston-based public relations firm.  The 212-mile 30-inch line, which would cut through sections of New York, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, has met with strong opposition in the senator's district. Rosenberg has not taken a stand on the pipeline's merits, but has said he wishes to ensure a ""deliberative process"" as Kinder Morgan pursues federal approval for the project. Watson issued the following statement late Wednesday afternoon: ""We appreciate Senate President Rosenberg's efforts as the state reviews its energy strategy.
""As numerous studies have shown, there is a critical need for additional natural gas capacity in New England to stabilize sky-high electricity prices that burden residents and businesses and to support the state's objective of increasing the percentage of renewable energy. ""The NED project will help the Massachusetts economy grow both statewide and across New England. It will also help the state's impressive climate change objectives by reducing reliance on coal and fuel oil. ""Unlike other regions in the country, which are benefiting from cleaner and less costly natural gas, Massachusetts and the region will continue to pay billions more per year for its energy needs without additional natural gas capacity. ""In the development of renewable energy resources, natural gas is widely identified as the ideal bridge fuel for the intermittent nature of renewables and would, in fact, hasten a faster deployment of solar and wind energy in the state. ""We appreciate the Senate President's initiative in creating opportunities for his constituents' voices to be heard in the FERC process. We look forward to working with all interested parties who wish to participate in the process so that the best decisions can be made."" Kinder Morgan announced this week that its subsidiary Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. had executed additional agreements with anchor shippers for capacity on the proposed line. National Grid, Liberty Utilities, Columbia Gas, Connecticut Natural Gas, Southern Connecticut Gas, Berkshire Gas, and Westfield Gas & Electric were announced in March. Recently, more unnamed entities have signed up for a combined 675,000 dekatherms of capacity, according to Kinder Morgan. In March, the number hovered around 500,000 dekatherms. FERC, in its upcoming evaluation of the pipeline, will consider whether the project is economically sound, and balance benefits against adverse impacts. Kinder Morgan will seek a certificate from the federal regulators this fall. Rosenberg told reporters on Tuesday that he sees a ""disconnect"" between policy makers pushing green energy and regulatory agencies such as FERC and the state Dept. of Public Utilities, saying they are bound by outdated statutes.

They love to have their dinos play outside with them, watch them eat dinner, come to school for show and tell, watch them in movies, snuggle them in bed, make puzzles out of them.  (I feel like Bubba and his shrimp - shrimp gumbo, shrimp kabobs, shrimp soup...).

During a recent trip to the Steel City - go Steelers! We went to Carnegie Museum to check out their dino exhibit. And my kids were impressed.



There were so many dinos to see. They got to touch dino fossils

And they got to dig up in a kid-friendly dig site. Complete with safety goggles, chisels and brushes. It was adorable.



My kids keep asking when we can go back. It was such a great learning experience and it was neat for the kids to see how huge dinos really are.

1998,"Brasília - Arab Today  
Evidence gathered against two leading members of Brazil's ruling Workers Party in the Petrobras graft scandal is sufficient for them to face criminal charges, police said Tuesday. 
 
Prosecutors now must review the evidence against Jose Dirceu and Joao Vaccari and decide on charges against them and 12 others, police sources said. 
 
Prosecutors suspect Dirceu, a former cabinet chief under ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva (2003-2010) and a cofounder of the leftist party known as PT, of having masterminded the operation. 
 
The alleged scheme skimmed billions of dollars from the state oil giant and sent the money to political parties, and people's private accounts. 
 
Police also said evidence shows that Vaccari -- who was arrested when he was treasurer of the Workers Party, and has already been charged in connection with the scandal  -- actively and passively engaged in corruption, money laundering and racketeering. 
 
Lula was in office from 2003 to 2010 and was the country's first democratically elected leftist leader. 
 
He spent generously on social programs to reduce the number of Brazilians living in poverty and the economy boomed to the world's seventh largest. 
 
On his heels, President Dilma Rousseff has been re-elected, but her popularity is at a staggering low eight percent, with the economy in recession and her government rocked by corruption scandals. 
 
Rousseff herself has not been accused, but she chaired the board at Petrobras between 2003 and 2010, when much of the alleged corruption was flourishing. 
 
Prosecutors estimate that $2.1 billion in bribes were paid as part of the scheme. 
 
Lula is being investigated in an unrelated influence-peddling probe, but has not been charged.

3473,"She sparked controversy in 2012 when she returned to work just 2 weeks after giving birth to her son. Now, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer plans on taking a short 2 week maternity leave again despite expecting twin girls. 

Though the official maternity leave for Yahoo is 16 weeks, Marissa had this to say via her Tumblr page ; 

With great happiness, Zack and I have some exciting news to share – I’m pregnant! In fact, I’m expecting identical twin girls, likely arriving in December. The twins part was quite a surprise, because I have no family history of twins or any other predisposing factors. However, as I’ve now learned, identical twins occur by random chance in roughly 1 out of approximately every 300 pregnancies. Zack and I have embraced the surprise and are very excited about these new additions to our family. 

Since my pregnancy has been healthy and uncomplicated and since this is a unique time in Yahoo’s transformation, I plan to approach the pregnancy and delivery as I did with my son three years ago, taking limited time away and working throughout. I’ve shared the news and my plans with Yahoo’s Board of Directors and my executive team, and they are incredibly supportive and happy for me. I want to thank them for all of their encouragement as well as their offers of help and continued support. 

40 year old Mayer is one of the leading female CEOs in the world and her decision is once again sparking a major discussion. Some are commending her on not allowing her personal life interrupt her work while others are criticising her decision for setting unrealistic expectations for new mothers.

Regular readers of TheMarketingblog will know that we have been following the development of the #HandCSocial campaign from Hospitality & Catering News with enthusiasm. We picked up a tweet earlier today from one of the leading marketing agencies in the hospitality, catering and foodservice industry who seem to share our enthusiasm, The Hub.

The decision to extend the #HandCSocial RoundTable to Manchester came through one of the event sponsors Peter Kitchin, MD of C&C Catering and then backed by another, Daniel Nevitt, Group Marketing Director at Armourcoat. It now already looks like that decision has paid off through support from across the industry. We spoke earlier with Denis Sheehan at Hospitality & Catering News who organised the events. “The roundtables bring together like minded users of social media from every sector across our industry. When Peter came up with the idea to additionally locate in the north widening the scope and reach of #HandCSocial it made complete sense. Daniel supported the idea immediately and the wider support that we are now getting from previous attendees like The Hub is very encouraging. We are gathering data from a survey that in part will in part set the agenda at Daniel Nevitt,on the night. Although most seats at the table are now taken the survey does offer those that complete the opportunity to join us. All that complete the survey will also receive a copy of the report before we publish it.” TheMarketingblog will also publish the report so that our readers can also see the results as well as a full review of the #HandCSocial roundtable at Hotel Football on October 1st.

2383,"Saudi Arabia is defending itself against criticism after a stampede in Mecca killed at least 717 hajj pilgrims and injured more than 850 others — the worst such incident in a quarter century. 

The BBC reports that Iran's Supreme National Security Council accused Riyadh of ""incompetence"" for the government's handling of security and called on the Saudis to take responsibility for the deaths. Saudi King Salman has ordered a safety review of the annual pilgrimage. 

Pilgrims from Iran make up the bulk of the deaths reported so far. 

""Unfortunately, these incidents happen in a moment,"" Interior Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Mansour al-Turki said at a news conference. 

The stampede occurred Thursday as the faithful carried out a symbolic stoning of the devil by throwing pebbles against three stone walls. Turki said that initial reports indicated that ""two crowds coming from opposing directions converged at an intersection in Mina, on the outskirts of Mecca, when the pushing and shoving started,"" according to Associated Press reports. 

AP reporter Aya Batrawy, speaking on Thursday's All Things Considered , said that ""from the survivors that I spoke to, they say that for them, it's pretty clear that the Saudi authorities didn't manage the crowds properly."" 

NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton reports that ""there's been sharp criticism of the Saudi organizing authorities and a backlash against reported comments on Saudi-owned al-Arabiya TV. The network reportedly quotes the head of the central hajj committee blaming the stampede on the lack of discipline by some African pilgrims."" 

The AP says that hajj drew 2 million people from more than 180 countries this year and adds that it's ""a huge logistical challenge for Saudi Arabia. The kingdom has spent billions of dollars to accommodate the growing number of pilgrims and maintain safety and security at Islam's holy cities of Mecca and Medina for the annual event.""",24bb4379-d23e-446f-9567-5bf712df478c,News,2015-09-25T12:44:00Z,WWNO,Saudi Arabia Faces Criticism Over Hajj Stampede That Killed 700,0.0,News
2402,"Hi again. I came to interrupt your pumpkin-spice latte time this morning with this Espresso Brownie Pie . That’s right. Pumpkin takes a back seat to make room for this fudgy chocolate pie. 
 
When I first discovered the original Brownie Walnut Pie in the recipe archives, I thought, hmm, “brownie plus pie, you can’t really go wrong there”. You’ve got a traditional pastry style crust filled with a fudgy chocolate brownie and served with whipped cream. I’m sold. 
 

 
The bakery where I worked in high school had this amazing chocolate walnut pie, which I hope to make some day, but I thought this recipe would be a good place to start. 
 
This recipe is rather simple. You start with a homemade crust, throw together a few ingredients to make the brownie layer and pop it in the oven for about 45 minutes and ta-da, you’ve got pie! 
 

 
Instead of following the original recipe, I swapped out the walnuts for crushed espresso beans (chocolate covered ones!). A few weeks ago, I stocked up on chocolate covered espresso beans and still had some left. If you have never baked with these, I must say, you are missing out! I first tried them in a cookie , and then again in some cookie dough ice cream . Both were down right awesome. 
 
It is best to pulse the beans in a food processor a few times to break them into small pieces. All you need to do is stir them into the brownie batter, and you’re done. 
 

 
I happened to use a deeper-than-normal pie plate, but not quite “deep dish”. It was perfect for this pie because the brownie rose a bit in the oven as it baked. I allowed it to cool completely before cutting. The top of the brownie was nice and flaky and the middle was very fudgy! I brought this into work and my coworkers loved it! 
 
Walnuts are great, but the chocolate covered espresso beans really take this recipe over the top. Here is original recipe for Brownie Walnut Pie , just leave out the walnuts and add 1 cup of crushed chocolate covered espresso beans.",84401cde-c257-4cc0-a452-0046882088fd,Blog,2015-09-24T13:27:54Z,BHG Delish Dish,Espresso Brownie Pie,1.0,News

5368,"The snack aisle at your local supermarket may look a lot healthier in five years. (Ben Schumin) Perhaps the introduction of the so-called healthier, more adult-focused Thin Oreos earlier this year was a sign that Mondelez, the maker behind the cookies and a plethora of other snacks, was on the fast track to being a health-conscious brand. The company vowed today to revamp its offering so that in five years 50% of its revenue comes from healthy snacks. Executive vice president and chief growth officer Mark Clouse says in the release that the company currently records just one-third of its sales from healthy snacks. “We intend to become the global leader in well-being snacks,” he says in a statement. “Our goal is to simplify and enhance the ingredient and nutritional profile of our base business while also focusing on breakthrough innovation to address consumers’ well-being needs.” To achieve the new health-focused goal, Clouse says the company will dedicate 70% of new product development efforts on “well-being platforms.” Those efforts will likely include more individually wrapped snacks that are 200 calories or less and products that have nutritional attributes, such as fewer ingredients and no artificial flavors, Reuters reports. “If you look at where consumers are going, we have to better position the portfolio to fully unlock the potential for growth,” Clouse said. In addition to turning toward more healthy fare, Mondelez reaffirmed on Thursday its commitment to increasing revenue of organic products by 3% this year.

207,"American regains No. 1 ranking with Tour Championship win   (CNN) -  
Record-breaker and history-maker Jordan Spieth has reaped the rewards of becoming golf's new superstar this year -- and now the American is planning to share his riches. 

His spectacular season culminated in landing an $11.5 million jackpot on Sunday, when he regained the world No. 1 ranking by winning the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup finale. 

Spieth's four-stroke victory at the Tour Championship clinched the $10 million prize for winning the four-tournament series, and took his total earnings for 2015 past $22 million. It surpassed the record of $20.9 million set by Tiger Woods in 2007. 
 
""For me it's important to give it back to not only the people that need it, but also to our team who made it possible,"" the 22-year-old told CNN. 

""This is a bonus that isn't just for me, I promise you that. 

""This is going to a lot of various places because this season was magical and there was a lot of behind the scenes work done by a lot of people, and I want to be able to share that with them."" 

With Australian Jason Day failing to finish in the top five on Sunday, Spieth took the PGA Championship winner's place at the top of the rankings. 

The Texan was able to celebrate his incredible weekend of success with his whole family and says it was made all the more special by the presence of his autistic sister Ellie, who missed out on his previous wins. 

""It was really cool, it was great. When she came out I didn't even see her,"" he said. 

""I wasn't expecting it, she just kind of ran into me and gave me a hug. It was awesome. 

""It was special to have everybody here, it was just like the Masters except that Ellie was added in too. 

""I owe everything to my family. They're my inspiration, they're the ones who put in the sacrifice to allow me to be here so I'm able to now celebrate with them and it's going to be fun."" 

Spieth's season started with victories in the opening two majors -- the U.S. Open and the Masters -- and he fell just short of becoming the first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win the opening three when he missed out on a playoff at the British Open by one shot. 

He then tied for second at the PGA Championship, but missed the cut in the opening two FedEx Cup playoff events before bouncing back when it most mattered at East Lake. 

The Atlanta venue was the home course of golf legend Bobby Jones, the only man to win a calendar grand slam -- in 1930, when two of the majors were amateur championships. 

""It's amazing. It's almost like a major championship,"" Spieth said of the elite 30-player event. 

""What an unbelievable venue this is, the scene of a lot of Bobby Jones' history. 

""It's cool to come back here and attack this golf course and play it the right way. I didn't make it easy on myself but all in all that last walk up 18 was pretty fun.""",6d8aadb7-8085-463a-b240-fb7693ba5755,News,2015-09-28T15:31:41Z,Click2Houston.com,Jordan Spieth: Golfer sets prize money record,0.0,News

3725,"From midriff-baring fairy cocktail waitresses, to succulent goulash, to flirty burlesque acts, classical music interludes, cameos by various 19th-century artistes and a ritualized serving of absinthe (the potent green liquor dubbed “the green fairy”), the new cabaret show “Bohemia” is in a realm of its own. 
 
As veterans of Cafe Nordo shows, “Bohemia” co-creators and performers Mark Siano and Opal Peachey certainly know their way around whimsical foodie theater. (“Bohemia” is performed at Nordo’s Culinarium, in Pioneer Square .) And given their previous piece, “Seattle Vice,” they have experience evoking bygone eras with music, humor and booze. 
 
But “Seattle Vice” was set in the familiar era of the mid-1960s, amid Emerald City gangsters and crooked coppers. “Bohemia” shuttles between different periods of the 19th century, between Paris and Prague, and between such notables as Polish composer Chopin, and Czech turn-of-the-century art nouveau artist Mucha. 
  Cabaret Review  ‘Bohemia’  
By Opal Peachey and Mark Siano. Through Sept. 27, at Nordo’s Culinarium, 109 S. Main St., Seattle. Tickets are $25-$80, depending on whether cocktails and/or dinner are included; (800-838-3006 or brownpapertickets.com) 
    
The central persona in this diverting, atmospheric whimsy bubble is another famous Czech, Antonín Dvorak (Siano).

Boeing starts final assembly of its first 737 MAX Unlimited Digital Access.  $1 for 4 weeks. 
Smarting over a nasty review in a Prague newspaper for one of his compositions, and lacking inspiration for his ninth symphony, Dvorak goes on an absinthe binge. 
 
In a hallucinatory haze he communes with the ghosts of artists past and present. The lusty sprites who’ve been fetching your drinks are transformed into Dvorak’s fairy posse. They dance, do supple acrobatics with emerald silk drapes, pose suggestively. 
 
Sticklers for historical accuracy beware: the real Dvorak was a religiously pious family man, whose big indulgence was raising pigeons. And he wrote his best known work, Symphony No. 9 in E Minor (aka the New World Symphony) while living in the U.S. and (presumably) without any poetic mentoring from Frédéric Chopin (Peachey). 
 
And maybe the world-renowned actress Sarah Bernhardt (Cherry Manhattan) did perform a deliciously histrionic striptease for Mucha, as he painted her portrait. Somehow, I doubt it. 
 
So take “Bohemia” as both a freewheeling spoof of and ode to artistic romanticism. And on those grounds, it’s a beguiling, mildly naughty and well-provisioned evening. 
 
The cast is impressive, with all doing double (or triple) duty. Beside scripting, Siano and Peachey ably composed the music that isn’t by Chopin, Dvorak and Debussy, including a robust drinking song (“Nazdravi”). 
  
Favorite number: the clever “My Girl George.” In man’s suit and top hat, Peachey’s saucy Chopin duets with his cross-dressing (real-life) lover, novelist George Sand (Annastasia Workman). Then the fairies turn up in male garb to waltz along. 
 
Peachey and Siano are both proficient pianists and singers, and other instrumentalists pitch in. You marvel at the quick-change efficiency of the fluttering fairies. (Don’t forget to tip them.) And some of the costumes, by Montana Tippett with others, are resplendent. 
 
It’s a lengthy show, with space for appetizers, drinks and goulash. And it could do with better jokes about Bohemia the place vs. bohemians, and rather less blather about art with a capitol “A” and inspiration with a capitol “I.” 
 
As for the absinthe, do partake in the ritual if you can handle the ultra-intense taste of anise and the 136 proof kick. (You can also sip it in a less ferocious cocktail.) 
   
Any production that has an absinthe consultant gets a badge for uniqueness. As the Czech toast goes, “Na zdravi!”",b7bb9e6f-c6b3-4bb8-9ac6-c215842243bd,News,2015-09-16T18:10:01Z,Seattle Times,"‘Bohemia’: Antonín Dvorak like you’ve never seen him, at Cafe Nordo’s Culinarium Updated 4:40 pm",0.0,Blog

639,"(CNN) – For the past decade, we’ve drilled into children that when they ride a bike, they need to wear a helmet. Now scientists say it may be too late: Tricycle riders should be wearing them, too. 

Think this is a case of safety overkill? Authors of a new study published in the journal Pediatrics say the answer is in the numbers. 

According to their estimates, there were 9,340 cases of tricycle-related accidents that sent children to emergency rooms in 2012 and 2013. The most common body part injured: a child’s head — and head injuries can cause lasting damage. 

Co-author Sean Bandzar, a medical student at the Medical College of Georgia, said he noticed a few of his small patients coming in with lacerations to the face after riding trikes. He wanted to know more about the injuries and did a medical literature search, but most of the research was limited or outdated, he said. 

Using data collected from 100 emergency rooms for the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, researchers found that boys are more likely than girls to turn up in the emergency room. Two-year-olds seem to have the most accidents, although there were tricycle injuries for children up to age 7. The most common broken bone was the elbow and the most common injury overall was a cut to the face. 

In addition to helmets, the authors suggest kids wear elbow pads, and that parents supervise their children while they ride. 

“We really feel strongly that the child should be able to ride in an environment free of hazards,” Bandzar said. “Have them ride away from the street and away from water.” 

The good news is the majority of children sent to the ER after trike accidents are treated and released. Only 224 of the more than 9,000 injured were admitted to the hospital. Deaths have increased, but not at a statistically significant rate, according to an earlier study. 

Knowing the types of injuries tykes on trikes may experience should help doctors make safety equipment recommendations. 

As an emergency room doctor in Ohio, Dr. Gary Smith has seen his share of tricycle accident patients over the years. He thinks the study is a good start, although he cautions about drawing significant conclusions from two years of data, which he considers narrow. Smith, the president of the Child Injury Prevention Alliance, has worked with similar data and said he’d love to see expanded research. 

Smith said he doesn’t recommend elbow pads, but helmets are a must for his own children any time they take a ride. When parents ask for advice, he tells them it’s their choice, but he has three suggestions: “Wear a helmet, wear a helmet, wear a helmet,” Smith said. 

His organization has done crash tests with tricycles. Injuries from falls can be significant. “Concrete is unforgiving and it doesn’t take a fall from very high to cause a serious transfer of energy. We’ve even seen a child die after a fall on concrete from only 4 feet up,” he said. “These injuries are not always this serious. I’ve also seen children come in with bruises, bumps and slight concussions, but I don’t want to take that chance with my own child.” 

The authors of the study in Pediatrics suggest manufacturers consider a couple of design changes to help make tricycles safer. An earlier study found that most accidents happen when a child turns the handlebars too fast and tips over or falls. Most children don’t have the depth perception or coordination yet to catch themselves or to fall without injury. Limiting the turning radius of a trike may prevent these accidents. A device that limits the maximum speed may also help, especially for children living on or riding near hills. Most tricycles don’t have brakes. 

Overall, Smith and the authors think riding tricycles is a good experience for children. There are even benefits to falling, with the right equipment. 

“I think it is important to keep children safe enough, but not as safe as possible,” Smith said. “I think we need to build resilience in children. They learn by pushing their limits and getting up after falling and dusting themselves off again. 

“Plus it’s important for parents to do their part to keep kids off the couch and active and not keep them in bubble wrap. We need to find that sweet spot to make sure kids are challenging themselves, but also making sure they don’t pay the price with a traumatic brain injury.”",6177ebc1-8420-4b11-b7e6-f2c6c1dde6e1,News,2015-09-14T19:52:29Z,KFRU-AM,"Even children on tricycles should wear helmets, researchers say",0.0,News
4936,"Here’s a look at the Raiders’ current 53-man roster. It’s always a fluid situation, especially with some areas that could use an upgrade (secondary, backup offensive line being the biggest needs).  

 Quarterbacks  Derek Carr, Matt McGloin: McGloin beat out Christian Ponder to serve as the backup and the Raiders have too many other needs elsewhere to have three QBs. If the Raiders have to go beyond these two, they’re in trouble already and Ponder or someone else out there of his caliber would probably be available.   Running backs  Latavius Murray, Roy Helu Jr., Taiwan Jones: Murray’s the lead back, Helu’s the third-down back, Jones is the change of pace and probably handle kick returns.   Fullbacks  Marcel Reece, Jamize Olawale: Reece also provides protection at tailback and Olawale is the true fullback and has special teams value.   Wide receivers  Amari Cooper, Michael Crabtree, Rod Streater, Andre Holmes, Brice Butler, Seth Roberts: Cooper and Crabtree are your starters. Who’s the No. 3? Still up in the air. Holmes is coming back from a broken hand and Butler and Roberts have looked good. Streater is still getting back up to speed. Any way it’s sliced, this group is solid and has great depth.   Tight ends  Lee Smith, Mychal Rivera, Clive Walford, Gabe Holmes: Didn’t expect the Raiders to keep four, which might not be a great sign about Walford’s health.   Offensive line  Donald Penn, Gabe Jackson, Rodney Hudson, J’Marcus Webb, Austin Howard, Khalif Barnes, Jon Feliciano, Matt McCants, Tony Bergstrom: Bergstrom may have been a surprise, but not so much when you consider he played the whole game Thursday at center. Feliciano can play there, but doesn’t look like the Raiders think he’s ready. McCants had an awful final preseason game, but had been pretty good before then.    Defensive line  Khalil Mack, Justin Tuck, Dan Williams, Justin Ellis, Denico Autry, Benson Mayowa, Mario Edwards Jr., Stacy McGee: The Raiders still list Mack at LB, but that’s not fooling anybody. A guy like Autry may not start, but he can be impactful. Mayowa is a good depth guy who is gaining experience playing SAM linebacker too. Edwards has a chance to develop into a good pass rusher.   Linebackers  Curtis Lofton, Ray-Ray Armstrong, Malcolm Smith, Lorenzo Alexander, Ben Heeney, Neiron Ball: Not a group to get wildly excited about. Could be another area to try to upgrade.   Cornerbacks  TJ Carrie, DJ Hayden, Keith McGill, Neiko Thorpe, Dexter McDonald, SaQuan Edward, Chimdi Chekwa: The fact that none of the other five CBs on the roster have provided a serious threat to supplant Hayden tells you what you need to know. Help is needed here.   Safeties  Charles Woodson, Nate Allen, Larry Asante: Anybody really think the Raiders go into the season with just three safeties?   Specialists  K Sebastian Janikowski, P Marquette King, LS Jon Condo: Solid group there. No return specialists, meaning for now it’s probably Taiwan Jones and TJ Carrie.",17feb952-5450-44a7-b681-9d1d3706ce91,Blog,2015-09-06T01:44:24Z,Inside the Oakland Raiders,Quick look at the Raiders’ 53-man roster,1.0,Blog

Eliminator is really fun.  You pick one team each week that you think is going to win.  If that team wins you move on to the next week.  If they lose you are eliminated.  What makes it even more interesting is that once you pick a team you cannot pick them again for the rest of the season.

We are a little bit late getting this started.  You need to be in before the Steelers and Patriots game kicks off tonight.  We will come up with something cool to do for the winner of both leagues.",403f647c-a9d0-4bde-85b7-70efa0f04867,Blog,2015-09-10T17:00:03Z,Music City Miracles -  All Posts,"Play FanDuel, Eliminator, and Pick'em with MCM!",1.0,Blog

2104,"The Department of Special Investigation (DSI) appears to be in the hot seat after the Supreme Court's Criminal Division for Political Office-Holders handed down its verdict on Aug 26 in the Krungthai Bank (KTB) case. 
 
The long drawn-out case involved the granting of 9.9 billion baht in loans to subsidiaries of real estate company Krisdamahanakorn (KMN) under the government of Thaksin Shinawatra. 
  
Nineteen executives of the bank (including then president Viroj Nualkhair and chairman Suchai Jaovisidha) and Krisdamahanakorn affiliates were sentenced to heavy jail terms ranging from 12 to 18 years. 
 
Thaksin, charged as the first defendant in this case, was not convicted by the court because he ran away before the trial started in 2012. The case against him was suspended and an arrest warrant issued by the court. 
 
Immediately after the verdict was announced, a big question was raised by those who had followed this loan scandal about four other figures who allegedly received a windfall from the loans but who were spared prosecution by the Office of the Attorney-General (OAG). 
 
The four individuals are Thaksin's son Panthongtae; Kanchana Honghern, the personal secretary of Khunying Potjamarn, Thaksin's ex-wife; Wanchai Honghern, Mrs Kanchana's husband; and Manop Thivaree, father of Sitha, a former executive of the disbanded Thai Rak Thai Party. They were implicated in the loan scandal by the Assets Scrutiny Committee (ASC) which was set up by the junta after the 2006 coup to investigate shady or unusual deals endorsed by Thaksin, or which had his consent. 
 
The ASC recommended the four individuals be charged with receiving stolen property in accordance with Article 357 of the Criminal Code and with violating the anti-money laundering law. 
 
The question is, why were the stolen property charges against the four dropped? Who buried the charges? Why did it not proceed? 
 
Former ASC spokesman Kaewsan Atibodhi helped shed light on the stolen property case. He said an investigation of the money trail for the 9.9 billion baht loan showed Mr Panthongtae received 17 million baht from Ratchada Krisdathanont, an executive of Krisdamahanakorn who was jailed for 12 years by the Supreme Court, and another 105 million baht was given to the other three figures by the company. 
 
Mr Kaewsan said the ASC decided not to charge Mr Panthongtae and the other three for involvement in the loan scandal but recommended instead they be charged with receiving stolen property and violation of anti-money laundering laws. 
 
In testifying to the ASC, Mr Panthongtae said the cheque he received was an investment from Ratchada for a joint venture project they were working on. 
 
All the case files covering every charge and individual implicated, including the stolen property case, were handed over to the DSI by the ASC eight years ago. But only the shady loan case against Thaksin and the then executives of KTB and KMN was sent to the Supreme Court by the OAG. 
 
Here is the clarification from the OAG about why it did not take the stolen property case to court. A press conference was held at the OAG's office on Aug 31 to clear the air about the case by Vinai Damrongmongkolkul, an inspector-general who was in charge of the overall investigation. 
 
To sum up, the OAG said Mr Panthongtae and the other three were not state officials or assistants to state officials, so neither the National Anti-Corruption Commission nor the ASC had the authority to investigate them from the beginning. 
 
The OAG also said the case should have been put in the hands of the police like any normal criminal case. 
 
Mr Vinai said the case was being handled by the DSI. But the DSI had sat on it for all these years. Since the DSI accepted the case in 2008, there had been no word about it from its department heads -- Pol Col Thawee Sodsong, Tarit Pengdit, Pol Gen Chatchaval Sooksomchit and the incumbent Suwana Suwanchutha. 
 
That was probably why Justice Minister Gen Paiboon Kumchaya appeared annoyed when he was asked last week about the progress -- or the lack of it. 
 
The DSI has called a meeting today to discuss the case and expects to come up with a decision within a month. That means eight years have now elapsed without the DSI having done anything about the case. 
 
Meanwhile, there is another worry -- that of the statute of limitations of the case. The alleged offences occurred in 2004 and now it is 2015. Has the statute of limitations already expired? 
 
Looking back at this whole disgraceful saga, I see several victims among those who deserve punishment by the court. 
 
They are the ones who simply took orders from the ""boss"" and who did not receive any financial gain from the loan deal. Ironically, Mr Panthongtae might possibly be one of those dragged -- willingly or unwillingly -- into this shady deal which finally backfired.

Meteorologists are split over whether Hurricane Joaquin will slam the East Coast.  Joaquin is now pushing through the Atlantic Ocean just southeast of Florida, and some models have it hitting the mid-Atlantic region by Sunday.  
 
The storm bulked up to hurricane status early this morning and could possibly grow up to a Category Three storm with winds topping 110 miles-per-hour.  Forecasters are predicting heavy rain all the way from North Carolina to Maine in the coming days as they keep an eye on the storm.

Victory is rising and the world has turned insane
Sleeping dogs are waking and the little children pray
Dying suns are setting in a sky of raging war
We think about the good times while we perish with before
""I bring you lies, I bring with me
A dream that only, we can see
I bring eyes; I bring you teeth
I have a dream, reserved for me""
Victory is rising with the advent of the tide
Broken men are crying while they stagger in the night
Storm clouds are ascending where the falling stars collide
Walking through the fires to the sound of life that dies

2536,"Tyson Fury said he feels for his supporters after his world heavyweight title challenge to Wladimir Klitschko was postponed due to the Ukrainian sustaining a calf injury in training. 
 
		 
Fury had been due to face Klitschko in Dusseldorf on October 24 but the bout will have to be re-scheduled following the announcement by Klitschko on Friday. 
  Tyson Fury's world title challenge to Wladimir Klitschko has been postponed.   
It is the latest misfortune to befall Fury after two bouts against David Haye were postponed in 2013, and a domestic meeting with Dereck Chisora was also delayed last year. 

			 
Fury told Sky Sports: ""All my supporters and fans - they always lose out. 



 
""It's all right for us - we're in training camps, we get our expenses back, but what about all the people who have travelled and paid money for the tickets. 

""Things are hard. People are doing this because they're showing support, because some of my fans can't afford to go really, but they pushed the boat out because it's a massive occasion, a once-in-a-lifetime thing. 

""I'm wounded for all these people and this happens too much in boxing, and it's not the fighters that pay for it, it's the fans. We get our bits and pieces back - they don't."" 

Klitschko's announcement comes just two days after Fury dressed as Batman and wrestled a man dressed as The Joker during a press conference to promote the fight in London. 

			 
Klitschko said he would aim to recover ""as fast as possible"" so that the contest can be re-arranged, with a new date expected as early as next week. 

Klitschko said: ""Especially after the exciting press conference last Wednesday, I was looking forward to this fight very much. I know that a lot of fans have already organised their trips to support me in Dusseldorf. 

""I am so sorry that I am not able to fight on October 24. I also apologise to my opponent, who has spent many weeks preparing for this fight. I will do my very best to recover as fast as possible."" 

Klitschko sustained the injury during a training session on Wednesday and a subsequent MRI scan revealed a partial musculotendinous tear of the left calf. 

			 
Klitschko's manager Bernd Boente told the German newspaper Bild:  ""Next week we will make it known when the fight will be re-staged. 

""We will definitely remain in Dusseldorf. The tickets which have already been sold will remain valid.""

 Jim Carrey was a huge support to girlfriend Cathriona White when they first got together as she was grieving the loss of her father. 
 
The Hollywood star and aspiring actress started dating in 2012 and the new couple were seen on holiday together around the time she flew back to her native Ireland for her dad's funeral. 
 
A source exclusively told Mirror Celeb: ""Her father suffered from a long-term illness and Jim was Cathriona's rock when he passed away."" 
 
The 53-year-old star has now been left heartbroken, along with her family, after she took her own life. 
 
 Cathriona White, Jim Carrey May 18, 2015 
 
The couple first met in late summer 2012, but by March the following year they had split. 
 
They kept in constant touch as friends before rekindling their romance in May this year and split just days before Cathriona was found dead . 
 
Our source continued: ""Cathriona's family are fiercely protective, as are the people in Cappaghwhite, the small village where she is from, and everyone was extremely proud of her. They are normal country people. 
 
""Cathriona had been mad about Jim since she met him and was thrilled when they got back together earlier this year.

""Jim loves Ireland and loved Tipperary, showing his support for it recently by wearing the local hurling jersey."" 
 
It is thought they made a secret trip to Ireland to meet her family earlier this year and they recently visited Canada together. 
 
""Cathriona and Jim were both into the outdoors and keeping fit,"" our source added. 
 
""They cycled and mountain climbed together and she spent most of her time at his house.

""They were really into healthy eating – she wasn't much of a party girl and was happy to live a low key life with Jim out of the limelight, something he also wanted."" 
 
Cathriona, 28, doted on her nephews and nieces in Tipperary and missed them terribly while away in Los Angeles, trying to get back home as often as possible. 
 
Seven weeks ago, Cathriona's older sister Lisa and her husband John Aherne had travelled out to Los Angeles to spend some time with her. 
 
Her funeral is expected to take place in her native Tipperary once arrangements are made.

PLANNING for a bypass road around Batemans Bay, from the Princes Highway to Surf Beach, began, perhaps, 30 years ago.

When the Batemans Bay bypass is eventually completed, traffic density in the Batemans Bay CBD is predicted to lessen significantly.

The problem is that no-one seems to be able to say when the bypass road (or spine road) will be completed, the state government being the current hold-up.

Surely the Minister for Transport can use some influence with RMS to sort out funding for this connection and make it a properly funded priority, and forget about the boundary change and amalgamation idea that will prove to be a financial liability on the shire’s

residents if it ever were to proceed.

ST. LOUIS , Sept. 18, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Attorneys from the Houston and Kansas City offices of the Potts Law Firm, LLP , have filed a new lawsuit against auto manufacturing giant General Motors LLC (NYSE: GM) in St. Louis City Circuit Court on behalf of 90 individual victims of a deadly ignition switch defect that led to the recall of more than 28 million GM vehicles worldwide and has caused more than 120 deaths and thousands of injuries. 

The new claims for serious injuries and wrongful death follow this week's announcement that GM will pay a $900 million criminal settlement as part of a deferred prosecution agreement with U.S. Department of Justice for misleading the government and the public about the company's handling of the faulty ignition switches. 

The Potts Law Firm represents hundreds of individuals and their families in lawsuits against GM in Missouri courts and other jurisdictions across the U.S. The new claims filed in St. Louis allege that the GM ignition switches caused vehicles to shut off while being driven, prevented protective airbags from inflating, and caused seatbelts to malfunction. The new filing is Patricia Foreman , et al. v. General Motors LLC . Overall, the firm represents nearly 150 ignition switch victims in St. Louis . 

Accomplished trial attorney and Potts Law Firm Managing Partner Derek Potts represents the families of Tabatha Rogers , 26, and Tara Yates , 27, who died in 2014 when their car unexpectedly careened off a level stretch of highway. Their case is tentatively set for trial in January 2016 in St. Louis . 

Ms. Rogers lost control of her 2001 Pontiac Grand Am on the day after Valentine's Day on old State Highway 35 in Sevier County, Tennessee . The car hit an embankment before becoming airborne and striking a utility pole. Ms. Rogers died at the scene and Ms. Yates died shortly after at a nearby hospital. Mr. Potts says he plans to prove that a faulty GM ignition switch caused the fatal crash. 

""We believe the evidence clearly shows that these young women would still be here today if not for an ignition switch that General Motors knew was defective,"" says Mr. Potts. ""It is extremely telling that airbags in their car didn't inflate at any point despite this violent, fatal wreck."" 

The Houston -based Potts Law Firm represents clients in a variety of personal injury claims and mass tort matters, from complex pharmaceutical cases to automobile defect cases to product liability claims. The firm currently is accepting new GM ignition switch cases and referrals. Visit www.potts-law.com   for more information.

5940,"For folks who like spirited riding on snazzy sport-touring motorcycles, there are Mecca-like roads – a few of them – scattered throughout the world.  In California one might be State Route 36 from Red Bluff to the coast.  In Wyoming and Montana, folks will consider Beartooth Pass.  There’s the Tail of the Dragon back east.    But the granddaddy of ‘em all is found in the Italian Alps: Stelvio Pass.  Rising 6,138 feet through 75 hairpin turns, the British automotive show Top Gear pegs it as “the greatest driving road in the world.”  It may or may not remain unchecked on my bucket list. The summer of 2015 has found me taking a forced hiatus from riding due to a condition called Dupuytren’s Contracture.   In older men of northern European extraction (I have to cop to at least two of these three characteristics), oft times the fascia which overlays and protects the tendons which allow the fingers to flex and/or straighten, shrinks up – contracts – disallowing the tendons to do their job.  In my case, the crook in my right pinkie made it impossible to put on riding gloves.  ATGATT: No Gloves = No Ride. Repair for this malady involves removal of a section of the uncooperative fascia. A very worthy surgeon at my local Kaiser undertook this operation.  When I awoke from anesthesia, my throttle hand was casted and wrapped.  It would remain so for two weeks.  I guess I can go without riding for two weeks, I thought to myself. Those fourteen days dragged by and when the wraps came off, it turns out that my expectations had been a little vigorous.  It would be at least another two (more than likely four) weeks until my palm fully knitted and I could competently and safely operate a motorcycle. To add a tiny bit of insult to this injury, it seems the incision necessary for removing the fascia has to be of a zigzag design so as to protect the route of the still working tendon.  I’ve been told to remove the dressing daily to inspect and clean the thing, which I do.  On one of these routine inspections, it struck me:  My surgeon had carved a map of that glorious Italian road right into the palm of my hand! Thanks Doc!  When I do get over there, I’ll not need GPS to find my way across Stelvio Pass.  But I will have to slip off those gloves. © 2015 Church of the Open Road Press",df915a66-885a-41de-8df7-5662f1690aaf,Blog,2015-08-31T18:40:45Z,The Church of the Open Road Press,STELVIO PASS IN THE PALM OF MY HAND,1.0,Blog

3880,"(CNN) – Donald Trump has torn through his Republican presidential opponents, but now he has a new nemesis: Miss Alabama. 

Meg McGuffin finished as the “fourth runner up” in the Miss America 2016 pageant on Sunday night. 

But it was her shot at Trump — who she said should leave the GOP “absolutely terrified” — that provided the most memorable moment of her pageant appearance. 

During the competition, Miss America judge Taya Kyle, the widow of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, asked McGuffin to weigh in on Trump’s surge to the front of the Republican presidential pack. 

“I think Donald Trump is an entertainer, and I think he says what’s on a lot of peoples’ minds,” she said. 

“But I think the Republican Party should be absolutely terrified of all the attention that he is taking from incredible candidates like Jeb Bush and Chris Christie who could absolutely do the job of president of the United States.” 

McGuffin’s assessment of Trump as an “entertainer” isn’t far out of line with what some of Trump’s rivals — and even the real estate mogul himself — have said recently. 

Last week, Trump defended comments about GOP contender Carly Fiorina’s face by saying that “some comments are made as an entertainer.” 

Other Republicans, including Bush, Christie, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, have complained that Trump is sucking up too much oxygen, leaving the rest of the party’s field of candidates largely ignored.",1210e9f5-8c2d-49f8-94d5-e57e1369355c,News,2015-09-14T11:33:18Z,KCMO Talk Radio,Miss Alabama: GOP should be ‘absolutely terrified’ of Trump,0.0,News
2994,"Three Illinois schools were evacuated Wednesday morning after higher than normal levels of Legionella bacteria was found during routine air quality testing. 

The bacteria were detected in the cooling towers of the schools’ HVAC systems, according to WGN and NBC Chicago . 

>> Read more trending stories 

The school district posted a message on its Facebook page, explaining the decision to evacuate the schools immediately. 

According to the CDC , Legionella is a bacteria found naturally in the environment, especially in warm water systems. The bacteria can be inhaled via contaminated air.  It is not transmitted from person to person. Legionella can cause a form of bacterial pneumonia known as Legionnaires’ disease. Most cases are treatable with antibiotics. Those who have compromised immune systems and the elderly are at the most risk for complications. 

Legionella can also cause a flu-like disease called Pontiac fever, which is milder in nature. 

According to the CBS Chicago , no reports of illness so far have been reported at the three schools that were evacuated. ",bb1f9d79-79b6-4e0f-a903-d99b1ca22f9e,News,2015-09-23T17:59:43Z,WHIO TV,3 schools evacuated after Legionella bacteria found,0.0,Blog

Employment in the state’s second-largest sector, industrial machinery, also posted a gain, up 6.7% to its current level of 23,049 jobs.

312,"A Beverley businessman is about to set off on a 720km bike ride across France to raise funds to fight the disease which claimed the life of his sister. 

		 
Rob Davies, director of Yourlink Ltd, on Annie Reed Industrial Estate, will cycle across the Pyrenees from Biaritz to Argeles-sur-mer in order to raise cash for research into leukaemia and  lymphoma. 

Describing himself as “a complete novice” when it comes to cycling, he has set himself a time limit of just six days for the journey in which he will ride uphill to a height of 13,000 metres. 

			 
His late sister Alison Elliott was a top make-up artist in the film industry who died aged 47 just one week after being diagnosed with a rare form of leukaemia, and two weeks before her twins’ first birthday. 



 
Rob said: “Alison was a loving friend, sister, daughter, mother and wife, and I wanted to try and do something epic to raise money. 

“She was a very well-known and respected make-up designer having worked with many film stars from the likes of Emma Thompson to Michael Douglas. The film Nanny McPhee II was dedicated to her name.” 

Rob’s trip will take him from the Atlantic coast to the Mediterranean coast. 

But he won’t be alone because he’ll be accompanied on by  the trip by work colleague Patrick Konrath, also a novice cyclist. 

			 
Rob added: “We’ve been training for the past six months at Beverley Leisure centre and on local roads.  Our aim is to raise as much money as possible to help fund research towards this great cause, that affects around 30,000 people per year in the UK. 

“Our company is funding the cost of all equipment and travel expenses running in to well over £5,000, and all donations  will go directly to the charity. 

“The challenge represents a huge one in more ways than one, and has required at least  nine months of training up to 70 miles per day. 

“It will culminate in us climbing some of the largest peaks in the world, including many of the infamous climbs seen on television in the Tour de France.” Rob’s target is to  raise £5000.

1765,"After four days of intense competition, the Army has named its 2015 Drill Sergeants and AIT Platoon Sergeant of the Year. Staff Sgt. Jacob Miller of Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, is this year's Drill Sergeant of the Year. Staff Sgt. Mark Mercer is the Army Reserve Drill Sergeant of the Year. Mercer is assigned to the 95th Division, 108th Training Command. This year's Advanced Individual Training Platoon Sergeant of the Year is Sgt. 1st Class Samuel Enriquez of Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, Texas. All three soldiers were recognized Thursday evening at an awards ceremony at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. Each received the Meritorious Service Medal. The Drill Sergeant and AIT Platoon Sergeant of the Year event is a four-day, ""best-of-the-best"" contest that puts competitors through physical and mental tests, according to information from the Army. Competitors must battle fatigue, weather and surprise events to earn the coveted titles. They must perform and instruct more than 50 tasks and drills including unknown distance runs and foot marches, rappelling, orienteering, obstacle courses, physical readiness training and appearances before a board of command sergeants major to demonstrate their knowledge of leadership and training tasks. While the Drill Sergeant and AIT Platoon Sergeant competition is similar to other competitions across the Army, this event focuses on competitors' ability to teach, as their day-to-day job requires them to effectively teach the Army's newest soldiers. This year, four active-duty and two Army Reserve drill sergeants competed for the Drill Sergeant of the Year title. Eight AIT platoon sergeants competed this year. All were competition winners at their respective installations or Army Reserve divisions. A closer look at this year's winners: •  Staff Sgt. Jacob Miller As Drill Sergeant of the Year, Miller will be moving to Fort Eustis, Virginia, where he will work at the Center for Initial Military Training. There, he’ll have a chance to provide input and help shape the way the Army trains new soldiers. Miller, 30, joined the Army in November 2006. He completed military police one station unit training at Fort Leonard Wood in April 2007 and has served in MP units at Fort Carson, Colorado, Fort Wainwright, Alaska, and Fort Leonard Wood. Miller, who is working on his bachelor’s degree in criminal justice, has deployed twice to Iraq. His awards and decorations include an Army Commendation Medal with Valor, the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, the Iraq Campaign Medal, and the Combat Action Badge. Miller, who has been a drill sergeant since March 2013, was in disbelief that he won. “It’s unreal,” he said. ‘It was definitely a long competition, a long week of hard, intense training.” Page 2 of 3 - To prepare for the competition, Miller trained hard, including lots of foot marches, long-distance running and sprints. He also studied up on Army drill and ceremony and all the other tasks soldiers must know. “This competition was very intensive,” Miller said. “Everybody that came here were all winners. Going up against the top of the top here was just unreal.” At the same time, the soldiers shared a common camaraderie, Miller said. “We all came together, we helped each other out, pushed each other,” he said. His advice for those looking ahead to next year’s competition: “Prepare for anything. You need to be fully well rounded when you come here.” •  Staff Sgt. Mark Mercer Mercer joined the Army in July 2002, training as an X-ray technologist. He has served primarily in Oklahoma and has deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Mercer is a graduate of the University of Oklahoma, with a degree in administrative leadership. His awards and decorations include the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, and the Afghanistan Campaign Medal. The 31-year-old said he was “relieved, excited” when he learned he had won. “Just so many emotions wrapped up in my body right now,” he said. “I don’t know if I’m in shock still or what’s going on. It shows that hard work pays off.” Mercer started training for the competition in October. In addition to the physical training, Mercer spent three hours every night studying every Army regulation, field manual and publication he could find. “My wife’s glad this is over because we can spend time together now,” he said. “It was very long, strenuous, and I may have trained too hard physically in the end, but I got where I needed to be. Determination and adrenaline go a long way.” Mercer said he’s glad for the experience. “I’ve made some good friends here, met a lot of great people, a lot of knowledgeable people,” he said. “It was an honor to compete against and alongside every single person that was here this week.” • Sgt. 1st Class Samuel Enriquez Enriquez, 30, is a combat medic who joined the Army in August 2002. Before his assignment as an AIT platoon sergeant at Fort Sam Houston, Enriquez served multiple tours with the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and has served in Germany and South Korea. His awards and decorations include the Meritorious Service Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Expert Field Medical Badge, the Senior Parachutist Badge and the Air Assault Badge. Page 3 of 3 - Winning the competition “still seems surreal,” he said. “I’m still soaking it in.” Enriquez, who has been an AIT platoon sergeant since January, also will be moving to the Center for Initial Military Training. “I’m part of something bigger now,” he said. “I’m part of a different level of the Army where I can make huge changes. Before, I loved it, and I could always make change, but it was more incremental. Here I can help make gigantic changes that could shape the future of the Army.” In his new assignment, Enriquez will be responsible for providing input that will shape the initial entry process, whether it’s basic training or AIT. “It’s a pretty grand thing, just thinking about the fact that you’re changing the way the Army trains its soldiers,” he said. “I never thought I’d be in this position.”",e7ea7dd7-0266-431a-bfb4-c8e88532c0d4,News,2015-09-12T16:38:05Z,Waynesville Daily Guide,"Drill Sergeant, AIT Platoon Sergeant of the Year named 10:44 am",0.0,Blog

HOUSTON, TX -- (Marketwired) -- 09/10/15 -- Heritage Texas Properties (Heritage), the largest independently owned residential real estate firm in the Greater Houston region, names Chaille Ralph, last year's Chair of the Houston Association of Realtors®, as its new President. 

Mrs. Robin Mueck, owner and CEO of one of Houston's most recognized and honored real estate brokerages, becomes Chairman and CEO to lead the firm's business development and local community outreach efforts. Jerry Mueck, Executive Vice President and husband of Robin, is also an owner. 

""Our people are our greatest strength,"" says Mueck, ""and we now have in place a vibrant new management team -- led by an admired and proven leader, Chaille Ralph. Our leadership team has a shared vision to provide exciting new growth and innovation that will deliver even greater geographic reach, and inspired personal service to delight our clients."" 

 Heritage , which will celebrate its 40th Anniversary next year, has grown under Mueck's leadership from a few dozen agents in one office to 16 locations from the Gulf Coast to Central Texas, home to more than 300 licensed Realtors. It has been recognized as one of the top brokerage firms in the U.S. by REAL Trends. As a member of the prestigious Leading Real Estate Companies of the World and Luxury Portfolio, and a past recipient of its Most Innovative Brokerage Award, Heritage also is part of a global marketing network of 500+ real estate firms with 3,500 offices and 120,000 sales associates spanning 50 countries. This exclusive partnership allows Heritage to promote its properties to potential buyers all over the world. 

Ms. Ralph, a licensed real estate broker since 1982, has been with Heritage since 2009, most recently as Senior Vice President of Sales for the company's Post Oak, Downtown and Galveston locations. A respected industry leader, she serves as a Director of the National Association of Realtors, the Texas Association of Realtors and the Houston Association of Realtors. She's a native Houstonian, alumnae of St. Thomas Episcopal School, and graduated from Texas Christian University with a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration. 

Ms. Ralph will lead the day-to-day operations, heading the new leadership team for Heritage . In related moves, Sandy Benson, Senior Vice President, is now responsible for sales companywide, supporting top line growth and overseeing branch leaders. Kristen Abney, Senior Vice President, heads up the highly profitable relocation division as well as strategic initiatives and special projects. Senior Vice President Bill Jones has been selected to head up an exciting new venture that Heritage will reveal in the coming weeks. 
  
""This may be the most exciting time in our company's treasured journey,"" says Mrs. Mueck. ""I am honored and humbled to help Chaille and our management team write our next chapter of success. We are the company to watch."" Mrs. Mueck believes that her burgeoning enterprise will continue to expand, as it attracts the best talent from both the ""Next Gen"" and seasoned veterans. 

""While these innovative moves create an energy and excitement among the Heritage family that will help us grow and serve our clients better than ever,"" Mrs. Mueck adds, ""Our traditional values remain unchanged: We have built our culture around attracting people of integrity who genuinely care and have concern for our clients and each other, which is rare. We do it right. That won't change."" 

Mrs. Mueck, as Chairman and CEO, will be focusing on expanding Heritage market share throughout the communities it serves, both through business development and taking a more direct role in local community leadership activities throughout the Greater Houston Region. ""I'm thrilled to transition Chaille to lead the day-to-day operations to allow me to focus on exciting new growth initiatives and deepen our long-standing relationship with the community."" 

Mrs. Mueck notes that Ms. Ralph's appointment to President is the third major initiative Heritage has undertaken in recent months. In June, the company unveiled its new logo and brand identity. The effort, says VP of Marketing Jaclyn Reed who spearheaded the effort, was designed to ""visually align our brand with the modern company Heritage has become, yet underscore our long-standing image of quality, service and sophistication based on our tradition of excellence and integrity."" 

Second, Heritage is renovating its flagship Post Oak Park office, which reopens on October 1, 2015. ""It's a complete overhaul of the entire 12th floor of this Class A office building,"" Mrs. Mueck says, ""and it symbolizes our penchant for quality in everything we do."" 

With 360-degree sweeping views of the downtown Houston skyline, River Oaks, Uptown Park, the Galleria and 1,500-acre canopy of Memorial Park, Ralph, Mueck and the rest of the leadership team will have created a stellar environment for its agents, staff and clients. ""This expansion will enable increased marketing support,"" says Mrs. Mueck, including marketing for builders, development support, and personal branding for agents. ""Our flagship office paints a new picture of innovation and progress, still suitable for our established traditions,"" she adds. The location will be used for state-of-the-art corporate video production, video conferencing, and distance learning to support Heritage Texas Properties located throughout the state. 

 Heritage Texas Properties has a legacy of leadership that includes five former Chairs of the Houston Association of Realtors, with four still part of the Heritage Texas Properties team, including Mrs. Mueck, Ms. Ralph, Mr. Jones and Lynn Zarr, Sr.

3429,"The Raiders signed free agent LB Lorenzo Alexander, the club announced Wednesday. 
 
Alexander is entering his ninth NFL season, following stints with the Washington Redskins (2006-12) and Arizona Cardinals (2013-14), and practice squad stops with the Carolina Panthers (2005) and Baltimore Ravens (2006). For his career, Alexander has totaled 111 games played with 16 starts, 154 tackles (95 solo), nine sacks, three forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries and six passes defensed. A standout special teams performer, he has also recorded 94 special teams stops over his career. 
 
The 6-foot-1, 245-pounder was voted as the NFC’s special teams representative for the Pro Bowl after he posted 31 special teams tackles in 2012. On defense that season, Alexander added a career-high 2.5 sacks and 26 tackles (17 solo). 
 
Off the field, Alexander was named Washington's Walter Payton Man of the Year Award nominee twice (2010-11) during his tenure with the team. He was also named as the recipient of Washington’s Media Good Guy award in both 2011 and 2012. 
 
A native of Berkeley, Calif., Alexander attended California, where he was a two-time honorable mention All-Pac 10 selection as a defensive lineman. 
 
To make room on the roster, the Raiders have waived LB Horace Miller.

Young people gather at the Redgranite Quarry, a popular summer swimming destination. ?You can?t climb trees. You can?t put up ropes,? Redgranite Fire Chief Jim Angelo said of efforts to keep the quarry safe.

The Redgranite Village Board resolved Tuesday to keep Redgranite Quarry Park open after discussing the matter at a special meeting prompted by recent calls to close the park after three people died there this summer. 

After emerging from closed session, board members said the quarry would remain open, with increased fines for violations and more signs warning of the danger of swimming in the quarry. The board did not vote to keep the quarry open, but will decide on specific measures at a future meeting. 

“The city has committed to keeping this open for people to swim in,” said board member Paul Wertz. 

The village went into closed session for nearly an hour, citing protection from an exemption in Wisconsin Open Meetings law that allows municipalities to meet to discuss ongoing or likely lawsuits. 

Personal Injury Attorney Mike Siddall of Fox Valley firm Herring Clark has requested police reports and other documents related to the death of Alaya HauChee Lo, who drowned at the quarry in June. Siddall did not return messages seeking comment Tuesday. Wertz said the board isn’t aware of any litigation in progress. 

Board President Jerry Sieg said a committee will be created next spring to draft safety measures such as new signs, Facebook calls for safety and a beefed-up police presence. 

Sieg said the board took into account requests from Redgranite residents, who want the quarry to remain open. 

“People enjoy it and the majority of people that live in Redgranite are for it,” Sieg said. “And we kind of go by our constituents.” 

About 20 people attended a village board meeting Sept. 15 to voice concerns about the quarry’s safety after a Post-Crescent Media editorial called for the closure of the quarry. An earlier Post-Crescent Media story found that 19 people have died there since 1979. 

During the meeting, Sieg said police have issued more than 125 citations at the quarry between Jan. 1 and Aug. 31, including more than 50 tickets for possessing alcohol on quarry grounds, and another 24 citations for underage drinking. 

Most recently, Illinois resident Marquis Hough drowned at the quarry over Labor Day weekend. Redgranite officials cleared the quarry after he went missing on Sept. 6. His body was recovered the next morning. 

Redgranite Police Chief Kyle Tarr said police have not yet received Hough’s toxicology results from the Fond du Lac County Medical Examiner, or results from this year’s second victim, Daniel Whitmore of Green Bay, who drowned at the quarry on Aug. 12. 

John Kroll, a lifelong Redgranite resident, attended Tuesday's meeting and said he’s “satisfied with the board’s decision to keep the quarry open. 

“I grew up here,” Kroll said. “I hear everybody saying, they’re making money on (the quarry). Nobody’s making money on it. And the alcohol’s coming from outside.”

Chinese President Xi Jinping has arrived in Washington for talks with US President Barack Obama. Key themes are expected to be Chinese cyber spying, economic policies and the territorial disputes in the South China Sea. 

Washington rolled out the red carpet for President Xi on Thursday evening, hastily replacing Vatican banners in front of the White House with Chinese flags. 

The Chinese president was greeted at Andrews Air Force Base by United States Vice President Joe Biden, soon after Pope Francis left the US capital for New York. Xi stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Biden as a band played the US and Chinese national anthems. 

A private working dinner between Xi and Obama was scheduled at the Blair House, the official US guest residence across the road from the presidential mansion. Washington officials said key issues of division would start to be addressed at the low-key meal. 

The two leaders took an informal walk to the dining venue from the White House's West Wing. 

The full pageantry of a state visit was to be reserved for Friday, when Xi will be given a 21-gun salute, and a formal summit and news conference will take place before a black-tie state dinner. Meanwhile, US first lady Michelle Obama was scheduled to take Xi's wife, Peng Liyuan, to the National Zoo, to see the giant pandas. 

Among the issues that divide the US and China is that of cyber security , with Washington threatening sanctions against Chinese companies and individuals that it claims have stolen US trade secrets. 

Pressure to 'open up' 

Obama is also expected to urge Xi to put into effect economic reforms that would make the Chinese economy more open to foreign competition. The US president was also thought likely to address China's increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea, where Beijing has been staging a military build up and land reclamation exercise. 

The issue of human rights could also find its way onto the agenda, but is not expected to be central. Protests were expected outside the White House from rights…",88eb2437-93ce-452d-ada0-905a90d0ccac,News,2015-09-25T01:13:28Z,MyInforms,China's Xi arrives in Washington DC for first state visit,0.0,Blog

2359,"Hollywood's love affair with space continues this weekend as Ridley Scott 's star-studded The Martian , starring Matt Damon , blasts off in 3,826 North American theaters. 
 
While the movie will have no trouble topping the chart, the big question is how much it will earn. Fox is suggesting a debut in the low $40 million range, while others have it launching between $45 million and $50 million. On the same weekend two years ago , Alfonso Cuaron 's space epic Gravity , facing far less competition, opened to a better-than-expected $55.8 million. In November 2014, Christopher Nolan 's Interstellar debuted to $47.5 million domestically. 
 
Gravity and Interstellar had the benefit of a berth in Imax locations, boosting the bottom line. The Martian isn't playing in Imax, since Imax is instead committed to an exclusive run of Robert Zemeckis ' The Walk . The Martian is, however, playing in more than 350 premium large-format theaters, a rival to Imax. Both films are playing up their 3D format. 
 
The Martian , currently sporting a 93 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, is based on Andy Weir 's best-selling book about an astronaut left for dead on Mars. Drew Goddard wrote the adapted script. Damon stars opposite Jessica Chastain , Chiwetel Ejiofor , Kristen Wiig , Jeff Daniels , Michael Peña , Kate Mara , Sean Bean , Sebastian Stan  and Aksel Hennie . 
 
Costing $108 million to make , The Martian is aiming for both commercial success and awards attention after playing at the Toronto and New York Film Festivals. It's also hoping for the same strong legs that Gravity enjoyed. 
 
Ditto for The Walk , which rolls out in roughly 440 Imax theaters and a relatively small number of PLF screens not carrying the The Martian . 
 
The Walk , kicking off the New York Film Festival last weekend, stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as French artist Philippe Petit, who gained fame after he walked on a high wire between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in 1974. Sony is billing the film as a love letter to the Twin Towers, as well as to 1970s New York and Paris. The Walk is based on Petit's book ""To Reach the Clouds"" and was adapted for the big screen by Zemeckis and Christopher Browne . 
 
Sony is touting the fact that The Walk is rated PG, meaning it is fine for kids. Also starring Ben Kingsley , the movie's net budget was $35 million. 
 
By opening The Walk first in Imax and PLF locations, Sony hopes to whip up strong word of mouth before the film opens nationwide Oct. 8. Universal employed the same tactic for Everest , to mixed results. As of now, The Walk boasts an 82 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. 
 
Everest grossed roughly $7 million when opening exclusively in Imax and PLF theaters; The Walk , which will likely play older, is eyeing $3 million. 
 
Denis Villeneuve 's critically acclaimed Sicario expands nationwide this weekend into roughly 2,500 theaters after soaring at the specialty box office. From Lionsgate, the drug cartel drama stars Benicio Del Toro , Emily Blunt and Josh Brolin , and should gross $8 million to $10 million when rolling out everywhere. 
 
New titles at the specialty box office include high-profile documentary He Named Me Malala , from Fox Searchlight. Lionsgate opens LGBT drama Freeheld , starring Julianne Moore , Ellen Page , Michael Shannon and Steve Carell,  in five theaters in New York and Los Angeles.",08d65c3d-463b-4027-9f40-a81d8842af4a,News,2015-09-30T00:53:52Z,Times-Courier,Box-Office Preview: 'Martian' Set to Rocket to No. 1; 'The Walk' Opens in Imax - Hollywood Reporter,0.0,News

2692,"He's one of Australia's most deeply experienced, best credentialled diplomats – and he has just weeks to try to persuade Japan not go to whaling in the Antarctic again. He's one of Australia's most deeply experienced, best credentialled diplomats – and he has just weeks to try to persuade Japan not go to whaling in the Antarctic again. Ambassador for the Environment, Peter Woolcott​, has been appointed as the new Australian Commissioner to the International Whaling Commission, significantly lifting the post's diplomatic profile.

A professional for 34 years from a legendary Australian diplomatic family, Mr Woolcott​, 61, recently marshalled a quiet, costly, and successful, offensive against the World Heritage in danger listing of the Great Barrier Reef.

His appointment book is also crowded as Australia's head of delegation to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which meets in Paris from November 30.

Mr Woolcott's appointment to the IWC by the Turnbull Government is understood to have been agreed under former prime minister Tony Abbott.

He succeeds a senior Environment Department bureaucrat, Donna Petrachenko​, who won praise for her work reforming the finances of the IWC and anchored the successful Australian case against Japan's whaling program at the International Court of Justice.

Since losing that case, Japan has announced a new ""scientific"" whaling plan, NEWREP-A, harpooning the first 330 whales in the upcoming Antarctic summer, and killing nearly 4000 minke whales over 12 years.

An IWC expert panel assembled to judge NEWREP-A said earlier this year that Tokyo had failed to demonstrate the need for killing whales to achieve the plan's objectives. In June, Japan also fell short of support from the full IWC scientific committee.

After that setback, Japan's IWC Commissioner, Joji Morishita​, told reporters it would strive to finalise NEWREP-A, but indicated a final decision to sail south was yet to be made.

""There are some recommendations we think we have to complete,"" Mr Morishita​ said. ""I don't think it's appropriate to say whether we will start such research activity from this [northern] winter or not.""

Mr Woolcott​ was not available for comment on Friday, but a spokeswoman for Environment Minister Greg Hunt said he would bring a wealth of international expertise to the role of Commissioner.

""Mr Woolcott​ will lead Australia's efforts to bring a permanent end to commercial whaling, and to reform the Commission into a modern, multilateral organisation capable of addressing the full suite of conservation needs, based on world's best practice and modern management principles,"" the spokeswoman said.

The International Fund for Animal Welfare's whales campaigner, Matt Collis, said that despite the weight of Mr Woolcott's​ other duties, Australians wanted urgent action against Japanese whalers.

""The most important thing is that Mr Woolcott​ urgently use his diplomatic clout to stop Japan from going whaling,"" Mr Collis said.

""Australians expect him to be an outspoken critic."" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.",91655549-d56d-4e8c-a71c-6ed2c5846754,News,2015-09-18T05:47:54Z,Coly Point Observer,Peter Woolcott appointed to IWC as Japan set to resume Antarctic whaling,0.0,News

A high-level meet to be chaired by Chief Minister Oommen Chandy here on Thursday will try to resolve the latest bottlenecks in the implementation of the Kochi Metro Rail project, including the dispute between the Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA) and St. Albert’s College over land usage and the remaining land acquisition hurdles before the State’s ambitious venture. 

The work on Kochi Metro’s International Stadium station and adjacent pillars had been affected after the GCDA insisted on the State government handing over land near the first Goshree bridge to compensate for the 65 cents it had to give to St. Albert’s College in the stadium. 

N. Venugopal, Chairman of the GCDA, said on Wednesday that the authority was ready to hand over the land to St. Albert’s but on a condition that the government should give GCDA 72 cents near CMFRI located next to the first Goshree bridge. 

“We will also bring the unilateral stance adopted by the college authorities in this issue before the Chief Minister at the meeting,” he said. KMRL sources said other issues to be discussed at the meeting included the deadlock over the transfer of 17.31 acres owned by the Public Works Department at Kakkanad; approval for the water transport project for funding from KfW, the German funding agency; and approval of the Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (UMTA) Act. 

Mr. Chandy will also unveil the interior and exterior designs of Kochi Metro coaches along with the new brand identity of KMRL at CIAL on Thursday.

3321,"When it comes down to selecting a nominee, the GOP finalists are likely to come from a group encompassing Carly Fiorina, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, John Kasich, Scott Walker, Chris Christie, and Jeb Bush. One is a former CEO of a major high-tech company; two are impressive young senators from big states (Texas and Florida); three are governors, and one a former governor, who won election and re-election in major states that Barack Obama carried. It's a reasonable field. All that has to happen to produce a good nominee is that one of the qualified candidates rises to the occasion.  So the Republicans face a few months of turmoil and recriminations.  The Democrats have a much more unpleasant prospect. They long ago settled on their inevitable bride, the nuptials have been scheduled seemingly forever ... and now they realize they've made a terrible mistake.  What to do? Go ahead with an ill-advised marriage, with no prospect of no-fault divorce until it's too late? Or call off the wedding when the invitations have already gone out? And then find someone else? They'd almost surely be better off admitting the mistake and spending some time playing the field—but that's easier for me to say than for them to do. And who tells the bride the wedding's off?

Ainsley said: “Clitheroe are coming here full of confidence after their good start to the season. 
 
“They have already won away from home once this season at Droylsden, which is no mean feat. We have to make sure we win and not drop out of the promotion pack.”

Priestley Keithley has joined on non-contract terms from Middlesbrough and, though frustrated by injuries in his forward ranks, Ainsley is delighted by the form of strikers Liam Henderson and Nathan Fisher. 
 
He added: “We have not had much continuity because of the injuries. 
 
“Frosty has only played 18 minutes of the first game and Glen injured his toe at home but their (Henderson and Fisher’s) workrate and commitment have been excellent and they will probably start against Clitheroe.”",48e76704-5ea9-4daf-a876-492d58a67a1f,News,2015-09-05T05:30:00Z,Newcastle Evening Chronicle,"Spennymoor Town must be wary of 'full of confidence' Clitheroe, says Jason Ainsley",0.0,Blog

2022,"Chinese conglomerate Fosun
International Ltd said it planned to raise up to
HK$11.69 billion ($1.5 billion) in an issue of rights shares to
fund mergers and acquisitions in the banking and insurance
industry. 

The move follows Fosun International's confirmation earlier
this week that it had started exclusive negotiations with the
Bank of Portugal to buy Novo Banco. 

""In order to be able to grasp business opportunities as they
arise and actively develop its insurance-oriented comprehensive
financial capability, the company wishes to optimize its capital
structure,"" chairman Guo Guangchang said in a filing to the Hong
Kong bourse late on Thursday. 
 
Fosun will issue up to 871.3 million rights shares, at 56
rights shares for every 500 ordinary shares held, for HK$13.42
per share, the Hong Kong-listed company said. Some of the
proceeds would be used to repay loans, it added. 
 
It gave no further details on acquisitions. 
 
Sources told Reuters last week that Portugal's central bank
would turn to Fosun to negotiate the sale of Novo Banco after
talks with China's Anbang Insurance Group Co
failed. 

In July, the Chinese conglomerate said it had purchased a
landmark building in the centre of Milan, as increasingly bold
Chinese firms flex their financial muscles overseas.

1875,"A British father who feared his baby had been swapped at birth and sold to human traffickers in El Salvador has reportedly been reunited with his son after authorities tracked down the child by ordering other new mothers have their babies DNA tested. 
 
		 
Richard Cushworth, 41, originally from Bradford, West Yorkshire,  and his Salvadoran wife Mercedes Casanellas had suspected that a doctor at the hospital where she gave birth exchanged their child for another as she slept. 
  It is feared the youngster was switched at birth   
After attending a special court hearing before a judge yesterday the couple were told that their biological baby had been identified before the swapped babies were handed back to their respective families, according to news website  Elsalvador.com. 

			 
Attorney general Luis Martinez told reporters: ""We have returned the babies to their legitimate parents.  We hope that this has not happened on other occasions."" 



 
Mr Martinez said that a review of private and public hospitals' protocols would take place. 

The couple's doctor, Alejandro Guidos, was arrested over the matter but had protested his innocence after being bailed. 

Prosecutor Dinora Siguenza reportedly alleged yesterday that Dr Guidos was responsible for not following correct procedures and is still being investigated. 

The couple left the Gynaecological Hospital Centre in the country's capital San Salvador with the newborn but made a public appeal on local TV three months on, after a DNA test revealed the boy was unlikely to be their biological son. 

			 
Ms Casanellas, 39, initially became suspicious when she noticed the features of her newborn differed from those of the boy doctors handed her the day after she gave birth by emergency Caesarean in May. In particular, she thought the second baby had darker skin. 

She took the child to the couple's home in Dallas, Texas, but the pair, both missionaries working in El Salvador, returned to the Central American country after family members also expressed doubts. 

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We are in regular contact with the Cushworth family to provide support. 

""A full investigation has been launched by local police and we will provide all the assistance that we can.""

899,"MUMS, dads and children at locations across the Sunshine Coast set off on a walk with one common mission: to bring William Tyrrell home. 
 
Similar events were also held across Australia at the same time, 10.30am yesterday. 
 
Exactly a year earlier, three-year-old boy William Tyrrell (pictured) was taken from his grandmother's home in Kendall, on the New South Wales mid-north coast. 
 
While there have been reports of sightings, the little boy, who disappeared wearing his favourite Spiderman costume, has not yet been found. He would now be four. 
 
A group of Coolum locals organised their own Walk for William, starting at Tickle Park and walking along the beachside cliffs to Point Perry. 
 
Despite the grey weather at least 150 walkers participated yesterday. 
  Christina and Riley Clifford.   
Walkers wore red and blue in recognition of William's favourite superhero, and many kids - as well as organiser Angela Gray - donned full-length Spiderman suits. 
 
Ms Gray said the Walk for William idea was intended to ""make the community take note"". 
 
""We will not sweep him under the carpet,"" she said to the crowd. 
 
""We will keep onto this until he is brought home or until somebody is brought to justice. 
 
""He is a little boy, like all of the kids here. He should be at home with his parents. 
 
""Ours is a simple one in Coolum but it is in respect for William."" 
   
Organiser Angie Dunbavan said she hoped the various walks would jog someone's memory about the disappearance, or compel those with information to come forward. 
 
She said it also represented a chance for parents to start a conversation about safety with their children. 
 
""It's a really good opportunity to raise community awareness around stranger danger,"" she said. 
 
""About how to protect yourself as a child, and what parents can do to be more vigilant."" 
 
Yaroomba mum Christina Clifford attended the event with her son Riley, who turned three last week, the same age William was when he disappeared. 
 
Mrs Clifford said William's disappearance had hit her ""straight to the heart"". 
 
""I just cried and cried,"" she said. 
 
""Australia should be a safe environment to just let kids be kids, and taking advantage of a little three-year-old, it makes me sick in my guts, basically."" 
 
She said she was trying to talk to Riley about William during the walk. 
 
""I'm trying now to explain to him what we're doing here, but it's not easy to explain to a three-year-old,"" she said. 
 
""He keeps saying 'where is William, we have to try and find William'.""",c08a7181-e540-4bb4-b54d-24c68ffaf533,News,2015-09-12T20:10:20Z,Fraser Coast Chronicle,Stepping out to bring young William Tyrrell home,0.0,News

NEW YORK -- Well, you know what they say: The 10,000th win is the hardest. The New York Yankees will have three more cracks to make history at Boston's expense, but it didn't come Monday night at Yankee Stadium, where the Yankees fell 5-1 to a brace of Red Sox hatchlings.
The Yanks had a chance to become the first American League franchise to win 10,000 games. They also had an outside chance to clinch a wild-card spot, though three pursuers would have had to lose.
Neither happened, as those wacky Red Sox kids wreaked havoc all game long on a Bronx playground they claimed as their own Monday night -- and some folks thought the Yanks were catching a break when interim manager Torey Lovullo gave slugger David Ortiz the night off.
Rookie left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez, in his final start of 2015, held the Yanks to seven hits (six of them singles) and a run in six innings. He became the first Sox rookie left-hander since John Curtis in 1972 to win 10 games.
Rookie first baseman Travis Shaw, batting in Ortiz's cleanup spot, hit a two-out, first-pitch, two-run home run off Ivan Nova in the sixth to give the Sox their first lead, 2-1.
Still-cutting-his-teeth Jackie Bradley Jr., playing left field with Rusney Castillo out because of a tight quad muscle, made two terrific catches and hit a two-run home run that just cleared the short fence in left to make it 4-1 in the seventh. The home run was Bradley's 10th of the season.
Rookie Noe Ramirez, embracing interim manager Torey Lovullo's vision of him as a right-handed specialist, came on to coax a double-play ball out of Alex Rodriguez to end the seventh.
Rookie Deven Marrero, playing third base because Pablo Sandoval has been declared a casualty of pneumonia, hit his first big-league home run in the ninth to stretch the Sox's lead to 5-1, with a fan undermining the hard-earned Bronx tradition of nothing but contempt for the opposition by actually tossing the ball back onto the field.
The Yanks have had their way with the Sox for much of this season -- they've won 10 of 16 meetings -- but not Monday night. With the Blue Jays rallying to beat Baltimore, Toronto's magic number for clinching the AL East is down to two games.
A Red Sox victory and Yankee loss Tuesday, and the Sox could be the catalyst for a celebration north of the border.",e2f2d1fb-46e5-468e-805d-387f5b385753,Blog,2015-09-28T22:21:32Z,ESPN Feed: - blog,"NEW YORK -- Well, you know what they say: The 10,000th win is the hardest.

5787,"Do you feel insecure about your appearance? Do you wish you could change the way you look? No matter what you look like, there are plenty of things you can do to make yourself more beautiful. This article will provide you with some beauty tips that can make anyone look and feel better.Rub Vaseline on your cuticles once a week. This will help to keep your nails as healthy as possible during the day. It helps your nails and the skin around them to look shinier and healthier, too. It won't take long to see results, as this works on your nails almost instantly.Gently brush your lips with a soft toothbrush. This will help you remove dead skin cells from your lips and make them soft. You should then apply Vaseline or another type of lip balm to moisturize your lips and keep them soft. You can do this every day or every other day.You can adjust your hair's style and color to better accentuate the shape of your face. Seek cuts featuring long lines and that fall somewhere between the jawline and the shoulders. Use low-lights and highlights as appropriate to frame your face. Asking your hair dresser http://www.abimelec.com/epilation_laser.html - http://www.abimelec.com/epilation_laser.html - to include these special touches to your next hair appointment will make you look more beautiful.Exfoliate your face and neck at least 2 times a week. Exfoliating helps remove dead skin cells and bring new skin cells to the surface. This will make you look healthy and refreshed when you do this, but you should avoid doing it too much because it can irritate your face.Use a face mask at least once a week. Depending on which one you choose, this will help remove impurities from your face. A mud or clay mask is best for removing impurities. You will see results immediately. Once you find a mask you like, you should stick with it.If you have overly round eyes, you can elongate them by adjusting your eyeliner application. The outer two-thirds of your lower and upper lash lines should be lined with a dark brown liner. The two lines should meet at the outer corner of each eye. Finally, apply two coats of mascara to your outer upper lashes.Choose your eyeshadow based on your eye color to make your eye makeup really pop. If your eyes are blue, shades of brown are the most flattering. For brown eyes, try purple shadows like lavender or plum. If your eyes are green, golden shades are very flattering, as are many shades from the brown family.Most women would be surprised to know that the average female devotes more than 60 hours of her life to the ordeal of shaving and waxing. Laser hair removal, while somewhat costly, will save you a great deal of time and nicks on your legs, underarm, face, and bikini area.If you have dark circles under your eyes, try using rosewater or cucumbers to lighten the skin. These will naturally cool and calm your eyes while lightening the skin underneath them. Take a pad that is made of soft cotton, dip it in the rosewater or cucumber juice and take a fifteen minute rest with the pad on your eyes.Improving beauty starts with improving your knowledge on how to take care of yourself. What separates those who maintain a sharp appearance and those who simply do not bother, often amounts to nothing more than know-how. When you know what you need to do to look good, it is far easier to make that happen.To hide purplish under-eye circles, try a yellow concealer. The yellow helps to cancel out the purple, leaving a smooth palette for applying your foundation. A thin layer of creamy yellow concealer also makes a great primer layer for your eyeshadow, because it minimizes the appearance of capillaries and helps the shadow stick.Never ever apply a tanning lotion when you are in a hurry as this will always lead to disaster! This is one beauty item you really need to take your time with otherwise you end up looking freaky, so smooth the tanning lotion well over elbows, knees and feet and wash your hands thoroughly to avoid streaking. Use your tanning lotion well in advance of sleeping to prevent a complete botch job and well in advance of any https://www.facebook.com/pages/Centre-Epilation-D%C3%A9finitive-Paris/1605650989719981 - look at here now - special occasion, just in case!To get rid of white patches on your nails, consume more calcium. The patches are a sign of vitamin deficiency. Clearing up those white spots will allow you to get a smoother and more consistent look with your nail polish. If you can't add more calcium to your diet, start taking a supplement.Try using a loofah to get rid of skin imperfections. A loofah exfoliates your skin and buffs any problem areas, leaving your skin smoother. Combine this with some exfoliating body wash for excellent results. For optimum results, use the loofah two times every week.You are very good at applying your makeup and washing it off at the end of the day. Are you as diligent when cleaning your makeup brushes? Chances are, you are not. It is advised to wash your makeup brushes at least once a month using a gentle soap such as baby shampoo. Lather them up gently, rinse, and let them air dry.Spray mist over your face after you have your makeup applied. It will set the makeup and keep it where it should be much longer. This is a great method to use when you have a long day ahead of you like if it is your wedding day or you have a night out after work planned.Use the ignition part of a matchbook or box if you don't have a nail file. If you find yourself in need of a nail file, but can't seem to find one, you can use the rough part you use to light matches on a match book as a nail file.If you have natural plum lips, it is unnecessary to wear lipstick. It will just take away from the unique feature that your lips already have. If you still insist on using lipstick, stick with a color that is a darker pink, and use a fine brush to apply a thin coat.It's important not to be influenced too much by what society deems beautiful. You should define your own version of beauty.

3319,"TEST PATTERN: J.J. Martin can add a new line to her résumé: fashion designer.
The journalist and vintage fanatic on Thursday night held a cocktail with retailer Matchesfashion.com during Milan Fashion Week to mark the launch of a collection of dresses made with Italian manufacturer Mantero Silk.
For her first outing under the label LaDoubleJ Editions, she opted for a short-sleeved A-line style that hits just above the ankle, available in eight archival patterns dating from the 1910s to the Eighties.
“I’m a big maximalist. I love print, I love pattern, but I think you kind of need it in really simple lines,” said Martin, sporting one of her own creations in a bold pattern called Confetti.
“Basically, what we wanted to do was create the easiest, most fail-safe silhouette that literally looks good on every woman, and you’ll have no problems with those areas that every woman is concerned about: the hips, the butt, the stomach. You can have as much dinner as you want, you still fit in the dress,” she added.
Available exclusively on her Web site, LaDoubleJ.com, and Matchesfashion.com, the dresses retail for $480. Further collections are already in the works.

NEWTOWN TOWNSHIP >> It didn’t take long for the board of supervisors to go on the record with their opposition to fracking, unanimously approving a succinctly-worded resolution asking that two moratoriums banning the practice in Bucks County and the Delaware River Basin be kept in place. 

The resolution, which passed by a 5-0 vote at the Sept. 9 supervisors’ meeting, calls on the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) to make permanent its moratorium on shale gas development, which up until now, does not have a hard-and-fast expiration date. 

In addition, the resolution asks the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to also keep in place its moratorium against issuing permits to drill for oil or natural gas in southeastern Pennsylvania. 

The state’s five-year moratorium on the controversial practice is set to expire on Jan. 1, 2018. 
 
Voting for the resolution were: Chairman Ryan Gallagher and Vice Chairman Mike Gallagher, as well as Supervisors Kyle Davis Phil Calabro and Jennifer Dix. 

Copies of the resolution will be sent to the DRBC, Gov. Tom Wolf and the state legislature asking them to support the moratoriums. 

According to the resolution, Pennsylvanians are entitled to clean air and pure water. It also claims that the state and DRBC have not conducted proper assessments of the long-term effects on hydraulic oil and natural gas drilling on residents' health and the environment. 

The resolution also states: “In the absence of such assessment, it is impossible to determine whether or not shale gas development can proceed safely without creating risks to public health, property values and clean air and water.” 

Fracking opponents who packed the meeting applauded the vote, including Elizabeth Tatham of Holland. 

“I appreciate you following up so quickly,” she told the board. “Thank you for being proactive and this resolution will help Newtown.” Continued... 
  According to the opponents, if fracking is allowed in the area it would create health, safety and environmental problems, with the top worry being groundwater contamination. 
Fracking, which refers to hydraulic fracturing, is when large amounts of water or other chemicals are forced into a drilled shaft at high pressure to loosen oil, natural gas or other resources from thousands of feet underground. 

If, or when, the state and DRBC moratoriums are lifted, drilling companies are expected to seek permission to drill in southeastern Pennsylvania in what is known as the South Newark Basin. 

The basin includes all of Bucks County and parts of Montgomery County. 

However, at this time there are no known deposits in Newtown, Wrightstown and Upper Makefield townships, which make up the Joint Municipal Zoning Ordinance (JMZO), or what is commonly referred to as “the jointure.” 

In order to regulate where that drilling could occur in the jointure, jointure officials have drafted a 17-page ordinance limiting fracking to a zoned area in Wrightstown Township where the quarries currently are located. 

The proposed ordinance was presented to the other two jointure members for consideration. 

Coincidentally, Wrightstown has four-areas specifically zoned for quarries and currently there is very little quarry land now available. 

All three municipalities would have to pass the proposed ordinance for it to take effect. 

Township solicitors have warned that if no specific areas are designated, then drilling companies could challenge municipalities in court, claiming that restrictive zoning prevents them from conducting business. Continued... 
  However, opponents argued that such an ordinance, no matter how well-intended, should not be approved, instead claiming that officials in the jointure should ban the practice outright. 
Marguerite Chandler of the Pennswood Village retirement community in Middletown Township has been fighting fracking for years. 

According to Chandler, properties which have drilling leases on them, especially those with well-water supplies, are finding it harder to get mortgages and homeowners’ insurance. 

She said that neighboring properties to those with leases are also negatively affected. 

In addition, Chandler noted that local governments may also be responsible if a drilling company is underinsured and streams or the Delaware River watershed is contaminated for the millions of people who depend on it for drinking water. 

At a July 8 meeting, anti-fracking activists had implored the Newtown supervisors to formally oppose the practice. 

Vice Chairman Mike Gallagher had told the group that the board supported their efforts to keep fracking out not only Newtown Township, but all of Bucks County. 

“We're with you on this,” he had said. “Our job is being proactive.” 

And Gallagher had explained that the proposal to relegate fracking to the Wrightstown quarries is a legal strategy that the jointure has come up with for when the moratorium is lifted. 

“Let's figure out how we can stop fracking,” Gallagher asserted. “How do we defend against the driller who wants to come in and take our natural resources?” Continued... 
  Fellow supervisors agreed that they don’t want oil and natural gas drilling in the township. 
Many opponents point out that New York State banned fracking after seven years of exhaustive scientific studies, concluding that it would create unsatisfactory health and safety issues. 

Tracy Carluccio, deputy director of the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, a non-profit volunteer group which helps protect the Delaware River watershed, has suggested that the DRBC should make its fracking moratorium permanent. 

“Shallow (fracked) wells are close to aquifers and will contaminate groundwater,” she had stated at the July supervisors’ meeting. “Five percent of all wells drilled leak within five years.” 

Carluccio attended the latest supervisors’ meeting and presented the board with updated materials on fracking’s alleged dangers. 

In other action at the meeting, the board unanimously approved the hiring Gilmore &Associates, Inc. as the township's trail consultant. 

The New Britain-based engineering firm was one of three finalists that the supervisors interviewed for the newly-created position. 

Gilmore & Associates will be tasked to come up with a “Comprehensive Trail Plan” to link and enhance Newtown Township’s numerous trails to make them more attractive to hikers and bikers. 

Fostering economic development and attracting recreational tourism will also key components of that plan, as is protecting the environment. 

Over the years, a number of the existing area trails have been developed by public and private entities, but the paths are now somewhat scattershot around the township. 

In his State of the Township message in January, Supervisor Chairman Ryan Gallagher said that one of his goals for 2015 is creating a comprehensive trail strategy. 

And in a 4-1 vote, with Supervisor Dix dissenting, the board also approved hiring a company to update the township's somewhat antiquated website. 

Five bids were received and the Wrightstown-based AnchorMark Branding Co. was chosen to overhaul the municipal Web page, not only sprucing it up, but also providing residents with more information and linking the site to social media, including Facebook. 

AnchorMark bid $15,000 for the project, money which was allocated in the 2015 township budget for website improvement. 

One of the planned upgrades would help the site integrate better with mobile devices, such as smartphones, which is a problem for the current website. 

In addition, township forms for permits would still be available online, but there would also be a way to pay fees on the website. 

Videos of supervisors’ meetings now posted online would also be improved. 

The planned changes include allowing a person who is watching the supervisors' meeting live on a cable access channel to have the capability to go online and pull up the same Google Docs packet of public information that is on each supervisor's desktop computer. 

When completed the new website is expected to be much easier for administrators to change the information, so it could be updated more regularly.

Gilmore & Associates will be tasked to come up with a “Comprehensive Trail Plan” to link and enhance Newtown Township’s numerous trails to make them more attractive to hikers and bikers. 

Fostering economic development and attracting recreational tourism will also key components of that plan, as is protecting the environment. 

Over the years, a number of the existing area trails have been developed by public and private entities, but the paths are now somewhat scattershot around the township. 

In his State of the Township message in January, Supervisor Chairman Ryan Gallagher said that one of his goals for 2015 is creating a comprehensive trail strategy. 

And in a 4-1 vote, with Supervisor Dix dissenting, the board also approved hiring a company to update the township's somewhat antiquated website. 

Five bids were received and the Wrightstown-based AnchorMark Branding Co. was chosen to overhaul the municipal Web page, not only sprucing it up, but also providing residents with more information and linking the site to social media, including Facebook. 

AnchorMark bid $15,000 for the project, money which was allocated in the 2015 township budget for website improvement. 

One of the planned upgrades would help the site integrate better with mobile devices, such as smartphones, which is a problem for the current website. 

In addition, township forms for permits would still be available online, but there would also be a way to pay fees on the website. 

Videos of supervisors’ meetings now posted online would also be improved. 

The planned changes include allowing a person who is watching the supervisors' meeting live on a cable access channel to have the capability to go online and pull up the same Google Docs packet of public information that is on each supervisor's desktop computer. 

When completed the new website is expected to be much easier for administrators to change the information, so it could be updated more regularly.",890ec8f3-ad38-4d1d-b319-0b748610c089,News,2015-09-10T18:03:52Z,Newtown Advance,Newtown Township Supervisors unanimously pass resolution supporting a continued moratorium against fracking here,0.0,Blog

By Philip Pullella and Jeff Mason 
 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Wednesday urged the United States to help tackle climate change and touched on other divisive U.S. political issues such as immigration and economic inequality on his first visit to the world's richest nation. 
 
In a speech on the White House South Lawn on the first full day of his U.S. trip, the Argentine pontiff lauded President Barack Obama's efforts to reduce air pollution as ""encouraging,"" months after Francis made the environment one of his top concerns by issuing a landmark encyclical letter to the church. 
 
""It seems clear to me also that climate change is a problem which can no longer be left to a future generation. When it comes to the care of our common home, we are living at a critical moment of history,"" the pope said at a welcoming ceremony. 
 
In an era of renewed U.S. racial tensions, the 78-year-old pope invoked America's best-known civil rights leader, the late Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., to make points about the environment and equality. 
 
The pope later said Mass in Spanish to about 25,000 gathered inside and outside the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception and canonized 18th-century Spanish missionary Friar Junipero Serra. The canonization was controversial because critics say that Serra beat and imprisoned Native Americans, suppressed their cultures and facilitated the spread of diseases that heavily reduced the population. 
 
During the first canonization on U.S. soil, Francis in a homily hailed Serra as a man who ""sought to defend the dignity of the native community, to protect it from those who had mistreated and abused it."" Some Native American activists condemned making Serra a saint, with one, Corrina Gould, saying Serra intended to wipe out the native people. 
 
Speaking to American bishops at the Cathedral of St. Matthew, Francis said the sex abuse of minors by clergy should never be repeated, acknowledging the damage caused by years of scandal in the U.S. Catholic Church. 
 
The pope referred to the bishops' ""generous commitment to bring healing to victims."" But David Clohessy, head of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, who himself was sexually assaulted by a priest as a child, said, ""Bishops have been cowardly, not courageous, and still are."" 
 
As Washington streets were closed and federal workers stayed home, about 15,000 people gathered in bright sunshine and warm temperatures on the South Lawn. They heard the pope depart from his usual practice and give a speech in English. 
 
He again made a gesture of simplicity, pulling up in the small black Fiat car he used for his arrival in the U.S. capital on Tuesday. 
 
Francis is a critic of the damage caused to the world's poor and the environment by capitalism's excesses. The pope also commented on immigration and religious freedom, issues on the U.S. political agenda ahead of the November 2016 presidential election. 
 
'SACRED OBLIGATION' 
 
Obama, whose plans for climate change legislation were thwarted in Congress early in his presidency, said he shared the pope's concerns about the environment. 
 
""Holy Father, you remind us that we have a sacred obligation to protect our planet: God's magnificent gift to us. We support your call to all world leaders to support the communities most vulnerable to a changing climate and to come together to preserve our precious world for future generations,"" Obama said. 
 
Francis and Obama held about 40 minutes of talks in the White House. An interpreter was the only other person present and the White House declined to detail the talks. Both men see eye-to-eye on climate change and defense of the poor but hold different views on abortion rights and gay marriage. 
 
Francis gave his support to traditional marriage, pointing out that he will travel to Philadelphia later in his six-day visit to the United States for a meeting of Catholics ""to celebrate and support the institutions of marriage and the family."" The U.S. Supreme Court in June legalized same-sex marriage across the United States. 
 
In an apparent nod to the fierce debate in the United States about illegal immigration, Francis described himself as the son of an immigrant Italian family in Argentina. ""I am happy to be a guest in this country, which was largely built by such families,"" he said at the White House. 
 
The pope also said U.S. Catholics are committed to building a ""truly tolerant and inclusive"" society that rejects discrimination. Francis also mentioned the ""millions of people living under our system, which has overlooked them."" 
 
""I would like all men and women of goodwill in this great nation to support the efforts of the international community to protect the vulnerable in our world,"" the pope said. 
 
Adoring crowds waving white-and-yellow Vatican flags cheered the pontiff on a parade through Washington streets as the leader of the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics sprinkled some stardust in a city not unduly impressed with important foreign visitors. 
 
At one point, he had his converted Jeep stop when he saw a baby in the crowd. Francis was handed the 5-month-old son of Salvadoran immigrants who live in Virginia, and kissed the boy, Loukas Chavez, on the head. 
 
""I just thought it was an unbelievable moment,"" said the baby's mother, Iris Chavez, 25, her daughter, Emely, almost 2, in her arms. 
 
The first Latin American pope, Francis has electrified liberal-leaning U.S. Catholics, Democrats and many non-Catholics with a shift in emphasis toward concern for the poor and immigrants and his appeals to combat climate change. But his criticism of unbridled capitalism has unsettled U.S. conservatives. 
 
Francis will give the first speech by any pope to the U.S. Congress on Thursday, an address to the U.N. General Assembly in New York on Friday and an open-air Mass in Philadelphia where 1.5 million people are expected to attend on Sunday.

2805,"It is one of this summer’s four perfect days, a Friday afternoon to boot, and London’s most smug are bunking off work and descending like fashionable, tanned zombies on Shoreditch House members’ club. Meanwhile in a joyless, north-facing, little-used room called the Library you’ll find Robert Pattinson, the 29-year-old British actor. He’s not tanned; famously, he has the pallor of an eternally youthful bloodsucker. He’s not smug either; in fact it would be hard to find someone less pleased with themselves. And he’s come to Shoreditch House today to work – to do interviews anyway, one of the least enjoyable elements of a job that he’s not convinced he’s especially good at.
Does Pattinson come here often? “Um, yeah, kind of, er. Ish,” he eventually decides on. “I used to go to the gym here until I realised that I didn’t want people to see me going to gym.” He laughs, a posh, unexpected, winning guffaw. “I was so embarrassed,” he continues. “When you’re trying to lift up your 10lb dumbbells… Word spreads.”
Pattinson is monochromatic today: white T-shirt and thin jacket; black jeans, boots and unmarked baseball cap. He has a bushy beard (our pictures were taken before he grew it). It’s the kind the Victorians favoured, with a twiddly moustache, for a part he’s currently shooting. “Oh, this is driving me insane,” he says. “Let me know if I’ve got something hanging off the side. Avocados are especially bad.” Pattinson strokes his chin: “Hmmm, yeah, avocados are not beard-friendly.”
It’s around this point, maybe a couple of minutes in, that I realise I’m going to quite like Pattinson. It is not particularly something he’s said, but his, for want of a better word, vibe. If anyone could be forgiven for being an oddball, it’s him. Any chance Pattinson had of a normal career – a normal life – vanished when he appeared, aged 22, as the vampire Edward Cullen in 2008’s Twilight. Over five films he became very rich, unpleasantly famous and kinkily lusted over. One example: last year in Las Vegas, a woman married a life-size cardboard cutout of Pattinson; on their honeymoon, she carried “him” up to the Hollywood sign.
Such attention, such unsolicited devotion, would be a brain scramble for anyone. But what’s endearing about Pattinson is that it is easy to see the kind of person he was before he became one of the most famous actors in the world. He’s a bit of a goof. He’s prone to gabbling about, say, having a gloop of avocado on his face.
In short, Pattinson doesn’t carry himself like he’s God’s gift. He remains recognisably a 20-something from suburban London whose dad sold vintage cars and whose mum was a model booker.
The most interesting thing about Pattinson these days is the career he’s curating. To oversimplify it, pretty much any director would want Pattinson in their film: he has a name that gets a project green-lit and a fanbase that means people are sure to see it. Yet he has chosen to use this power in an unconventional way. Sometimes he actively seeks out filmmakers who he admires: “There’s not a lot of them, and I like quite specific stuff.” He doesn’t demand the biggest role or for his name to be in the largest type on the film poster – though that’s usually what happens anyway. He’s worked with cult auteur David Cronenberg twice (Cosmopolis and Maps to the Stars) and with Werner Herzog, as TE Lawrence in the forthcoming Gertrude Bell biopic, Queen of the Desert, alongside Nicole Kidman and James Franco. He’s just signed up to play an astronaut in Zadie Smith’s first screenplay.
And this month Pattinson stars in Anton Corbijn’s Life, a warm, perceptive film about James Dean. But Pattinson isn’t playing Dean; he is Dennis Stock, a Magnum photographer who befriended the actor in 1955 and took the iconic shot of him walking in Times Square, smoking, huddled against the rain. Pattinson insists he didn’t, even for one second, consider lobbying for the role of Dean, a role taken by Dane Dehaan.
“I wouldn’t even know where to begin,” says Pattinson. “I guess the only reason anyone would think that is from Twilight, because people always said about ‘brooding’. I’m not entirely sure what brooding is, other than a chicken sitting on her eggs. So I’m not entirely sure why that’s considered an attractive trait.”
There are, however, intriguing parallels to be drawn between Dean and Pattinson, two of the defining stars of their eras, or at least an examination of how the nature of celebrity has changed in the 60 years between their respective peaks. In Life, Dean is caught on the cusp of fame, shortly before the release of his debut film, East of Eden (in the ensuing eight months he would shoot two more films, including Rebel Without a Cause, before dying in a car crash aged 24). The studio, Warner Bros, puts him forward for interviews and Dean mucks them up, partly through inexperience, partly through sabotage.
Pattinson certainly knows how that feels. “When the first Twilight came out, I’d definitely say dumb stuff just so I wouldn’t sound cookie-cutter or part of the machine,” he recalls. For the most part this was pretty tame, such as admitting he took a Xanax before his final audition to calm his nerves or saying that he had been drunk for a year before he landed the part, living in a “cool little ex-crack den” with his best friend, the actor Tom Sturridge. “It’s not very difficult to shock people when you can literally just swear,” Pattinson says, laughing again. “You talk about being hungover and you just see the publicity department waving their arms going: ‘Shut up! Shut up!’”
In other ways, though, Life makes it clear how much the interaction between celebrities and the media has changed. Stock, at Dean’s encouragement, follows the actor home to Indiana, to the farm where he grew up with his uncle and aunt in a Quaker household. The intimacy of their exchanges – and the photographs that relationship produced – would be unimaginable in the present day.
Pattinson concedes as much. “The idea of taking a photographer back to my family’s house… it’s just insane!” he says. “It’s not really even to do with the photographs – it might be nice to have a really good photographer do it, but it’s bringing your family into the public domain and then having to have them deal with this horrible cacophony of demons who live on the internet. That’s really ruined a lot of things, internet trolls, because no one wants to put themselves out there. Even if you can ignore it, and I don’t think anyone can really ignore it.”
There’s not anger in Pattinson’s voice, just acceptance of the uncomfortable Faustian pact he’s made for success in his chosen field. “With my sisters” – Victoria and Lizzy, both older; Lizzy, a singer, appeared on last year’s X Factor, reaching the stage where hopefuls audition at the judges’ houses – “you just bring people into something they have not asked to be part of,” he continues. “It’s impossible for you to stop it afterwards. All you can say is: ‘I’m sorry. I’m sorry for bringing this darkness into your life. And also you don’t get anything out of it either.’ It’s just nothing but bad, yeah.”
Plenty of people in entertainment and outside it really want to be famous. Pattinson, meanwhile, more than any public figure I’ve encountered, appears to be desperate to be less well-known than he is. The point where celebrity was useful to him is long distant. He already has more money than he knows how to spend. In Los Angeles he bought a house – “like Versailles,” he’s described it – but moved out after the paparazzi set up camp outside. He owns 17 guitars, but that’s as far as extravagances go.
“Fame is just in the way for Rob,” says Anton Corbijn, who has considerable experience of working with superstars, first as a portrait photographer and more recently as a film director. “We were shooting in a really cold winter in Toronto and there were days where it was definitely -22C and still there would be some paparazzo photographer hanging in a tree somewhere for a whole day. Even in extreme circumstances, in the middle of nowhere, he gets followed. That must be tiresome.”
Would Pattinson want to be less recognisable, then? “I don’t even think I am that famous anymore,” he says unconvincingly. “I just moved back to London and the thing that always drove me crazy in LA was photographers. You don’t even really care about having your photograph taken, but it’s the following, the trailing, knowing that you can’t escape it. But I moved back to London and it just doesn’t happen ever.”
Really? “Uh huh. Unless you’re at the Chiltern Firehouse or somewhere. That’s it. The infrastructure doesn’t exist here. And celebrity press – they are interested in different things in England. Which is wonderful!”
He might be giving us too much credit there. Pattinson’s relationships are a staple of gossip columns, especially since he split with Kristen Stewart, his Twilight co-star, in 2012. He is currently stepping out with, and almost certainly engaged to, the singer FKA Twigs – hence the return to London – but he’s learned enough to keep it on the down-low. When I raise the subject today, he replies, good-naturedly: “Oh yeah, that. I’ve just found if you never talk about stuff it’s better. But thank you.”
Pattinson’s personal experience, of enduring Twilight and coming out the other side, does seem to have left a residual interest in the smaller cogs in the machinery of Hollywood. In last year’s Maps to the Stars he played an aspiring actor and writer who is really a chauffeur and has an unlikely hook-up with a neurotic big-time actress played by Julianne Moore. In Life his character Dennis Stock witnesses up close what the movie industry is starting to do to James Dean. The lesson, in both cases, appears to be that it’s not easy to remain sane in this business.
Pattinson, though, sees it differently: it’s not that movie stars are weird; everyone is weird. “I think people are pretty extreme,” he says. “If you look at anyone’s behaviour, you meet a lot of nutcases. I can hang out with my family and it’s like a mental asylum.” He’s laughing hard now. “They’ll be like: ‘Oh, why are you saying this about us?’”
Acting, Pattinson insists, remains a learning process; he never studied it and he became Edward Cullen when he still thought he wanted to be a musician rather than an actor. This leads to a bizarrely self-deprecating estimation of his talents. Pattinson rarely watches his own performances – he has still never seen the final Twilight movie – but he does assiduously seek out negative comments on the internet. “I do read reviews to a fault, and it’s an awful thing to do,” he admits. “It’s an addiction. And you only read the bad ones, too, just to foster hatred, self-hatred, self-loathing. Yeah, weird habit.”
“I don’t know if it’s insecurity, but he’s far more gifted than he gives himself credit for,” says Corbijn. “Obviously success came relatively easy to Rob with the Twilight series, and ever since then he’s taken on left-of-centre roles to prove – I guess to himself – that he is an actor and not just a famous actor. That’s really courageous of him, but he underestimates his own quality. He’s nervous. I think he beats himself up a lot – unnecessarily so, in my eyes.”
Corbijn describes “an inner turmoil” he sees in Pattinson. Does Pattinson recognise that in himself? “Err, ha ha, yeah, sort of,” he replies. “Sometimes. I think everyone does, really, but I definitely feel like I need to prove something, and I’m not entirely sure what it is. So that’s probably what my turmoil is.”
Pattinson goes silent for a few seconds. “Confusion!” he eventually exclaims. “I’m definitely very confused. I spent basically my whole 20s having no idea what was going on. And I do feel now that I’m gaining a little bit of perspective.”
The analysis session is almost over. Pattinson walks over to an upright piano by the window and idly plays a few notes. He started taking lessons again recently for the first time since he was a teenager; he thought he would be more enthusiastic this time, but practice is still a drudge. He closes the lid and finishes a thought from a couple of minutes before.
“In a lot of ways, I’m quite proud that I’m still getting jobs,” Pattinson says. “To go from starting a job by accident when you’re 16 and maintaining it somehow and learning how to do it on the job as well. Because of falling into a job, you always feel like you’re a fraud, that you’re going to be thrown out at any second. So yeah, the main thing I do hope is to gradually get rid of that and really be doing what you want to be doing without feeling like you’re faking it. Does that make sense?”
With his intriguing, ambitious post-Twilight career, it is making less and less sense, but it says a lot about Pattinson that he still thinks it.

3468,"Pole-sitter Carl Edwards and his No. 19 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota topped the speed charts again Saturday morning in the first of two practices for Sunday's Sylvania 300 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway. 

As a team, JGR has won eight of the past 10 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races and 12 of 27 overall this year. 

Edwards, who was also fastest in Friday's lone practice, had a best lap of 133.516 miles per hour around the one-mile NHMS oval during Saturday's session. That was enough to best Kevin Harvick, who ran 133.427 mph. 

Harvick comes into the second race of the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup needing to come up big after a cut tire last week left him 42nd in the race and 15th in points. Speed hasn't been a problem this weekend for Harvick, as he qualified second behind Edwards on Friday in the No. 4 Stewart-Haas Racing Chevrolet. Harvick was fastest in 10-consecutive lap average. 

Third on the board behind Harvick was Brad Keselowski, who clocked in at 133.399 mph in the No. 2 Team Penske Ford and had the fastest five-lap average. He was followed by his teammate, Joey Logano, the defending race winner. 

Fifth was Harvick's teammate, Kurt Busch in a second SHR Chevy. Busch's crew chief, Tony Gibson, had an emergency appendectomy Tuesday but is in New Hampshire for the race weekend. Dale Earnhardt Jr. was sixth. 

The final Happy Hour practice runs from 11:30 a.m. to 12:20 p.m. ET.

994,"Britons unfairly charged IHT between 2011 and 2014 Specialist firm says thousands are due compensation But it claims making a case is 'fiendishly complicated' without help  
Up to 30,000 Britons with holiday homes in Spain could still be due compensation from its government after they were hit with 'unfair' inheritance tax charges. 

The punitive tax charge was made between 2011 and 2014 on non-residents – which in Spanish law is those who live there for less than half the year – who inherited a home. This included husbands and wives whose spouses died.  

The redress is expected to run into millions of euros for those hit. According to estimates by specialist solicitors Spanish Legal Reclaims after analysing government data, around 30,000 paid tax in the three-year period. 
   
Unfair tax: Those who faced an IHT bill on their Spanish holiday home during 2011-14 are entitled to compensation. Pictured, Andalucia in southern Spain 

The tax charge was in many cases up to a third of the property's value and it varied between regions. 

It can only be reclaimed by EU citizens after the Spanish government hastily changed its IHT law after the European Court of Justice ruled the legislation - which exempted residents from the charge - was discriminatory. 

The ruling was made last September but it is believed thousands still haven't got the ball rolling with compensation - despite there being a five year limit to put a claim in.  
 
Claims typically take between six to eight months to process once they've been filed and the first glut of compensation is now being paid out. 

Under the law, between 2011 and 2014 Spanish residents were exempt from up to 99 per cent of the tax charge depending on region, while homeowners with a property there had to pay the full amount within six months of inheriting. 

With more Britons owning holiday homes in the sun in Spain than any other nationality, UK citizens were disproportionately affected. 

They include Joan Ridsdale, a 62-year-old payroll administrator from County Durham who was hit with a €16,000 tax bill when her husband Gordon died. The couple owned a two-bedroom bungalow in the coastal resort of Almeria. 

Mrs Ridsdale was forced to cash in her life savings to pay the charge and has since sold the property. 

The Spanish authorities are now being forced to repay the inheritance tax paid by non-residents like Mrs Ridsdale. 

She was one of the first to receive compensation from the Government earlier in the year. 

The average repayment is €25,000, according to Spanish Legal Reclaims, a Barcelona-based law firm which specialises in helping non-residents to reclaim overpaid tax. 
   
EU ruling: Last year, EU said the Spanish Government had acted unfairly - and people can claim redress 

Luis Cuervo, chief executive of Spanish Legal Reclaims, said: 'Losing a loved one is hard enough, but to then receive an unfair tax bill rubs salt in the wound. Yet for years this is what happened to thousands of Britons inheriting holiday homes in Spain. 

'Spain's authorities have agreed that non-residents who inherited a Spanish property during the past four-and-a-half years can claim back the tax they paid – but doing so is a complex and daunting task, as there is no single form to fill in. 

'Inheritors can only claim once, so it's essential they seek expert legal advice to ensure they get it right first time. 

'Spanish Legal Reclaims is representing 1,000 families from across the EU who find themselves in this position, and since the ECJ's landmark ruling our firm has had a 100 per cent success rate, securing a full refund of tax in every case.' 

Britons account for a substantial part of the law firm's business, it says.  

The largest refund it secured for a British client was €94,000, the smallest €4,400. 

However, it takes a large 35 per cent chunk of any compensation on a 'no win, no fee' basis. 

Mrs Ridsdale used the firm to handle her case – it secured a full refund of her €16,000 tax bill, plus €700 in back interest from the Spanish taxman.  

But, with the fees, she was left with just under €11,000. 

The firm says it is possible for British holiday homeowners to reclaim the tax themselves, but it is 'fiendishly difficult'. 

They need to work out whether they can claim and then the process involves filling in multiple forms and making your case in court, which is all in Spanish.  

Homeowners only get one attempt to lodge a compensation bid.

  On September 25 a 41-year-old Pakistani man was shot and fatally wounded after pulling a weapon on a liquor clerk in Louisville, Kentucky.  
The incident occurred around 11 pm. 
 
According to WLKY , police say the man–Sami Abulaila–allegedly “displayed a weapon in an attempt to rob the store.” At that point, the clerk “fired several shots,” striking Abulaila an unreported number of times. 
 
Abulaila was taken to the hospital where he later died. 
 
Louisville Metro Police Department spokesperson Alicia Smiley said, “There were no other persons inside the liquor store at the time of the incident. There were no injuries to the employee of the liquor store itself.” 
 
The liquor store clerk returned to the store to work his normal shift the following day.

3627,"10 de septiembre de 2015,   09:56 Beijing, Sep 10 (Prensa Latina) The Prime Minister of China, Li Keqiang, assured today that the future of this countryâÖs economy is brilliant thanks to its solid base and strong thrust of its development. 
 When speaking at the Davos Summer Forum, held in the northeastern city of Dalian, Li explained his is not a blind optimism because the State has the advantages of a great potential and domestic resistance. 
The main programs to promote the new industrialization, computer technology, urbanization and agricultural modernization are in action, which will expand the countryâÖs demand, he added. 

To this respect, he said the variety of industries of this nation guarantees an economy characterized by resistance and self-recovery. 

He considered the structural reforms to achieve a sustainable economic expansion, have been successful. 

As the largest emerging country in the world, China will continue developing measures to maintain a medium-high growth with greater efficiency and quality, he stressed. 

On the other hand he extolled the financial reform, emphasizing the importance of the place and the laws to boost an open capital market, transparent and stable, as well as the improvement of risk control. 

Also he explained that China has the support of a great volume of savings and hard currency reserves. 

Commenting on the initiatives introduced, he said that besides reducing the interest rates and the obligatory reserve coefficient, this territory has eliminated a top rate of interest, both for loans as for deposits, allowing that more private capital enters the sector. 

The reform will also promote private Banks, giving them a financial guarantee and financial leasing, he revealed. 

He mentioned the most recent changes of the central yuan parity system, saying these modifications did not have anything to do with the increase in exports and that the country was against a currency war.

1829,"The mini-hiatus is over, but I must admit that Canterlot Boutique didn't do much for me.  It certainly wasn't a bad episode, but I couldn't make much of the message behind it.  Or the economics; how is Rarity planning to support both the Canterlot and Ponyville stores with only stuff she makes?  I've seen other people suggest she'll be able to support herself with a ""unique designs only"" policy based on the last part of the episode, but I don't buy it; her manager sold 100 Princess Dresses at full price in less time than it took Rarity to unload five original designs, and those five were all at sale prices to boot.  Seems to me that Canterlot Boutique isn't long for this world, unless Rarity either learns to embrace mass production and a designer role for herself in her fledgling empire, or closes down the Ponyville branch to focus on supporting a single store.
Or maybe the Magic of Friendship will prove as effective at handling unsustainable business practices as it is at vanquishing unbeatable monsters.  Yeah, probably that one.  Anyway, click down below the break for my thoughts on the first sentences I've read recently! As a reminder, the first sentences here are being judged as first sentences, using my patented HEITSIBPMFTSIATRAEMTCR (""how effective is this sentence in both preparing me for the story I'm about to read, and encouraging me to continue reading"") scale.  On that scale, a five equates roughly to ""immediately evokes a specific tone, prepares the reader for the rest of the story, and encourages me to continue reading,"" a one is ""makes me less likely to continue reading,"" and a three is ""a perfectly adequate first sentence, which neither inspires great excitement or great dread.""  For each story, I'll give the title with a link to my review of it, and the star rating I initially gave that story.    Additionally, we're changing the format in a few ways this week: first, I'll be clarifying that the rating after the title is the original rating I gave to the story, and second, the review of the sentence will be split into two parts.  The first part will be my thoughts after reading ONLY the first sentence, and the second, my thoughts on it after having read the story, graded as BETTER, WORSE, or THE SAME when taken in its larger context.    Oh, and if you still don't like the format... well, let's just say you'll want to make sure to check out Wednesday's post! Of Apples and Roses and Thick Purple Proses, by Ravensdagger (story: 2 stars)
The first sentence:  The mare focused. Initial thoughts:  What this lacks in detail or scene-setting, it makes up in succinctness.  It's a very forgettable first sentence, but it pretty much demands that the reader continue on to the next one (the next paragraph, in fact, as this sentence stands alone at the start of the fic).  As such, I'd call this an unremarkable but nonetheless effective first sentence.  Three stars. After reading:  The fact that the sentence sets up the mare's accidental destruction of a century-old bonsai tree leaves a sour taste in my mouth, I must admit.  It's a ""sad funny"" sort of thing; a scene played as slapstick, but which ends up feeling too tragic for its own good.  The first sentence, in context, also becomes one of a number of similar emphasizers, showing how careful she's trying to be (and then failing due to her ""friend""'s antics).  In the end, further reading makes it WORSE. Mortality Report, by Bad Horse (story: 3 stars) The first sentence:  While pacing back and forth along the length of the castle's finest guest room, Princess Celestia paused in mid-stride, her attention caught by the full moon. Initial thoughts:  There's certainly nothing wrong with this sentence in terms of construction or prose... but it's an awfully generic sentence nevertheless.  ""Celestia looks at the moon"" is, at least in the context of an MLP fandom where stories about Celestia and Luna's relationship are a dime a dozen, a total non-event in terms of engendering reader interest, and the one noteworthy detail (that Celestia's in a guest room, rather than hers, her sister's, or the like), is easy to gloss over.  Still 2 stars, as it's hardly a bad first sentence; it's just unmemorable and general.
After reading:  It turns out that the first sentence is part of a double-fake.  The first fake is in presenting a ""normal"" situation, before revealing that somepony is dying.  This is also the expected (and very common) fake.  The second, unexpected one comes when we discover that the story isn't about Celestia saying goodbye to a dying Twilight, but something else entirely.  I'm still not convinced I can say it's great in the context of a first sentence--you have to get to that second fake before there's any payoff, and that's a good dozen paragraphs into the story.  Lots of readers will give up on something that looks boring after the first dozen paragraphs, and what I'm trying to judge here isn't whether the story is good, but whether that first sentence is effective in and of itself.  Still, it certainly looks BETTER in context.
Pirates for a Day, by Dawnfade (story: 1 star)
The first sentence:  Trees are strange things.
Initial thoughts:  I like this a lot.  It's the sort of slightly odd, eye-catching statement that gets one's attention without resorting to excessive zaniness or gore or the like.  It's not particularly quotable, but it's reasonably memorable and draws a reader in.  4 stars.
After reading:  I don't think I mentioned this in my review, but the first few paragraphs of Pirates are quite nice, promising something a bit more thoughtful (but still fluffy) than the story delivers (it being pure, unadulterated fluff).  Tense issues notwithstanding, the explanation for the strangeness of trees definitely sells the story to come as a friendly, accessable story of the sort that leaves one's heart just a little warmer for having read it, and if the rest of the fic doesn't deliver, that's outside the purview of a first sentence to fix.  If anything, the first sentence looks BETTER as part of that introduction.
The Monster in the Twilight, by Georg (story: 3 stars)
The first sentence:  Princess Celestia paced the quiet paths between buildings in her School for Gifted Unicorns, trying not to display the nervous tension that ate at her soul.
Initial thoughts:  Compare this to the first sentence from Mortality Report, which also features Celestia pacing (doing these posts has made me more aware of first sentences in general, and I've noticed that ""Celestia pacing"" is all over this fandom's first sentences).  On the plus side, the setting and her explicit nervousness give the reader something to immediately latch onto that falls outside what might be considered her ""ordinary"" set of locations and moods.  On the downside... ""the nervous tension that ate at her soul"" sounds really hokey, and feels overwrought and almost silly without context.  I'll go 2 stars for this, since it's triggered a warning bell or two in my head.
After reading:  Turns out that sentence leads straight into some old-school ""Celestia angsts over Luna's banishment,"" which doesn't really excite one to continue.  On the other hand, the reason why Celestia's so nervous makes sense in context, enough that ""ate at her soul"" might not even be overstatement.  Still, this one feels about THE SAME to me after reading further.
Tyrant, by PaulAsarian (story: 1 star)
The first sentence:  There was a knock on the throne room doors.
Initial thoughts:  This falls into the same ""unremarkable but effective"" catagory as Of Apples etc.'s first sentence.  I... don't really have much to say beyond ""this does what it sets out to do, without being otherwise exceptional.""  On my scale, that's the definition of 3 stars.
After reading:  It's THE SAME.  I mean, it goes exactly where ""There was a knock on the throne room doors"" has to go: we find out who's knocking, who our viewpoint character is, and proceed from there.  It's still perfectly fine for what it is.
I'd Do Her, by Fire Gazer the Alchemist (story: 1 star)
The first sentence:  Rainbow hovered mere feet away from an immensely sweaty Applejack.
Initial thoughts:  I like that this highlights and contrasts the salient attitudes toward work of Applejack and Rainbow Dash (a belief in the value of manual labor, and an intense focus on flying) entirely through their physical descriptors.  For a SoL/Comedy story called I'd Do Her, that probably constitutes overthinking, but there you go.  Anyway, another 3 star sentence in my book, giving us characters and some small context without being otherwise noteworthy.
After reading:  The weird fixation on AJ's sweatiness through the opening scene feels almost fetishistic, which casts that first sentence in an unfortunate light in retrospect.  Reading on definitely makes this one WORSE.
The Life and Times of a Winning Pony, by Chengar Qordath (story: 2 stars)
The first sentence:  “C’mon Blossom, we’ve got celebrating to do!”
Initial thoughts:  I've seen people comment that they don't like cold opens into dialogue, but I think they can be perfectly effective--as this one is.  It's not a memorable or otherwise interesting line, but it gives us an immediate sense of the piece's tone while inviting us to read further to find out crucial bits of context (like who's doing the talking).  3 stars.
After reading:  The first sentence is indeed indicative of the story's early going, in that it's a celebratory scene and mood at the start.  In other words, this is of about THE SAME effectiveness as I initially took it to be.
The Price of Grace, by Sparkle (story: 2 stars)
The first sentence:  It was midnight, but the lights in Canterlot Tower were still burning.
Initial thoughts:  I find this evocative in its simplicity.  ""Burning the midnight oil"" is a common expression for a reason, and this is essentially that expression writ large.  It's true it doesn't give us much hint of mood (this could mean tragedy, general labor, or even extended revelry), but I'll still give it 4 stars for catching the imagination without using any unusually tired phrasing for its classic imagery.
After reading:  The opening's got some poor writing, and leans heavily on tired, banal storytelling elements.  The former doesn't really matter as far as that first sentence is concerned, but the latter does; it suggests that the difference between classic and cliche in that first sentence is a happy accident rather than deliberate, and even paints it with the same brush as the later bromides.  I still think it's a nice first sentence, but I'd say that it seems WORSE for having read further.",ad48adf4-2bc8-479c-9c2d-33d53088fbd6,Blog,2015-09-14T05:00:07Z,One Man's Pony Ramblings,First Sentences In (Fan)Fiction the 7th,1.0,News

1078,"Today I'm wearing Décou-Vert, an intriguing and sophisticated fragrance from the Italian fragrance house, Laboratorio Olfattivo. Boldly contemporary, the house maintains a steadfast commitment to preserving the inspiration of a nose from the conception of a fragrance to its completion, displaying an unyielding respect for perfumery as an art form. Strict rules and slick marketing strategies are the antithesis of Laboratorio Olfattivo's ethos, and each nose that works with the house is given free reign to craft a fragrance that is a truly unique expression of their inspiration. This unlimited creative freedom has resulted in a range of truly stunning, challenging, and vital fragrances; scents that hold a special resonance for the creator and give the wearer a unique emotional response to each composition. Created by nose David Maruitte, Décou-Vert is a scent characterised by its ambition and subtlety, inspired by his desire to blend three distinct, ostensibly contradictory fragrance types into one harmonious whole. With characteristics of Green, Floral, and Vegetal scents, Décou-Vert is truly a 'green discovery', opening up a whole new way of experiencing a green floral fragrance with its herbaceous character and magnificent magnolia accords. A base of musk and light woods, coupled with delicate magnolia pollen, yields a dry down to be savoured throughout the evening and long into a crisp autumnal night.

1716,"Self-service Supply-Side Platform Fyber Connects Publishers and App Developers to Over 120 Leading Dsps 


BERLIN, GERMANY --(Marketwired - September 14, 2015) - Fyber, a leading advertising technology platform, announced that it has seen a weekly revenue increase of more than 250% for its next generation Mobile Video product on the Fyber Exchange between May and August 2015 while impressions increased by over 330%. Mobile video in general saw strong growth on the Fyber platform in recent months. This underscores a strong monetization and growth opportunity in mobile and multi-screen video as Fyber's prominent ad format. 

The exponential growth in the number of mobile devices globally is driving mobile video ad spend at a faster rate than any other type of digital marketing. According to eMarketer, advertisers will spend $3.94 billion on mobile video next year, an increase of 50 percent. This growth is further supported by increases in programmatic ad spend, which is projected to reach $2 billion for video on all devices, and double again in 2016. 

""To capitalize on mobile video as the fastest growing ad format, we need to make the campaign buying process as easy and transparent for advertisers as possible,"" said Janis Zech, Fyber's co-founder. ""This means a continuous investment in Fyber's programmatic capabilities to strengthen the value provided by our own Exchange, on top of our vast mediated demand offerings."" Earlier this year , the company acquired RTB (real-time bidding) platform Falk Realtime to strengthen its own programmatic stack by offering premium programmatic pre-roll and in-app inventory. 

The results of this strategy are underlined by the impressive roster of demand-side platforms that are working with Fyber. Over 120 of the world's leading DSPs and demand source partners -- including AppNexus, DataXu, MediaMath, The Trade Desk, TubeMogul, and YuMe -- now bid on Fyber's global inventory. 

""Growing our sources of quality inventory has been essential to our business,"" said Tim Sims, head of inventory partnerships at The Trade Desk. ""We're pleased to be partnering with Fyber to deliver programmatic video campaigns on a global scale with Fyber's multi-format, multi-screen inventory."" 

""Partnering with industry leaders like Fyber is critical for us as we build out a broad and deep portfolio of supply for an open video marketplace,"" said Eric Hoffert, senior vice president of video technology at AppNexus. ""Fyber's focus on mobile video and global inventory is particularly attractive to many of our buyers. Together we are committed to maximizing reach and value for marketers to deliver campaigns for video users across multiple devices."" 

In addition to Fyber's programmatic capabilities, the company recently rolled out a new wave of market-leading enhancements to its mobile video products. These include an improved video player UX and advanced pre-caching controls that allow app developers to choose when and how many video ad network SDKs they want to initialize at app-start, resulting in a reduction in data and memory usage, loading times, and an overall improvement in app performance. The company has also extended its mobile video product offering to Android devices to better cater to cross-platform advertisers. 

""As advertisers move toward a cross-screen approach, having highly-viewable mobile video inventory available for automated buying is vital,"" said Keith Eadie, chief marketing officer at TubeMogul. ""We applaud Fyber for its momentum and are proud that our software is contributing to that growth by offering brands a single solution to centralize buying and optimization across screens."" 

Meet us at DMEXCO 
Fyber will highlight its recent product innovations at DMEXCO in Hall 6, B071 on September 16-17th in Cologne, Germany.

2290,"Police took two days to investigate a sighting of missing 13-year-old schoolgirl Amber Peat close to where she was found dead, a report has found. 
 
The Independent Police Complaints Commission is looking into Nottinghamshire Police's search for the missing teenager after her body was discovered in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on June 2. 
 
Documents released by the IPCC reveal a member of the public told officers about a girl who matched Amber's description disappearing into the bushes close to her home on Bosworth Street on Sunday, May 31. 
 
But the intelligence was not followed up until 48 hours later, when officers went with the caller to the location where Amber's body was found. 
 
The IPCC's initial assessment says there were ""significant concerns"" with the search for the schoolgirl, including officers only upgrading her disappearance to ""high risk"" 16 hours after she went missing following a family dispute. 
 
Amber was reported as a missing person by her family at 12.56am on May 31 and was classed as a medium risk, and this was only increased to high risk at 4.55pm. 
 
The report said: ""It is very worrying to read this matter was classed as medium risk on its initial assessment, I am of the opinion that this should have been categorised as high risk. Given that Amber was merely 13 years of age and had an extensive history as a missing person, I am of the view that this scenario constituted a high risk. 
 
""My concerns have heightened given the officers actions when handling potential leads. After scrutinising the incident report, I do acknowledge Nottinghamshire Police recieved a copious amount of suggestions for Amber's location. 
 
""However, given that Amber was located at the same scene that they were informed about on 31/5/2015, I am of the view that the investigation may need to scrutinise how officers handled the intelligence. 
   Promoted stories   
""I also note that soon after this incident was reclassified as high risk, intelligence was receieved from a member of the public which ultimately would lead to the discovery of Amber's body. 
 
""Therefore, it will be for the investigaftoin to consider whether this incident had been classified as high risk fom the outset valubale intelligence could have been obtained sooner."" 
 
Nottinghamshire Police's log, which was submitted to the IPCC, said: ""On June 2 officers spoke to the member of the public who had called the police on May 31. In order to identify the location of the sighting they went with the caller to the location they had last seen the female. 
 
""Officers found her body well hidden within a large thicket of bushes.

2773,"The Health division of Wolters 
      Kluwer , a leading global provider of information and point of 
      care solutions for the healthcare industry, announced today that Health 
      Language experts will lead a breakout session titled 'A 
      Strategic Approach to Terminology Management Challenges in Population 
      Health and Analyticsâ€� at the 87 th Annual AHIMA Convention and Exhibit . Stephen Ross, M.D., 
      Medical Informatics Specialist, and Brian Laberge, Director of Client 
      Services Strategy, will discuss the critical role terminology management 
      strategies play in achieving success with population health management 
      (PHM) and data analytics.  
  
Scheduled for September 30 at 11:15 a.m. in Rooms 271-273 of the New 
      Orleans Convention Center, the presentation will highlight the 
      challenges healthcare organizations currently face when laying a 
      foundation for semantic interoperability. Presenters will discuss the 
      need for efficient strategies to address data normalization of clinical 
      terminologies coming from inbound and outbound sources, and attendees 
      will learn the value of enterprise code group management and how to 
      align a broader enterprise terminology management strategy with data 
      analytics and PHM efforts. 
 
Identified as important strategies for healthcare organizations 
      operating within risk-bearing reimbursement arrangements, PHM and data 
      analytics require high-level information sharing capabilities. Because 
      the industry lacks a universal terminology standard, data must be 
      normalized upon intake to support semantic interoperability; otherwise 
      there are inevitable conflicts with management and distribution when 
      clinical information is shared between organizations. 
 
'As the movement to value-based care marches forward, healthcare 
      organizations must deploy infrastructures that will support 
      sophisticated data analytics and effective management of population 
      health,â€� said David A. Del Toro, President & CEO of Clinical Software 
      Solutions at Wolters Kluwer. 'Terminology management strategies are 
      foundational to this process, and Health Language solutions are on the 
      leading edge of this movement, equipping healthcare organizations with 
      the technology-enabled workflows and capabilities needed to position for 
      success.â€� 
 
Designed to enable effective clinical information exchange, the Health 
      Language family of products including LEAP Code Group Manager will be 
      featured at AHIMA (Booth #812). Wolters Kluwer's enterprise terminology 
      management platform provides the software, content, and consulting 
      solutions needed to map, translate, update, and manage standard and 
      enhanced clinical terminologies on an enterprise scale, enabling the 
      information liquidity required to support such healthcare challenges as 
      Meaningful Use compliance, ICD-10 conversion, population health 
      management, and analytics.

1541,"NOVANEWS    Obama turned down a request from  Jordan  for Predator spy drones that would help it locate targets in the war against Saudi Zio-Wahhabi ‘ISIS’.    

 
Jordan’s Zionist puppet Abdullah II and his master Zionist Benjamin Naziyahu 
 Washington Times   The refusal, disclosed by a House Armed Services Committee member, has gained attention since  Jordan  has emerged as a critical player in a U.S.-led coalition to destroy Syria.  

 Members of Congress  called on the White House to approve a list of weapons for CIA Zionist puppet of Jordan, “The decision to deny the request should be reversed immediately,”  Mr. Hunter  wrote. “Doing so will provide  Jordan  critical mission capability in the fight against the Islamic State and ensure  Jordan  is given every advantage.  The Arab Daily News   In another sign of the increased cooperation and strategic military alliance between the Nazi regime of I$raHell and CIA puppet of Jordan, news reports said that the Nazi regime will supply Jordan with two types of drones to help Jordan ”fight the Islamic State in Iraq, ISIS”.  

 The London based Jane’s Defense magazine which reported the news earlier this week based on Zionist news sources said that Zionist regime will supply Jordan with 12 “Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) Heron TP strategic and Elbit Systems Skylark tactical UAVs.”  The Heron TP is the largest and most sophisticated UAV in service since entering the Nazi army in 2010. The drone can fly to an altitude of 45,000 feet and stay there for up to 40 hours if necessary.  Nazi regime has been helping Jordan in its fight against Assad government by supplying its Puppet and strategic ally with high tech weapons to protect its borders against the ”terrorist group”.  

 
The Heron TP (Eitan) UAV is designed to fly at high altitude on missions spanning over several days. This HALE (High Altitude Long Endurance) UAV has a wingspan of a Boeing 737 and weighs 4.5 tons; and of that, 1,000 Kg is payload. The Eitan, derived from the `Heron’ MALE (Medium Altitude Long Endurance) platform, was developed by Nazi Aerospace Industry (IAI). 
 Nazi defense website reported last week that a joint Jordanian-I$raHell command and control war room is currently leading the air campaign against ‘ISIS’ from a base in northern Jordan.  Sources in the Pentagon, however, who did not wish to be identified for this story told the Arab Daily News that the Nazi drones will help Jordanian Special Forces currently fighting ‘ISIS’ in Iraq and supporting the US troops on the ground there. A total of 12 Nazi-made UAVs will be delivered to Zionist puppet of Jordan in the near future.  

 
Jordanian and Nazi flags fly side by side at Peace Park 
 Images  seen online on August 13 also showed Royal Jordanian Air Force Lockheed Martin F-16 Fighting Falcons parked next to Nazi Air Force Boeing F-151 Eagle (Ra’am) fighters at Lajes Field in the Azores on their way to the United States for joint exercises, accompanied by a group of Nazi Air Force KC-707 fuel tankers.  Also last month,  with its retired Cobra helicopters after the US performed the necessary overhaul and updates. The Arab Daily News also reported that Nazi fuel tankers refueled Jordanian F16s Mid Air on their way to the US to participate along with Nazi F15s in Red Flag military exercise at Nellis Air Force Base North of Las Vegas Nevada.

650,"Pressing questions are always asked about my prime-time viewing: 
My wife: “What network is ‘Brooklyn Nine-Nine’ on?” I didn’t answer. Instead, I asked: “What
broadcast network did ‘The Mindy Project” air on?” She said: “NBC!”   

It’s a confusing media world for sure. 

“Mindy” was on Fox; now
at Hulu; “Nine-Nine” is going into its third season on Fox, one of the few shows to grow its audience -- 4.87 million in its second season from 4.80 million viewers. So, who cares what
network it’s on? Branding, schmanding! 

On the flip side, there are easy network brand associations: For many in my household, it can be easy to identify the content on networks like Food
and Hallmark, but tough to identify specific shows. 

Over the weekend, I stumbled upon the team-time trial race at the World Road Cycling Championships in Richmond, Virginia -- not on NBCSN, the
sports network-- but on CNBC, NBC’s business news network. I guess this make sense: This time of year I’m “cycling” in and out of stock investments in my
portfolio. 

Seeing content in places you don’t expect? Not a trend. 

Still, NBC regularly uses many of its dozen or so cable networks when it has way too many Olympic events to cover.
Turner airs plenty of NCAA Men’s basketball tournament games on its networks. Viacom recently aired the MTV “Video Music Awards” this year on many more of its cable networks. 

Much of this makes economic sense, with networks looking to monetize increasingly expensive programming assets. 

So with the start of the new season, does it matter that the average TV
viewer might not associate new shows with their networks, like “Supergirl” and “The Muppets”? (“Supergirl” will be on CBS; “The Muppets,” ABC”). 

Yes, you might say broadcasters can have a strong identify: CBS has lots of crime procedurals; ABC has racy and sharp dramas. 

Yet in the future, established TV network brands might want
to be a lot of more than they are.",f69ff4d5-ebaf-4c85-a3c1-4f185887e57c,News,2015-09-22T19:26:37Z,Media Post,"New Season, New Shows, Still Guessing About TV Networks",0.0,News

The net loss of national joint-stock company Naftogaz Ukrainy in 2015 will total UAH 6 billion due to subsidized prices of gas used for heating households, Board Chairman Andriy Kobolev has said. 
 
""If we take the average price of imported gas [in 2015], which is very optimistic, $250 per 1,000 cubic meters, the total loss of Naftogaz in 2015 would be UAH 6 billion,"" he said in the parliament on September 18. 
 
He said that the average price at which Naftogaz Ukrainy sells gas for the needs of households and heating providers to households is slightly more than UAH 3,000 (VAT not included). 
 
""Naftogaz could compensate UAH 6 billion from other sources to maintain the price of gas for households stipulated in resolutions of the NCER [the National Commission for Energy, Housing and Utilities Services Regulation ],"" he said. 
 
Kobolev said that in 2015, 12.8 billion cubic meters of gas produced in Ukraine will be allocated to households. All the other needs of households will be covered thanks to imported gas. 
 
He also said that not all the gas produced by public joint-stock company Ukrgazvydobuvannia goes to households, and that some gas is produced under agreements on joint operations with private companies. 
 
""We [have for] several times proposed that the parliament and lawmakers amend the law, then there would appear a possibility of giving gas made under joint production agreements to households. This would be a kind of re-privatization. If the decision is made, Naftogaz would make it with pleasure,"" he said. 
 
In turn, Ukrgazvydobuvannia Board Chairman Oleh Prokhorenko said that in 2015, the company could produce around 14.5 billion cubic meters of gas, including 1.2 billion cubic meters under joint production agreements, with 500 million cubic meters being required for the technical needs of the company and for the operation of gas booster stations. In 2014, around 2 billion cubic meters of gas was made under joint production agreements, he said.",5e2e9a45-ceaa-427b-847e-57dc9db4266c,News,2015-09-21T08:45:05Z,Interfax-Ukraine,Naftogaz's loss is UAH 6 bln in 2015 due to subsidized gas prices for housing – company head,0.0,News

NRL: Steve Roach joins Fox Sports News to discuss the NRL Finals and the situation surrounding the possible release of Martin Taupau.

THE votes are in, the surveys have been tallied and the first round of the NRL Premiership Tournament is in the bag.

There were a couple of shock losses, a couple of big wins and a couple of match ups that went right down to the wire.

We’ll kick off the quarterfinals with a quick recap of Round 1 before diving into the new match ups.

• The closest match of the first round was the 2007 Storm and the 2013 Roosters. The Roosters lead for most of the voting period but Melbourne surged back over the weekend to take out the match with a 50.18% share of the vote — or by a margin of just nine votes.

• The 2002 Roosters also went down in their other clash against the 2003 Panthers with Penrith winning another nail biter after getting 50.88% of the vote. In something of a shock result, both Roosters teams have been bounced in the first round.

• Newcastle enjoyed the most lopsided victory in Round 1 when they belted the 1999 Storm after gaining 71.88% of the vote.

• When our Random Match Generator (also known as picking the teams out of a hat) threw up the Manly vs. Manly clash in Round 1 it raised more outcry than a Daly Cherry-Evans backflip, but in the end the people of the Northern Beaches voted with their clicks and sent the 2008 Sea Eagles through to the quarterfinals. They trashed their 2011 counterparts after gaining 70.74% of the vote and given the feedback on Facebook and Twitter they’d be considered one of the favourites to go all the way.

• Brisbane fans came out in force with the 2006 Broncos earning 62.66% of the vote to smack the 2005 Tigers, the 1998 premiers downing the 2014 Rabbitohs after getting 59.44% of the vote and the 2000 Broncos bringing the pain against the 2012 Storm, running away with 62.27% of the vote.

• True to form, the 2004 Bulldogs are flying right under the radar and got past the 2010 Dragons with 55.38% of the vote.

On to the quarterfinals VETERAN: OUT: Pearce succumbs to hamstring injury

2003 Penrith Panthers vs. 2006 Brisbane Broncos 2003 Penrith Panthers Season record: 21-6

Wins by 1-12: 12

Wins by 13+: 9

Average winning margin: 11.76

Wins over top eight teams: 13

Despite surging to the minor premiership and winning an incredible 20 of their last 23 games, the 2003 Panthers were counted as title outsiders right up until grand final day. Their average winning margin of 11.76 is the lowest of any team still in contention but they have the equal highest number of wins over top eight sides.

2006 Brisbane Broncos

Season record: 17-11

Wins by 1-12: Five

Wins by 13+: 12

Average winning margin: 17.47

The 2006 Broncos have the worst overall record of any of the teams remaining and are the only team left who lost more than 10 matches. They also boast the longest losing streak of any team left in the tournament after they dropped five matches on the trot between Round 18 and Round 23. Their average margin of victory is a respectable 17.47, which places them firmly in the middle of the pack, but the 2006 Broncos have the look of a team that was competitive without being dominant in the regular season who managed to hit form at just the right time to surge into the title picture.

1998 Brisbane Broncos vs. 2007 Melbourne Storm 1998 Brisbane Broncos Season record: 21-6-1

Wins by 1-12: Seven

Wins by 13+: 14

Average winning margin: 24.48

Wins over top eight teams: 10

After the first week of the Premiership Tournament it was clear that the 1998 Broncos were overwhelmingly strong title favourites and when we dig into the stats we can see why. They have the third greatest number of 13+ wins among remaining teams and the highest average winning margin. While these numbers are impressive, it’s worth remembering what kind of competition the NRL was in 1998. In the bloated, newly united competition there were 20 teams, which meant that the footballing talent was spread way too thin. This created a serious world of the haves and the have nots, and nobody had more than Brisbane. That’s not to say the 1998 Broncos were flat track bullies, but all stats need to be examined in the proper context.

2007 Melbourne Storm

Season record: 24-3

Wins by 1-12: Nine

Wins by 13+: 15

Average winning margin: 19.21

The decision to include a Melbourne team that was over the salary cap was controversial to say the least, but their clash with the 1998 Broncos promises to be one for the ages. This Storm side have the best record of all remaining teams and the second highest number of 13+ wins. Throw in an equal-highest 13 victories against top eight teams and its easy to see why they’re one of the stronger teams still in contention. Winning 16 of their last 17 and outscoring their finals opposition 100-18 wasn’t too shabby either. MAGIC: SHARKNADO: Cronulla charter fan flight to Townsville 

2008 Manly Sea Eagles vs. 2001 Newcastle Knights 

2008 Sea Eagles

Season record: 20-7

Wins by 1-12: Three

Wins by 13+: 17

Average winning margin: 21.85

Wins over top eight teams: Nine

With the exception of the 1998 Broncos, no team got more love in Round 1 than the 2008 Sea Eagles. While they weren’t able to snag the minor premiership, they did record the highest number of 13+ wins among active teams with an incredible 17. They also have the second highest average margin of victory with 21.85, but notably only beat nine top eight teams all season, the lowest total among teams still in contention. One of the real strings to their bow remains their imperious run through the finals, where they outscored their opposition 110-12 in possibly the most dominant finals series ever.

2001 Newcastle Knights

Season record: 19-9-1

Wins by 1-12: 10

Wins by 13+: Nine

Average winning margin: 19.23

Wins over top eight teams: 10

Statistically, the 2001 Knights were the second best attacking team of all time (trailing only the team the beat in the grand final, the 2001 Parramatta Eels) but their pointscoring aptitude isn’t really reflected in the stats. Their average winning margin of 19.23 is good without being great and their 10 wins over top eight teams is of similar standard. This team definitely had an attitude that the best form of defence was more offence, while their 19-9-1 record is the second worst of any of the teams still in contention.

2000 Brisbane Broncos vs. 2004 Canterbury Bulldogs 2000 Brisbane Broncos Season record: 21-6-2

Wins by 1-12: Nine

Wins by 13+: 12

Average winning margin: 19.05

Wins over top eight teams: 11

The 14-team competition that came about in 2000 meant that talent was more highly concentrated and, on the whole, teams had much more depth than they had in the chaotic Super League years. As a result, the 2000 Broncos average winning margin of 19.05 and 11 wins over top eight teams, which are both good enough for fourth among remaining teams, are ever more impressive. Minor premiers by six points, they might not have the prestige of their 1998 counterparts but they might fly under the radar and run all the way to the title.

2004 Canterbury Bulldogs

Season record: 22-6

1-12 wins: Nine

13+ wins: 13

Wins over top eight teams: 12

With the second highest number of wins over top eight teams and the fourth most wins by over 13 points, the 2004 Bulldogs are arguably the most underrated team still in the tournament. While they finished second after losing the minor premiership to the Roosters on for and against, their 22 wins is the second highest among the remaining teams.",873c77cd-475e-49b1-9478-4b98126573c6,News,2015-09-17T03:36:00Z,NEWS.com.au,NRL Premiership Tournament: Quarter Finals,0.0,Blog

A year after the devastating floods struck Jammu and Kashmir, former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah today asked the Centre to allow international aid to the state if it did not have money or was unwilling to announce any package for rehabilitation of victims. 
 
“We want that aid should come from wherever it can. If the Centre is not ready to give financial aid, or it does not have the money, then we should be allowed to get it from where we are getting it (internationally),” Omar told reporters after donating blood as part of his party’s blood donation camp to mark the first anniversary of the floods here. 
 
Omar, who is working president of opposition National Conference (NC), said people of the state had suffered from both sides, as neither had the Centre given any package nor did it allow any international aid. 
 
“We (the previous NC-Congress government) had started the process of getting international aid by talking to the World Bank. The first meeting, I had with the officials of World Bank and Asian Development Bank before the election code (came into force).” 
 
“We had prepared a project but there has been no forward movement on that as well. So, we suffered from both the sides. Neither did we get anything from here, nor from where we would have got some money,” the former chief minister said. 
 
Terming as “unfortunate” the ruling Peoples’ Democratic Party’s (PDP) decision to celebrate the anniversary of the floods, Omar said, “…The reality is that the people, who were affected by the floods, have got nothing to celebrate.” He said, now, the high court had to take a suo motu notice as a result of “non-efficiency” of this government. 
 
“The court has compelled the state as well as the central government to answer. Now, we hope that due to high court’s pressure, people would get something which these people (governments) were unwilling to give till now. They were not ready to give the people anything on their own. Whatever,I had given to people during my regime, they had got nothing more than that,” the former chief minister said. 
 
Omar claimed whatever assistance the flood-affected people got was before March 1. 
 
“Since the PDP-BJP government was sworn-in (March 1), they (victims) have been continuously neglected. Rs 2000-Rs 2500 crore fund that they got with much difficulty was the money from State Disaster Relief Fund and first instalment from Government of India which was announced on the spot during my regime. Not a penny extra,” he alleged. 
 
The NC leader alleged the Centre took back money which it had given to the state on the account of various expenditures. 
 
“They took money for many things in the name of flood relief. But those, who suffered losses, did not get anything. Helicopters were used, (but) the money was taken from us. Their boats were used here, but the money was taken from us. The funds meant for liabilities under Prime Minister’s Reconstruction Programme were taken in the name of floods. 
 
“Additional special plan assistance, which is given to us by the Planning Commission every year to balance our plan, that money was also added to the flood account and taken. That is why, Mufti sahab felt a compulsion to arrest the leaders of trade bodies who were to protest against the government,” Omar said. 
 
Condemning the arrest of leaders of various trade bodies, he said, the chief minister is the same Sayeed who used to say that this is the battle of ideas, but the reality is, if your ideas do not match his, he will not allow you to talk. 
 
“You (governments) are pushing the people unnecessarily. These traders were not protesting against any country. They were not coming out with anti-national slogans. They were coming out for their rights. 
 
“The rights which they have been promised of by none other than the Prime Minister of the country who, here in Srinagar, said that we will not only give whatever to this part of Kashmir, but are even ready to help the other side of Kashmir as well. 
 
“Thank God, they (Pakistan-occupied Kashmir) did not took the help, otherwise their situation would have been same like ours. It is unfortunate that they (leaders of trade bodies) have been arrested for bringing these things to the public domain,” he said. 
 
Omar, in a series of tweets, termed the chief minister as “dictator” for carrying out midnight raids and arrest of trader body leaders. 
 
“In a series of midnight raids (chief Minister) Mufti (Mohammad) Syed has ensured the arrest of all the Trade Body leaders. Their crime? Unhappiness over flood relief. All these people wanted to do was register their dissatisfaction at the absence of any meaningful flood relief. Shame on Mufti the Dictator,” he tweeted. 
 
“If Mufti Sb (sahab) was so sure people were going to celebrate as his Govt (government) has planned today he wouldn’t have ordered these arrests. #Dictator,” he said.

1863,"L ast fall one of my sons anguished over the price of a $150 textbook for a college calculus class. 
 
He looked for a used version or a rental, to no avail. So he dutifully bought the new book, put it on his desk in his dorm room, and never looked at it again. He used parts of a digital supplement packaged with it. The book, though, still in pristine condition, lies in a bin in his room at home. He wasn’t able to sell it back. 
 
There’s nothing unusual about that story, which makes it all the more disturbing, especially as college costs escalate. I hear similar examples all too frequently from the students I work with. A few semesters ago, a student in one of my classes even asked me outright: ""If I buy this book, will we use it?"" 
 
Federal regulations that took effect in 2010 were intended to provide clarity on textbook costs and, ideally, to make course materials more affordable. The regulations require publishers to disclose prices to faculty members and allow students to purchase books, CDs, and other supplemental material separately rather than as a bundle. The law also requires colleges to provide a list of required books and materials for students when they register for classes. 
 
That approach seems to be working, at least to an extent. Recent data from the National Association of College Stores show that students spent nearly 20 percent less on required course materials in the 2014-15 school year than they did in 2007-8. But that still amounts to $563 for an academic year, with a typical textbook selling for $79 (up from $57 in 2007). 
 
Increasingly, students simply refuse to buy textbooks even if professors require them, which is not surprising. Over the past four years, surveys have found that two-thirds to three-quarters of college students refused to buy textbooks because costs were too high and many instructors used only a few chapters. Others buy bootleg digital copies or photocopy chapters from books that other students have bought. Many alter their class schedules based on the price of textbooks. 
 
So what’s the point of textbooks? I’ve never been a fan of them, either as a student or as a professor. By textbooks, I mean books that survey the breadth of a topic, chapter by boring chapter. They are intended to feed required information to students, not to help them think or learn. As an undergraduate, I found these types of books turgid and pedantic. They offered little in the way of enlightenment. Rather, they felt like punishment. Like students today, I avoided them whenever I could. 
 
All too often, professors use textbooks and lectures in tandem. They start with the book and plan a course around it, picking a chapter here and a chapter there, or simply following along with the author’s outline and instructor’s supplement. Then they assemble students in a lecture and tell them the points of the textbook they should pay attention to. (Or should have paid attention to had they bought the book.) 
 
That approach emphasizes facts over thinking. It looks at information as rare and static rather than abundant and dynamic. The world has moved on from that model. But in far too many cases, education hasn’t, treating students as empty vessels that need filling rather than as distinct individuals who need guidance in learning on their own. It’s an information-first approach rather than a learning-first approach, one that emphasizes the what rather than the how and the why. 
 
I certainly understand textbooks’ attraction for teachers, especially overworked, underpaid adjuncts and graduate students who lack the time and resources to teach any other way. The books provide a ready-made framework for classes. They offer a consistent form of information that instructors can rely on across multiple class sections. They save time by cutting down on the need to constantly search for new material, especially when publishers provide lesson plans, PowerPoint presentations, and quizzes. And yes, even in a world of dynamic information, students need some foundational information and understanding to work with. 
 
So I’m not arguing that textbooks are evil or that instructors who use them are remiss. But here’s what I would like to see teachers do: Before you assign a textbook, check the price. Ask yourself whether students really need it and will truly learn from reading it. Check to see whether an open-source alternative is available. Scour the web and enlist your college’s librarians to find articles and posts that provide the same — or even better — information as in the textbook. Have your students find and recommend readings for your class. Work with colleagues to create a shared pool of effective course materials. Work with your teaching center to improve your approach to using class materials and class time for learning. 
 
In short, work through the decision to assign a textbook as you would a research question: Gather information. Weigh competing options and opinions. Move beyond the obvious. Innovate wherever possible. Revise. Seek feedback from peers. Revise again. Then justify your conclusion in clear, convincing terms. 
 
That’s what you expect your students to do. It’s not easy. But then neither is paying hundreds of dollars a semester for unused textbooks.

3433,"Ange Postecoglou delighted with performance as job done with minimum of fuss   Socceroos vs Bangladesh, by numbers 

Socceroos coach Ange Postecoglou's fears that his team might have been disrupted by the row between the players union and the FFA that had provided much of the mood music in Perth this week proved unfounded after Australia put an outclassed Bangladesh to the sword on a balmy evening in Western Australia. 

The Socceroos ran out 5-0  winners of their second World Cup qualifying match on the road to Russia 2018, Postecoglou springing a surprise by leaving captain and talisman Tim Cahill on the bench. 

For once they didn't need the former Everton man's golden touch as Mat Leckie, Tom Rogic (two), Nathan Burns and Aaron Mooy filled their boots against opponents who might have provided more resistance had both teams changed into cricketing whites and opted to play a Twenty20 match instead. 

Still, home crowds love winners, and at the very least the Socceroos gave a capacity Perth crowd plenty of fond memories to hold on to should there be another ten year gap between international appearances in the city. This was, after all, the first time Australia had played there since defeating Indonesia 3-0 a decade ago. 

As a contest this was all over inside ten minutes. 

By then Australia was already 2-0 up against an opponent whose inadequacies were manifest. 

It was clear that whatever else he was going to get out of this match, Postecoglou wouldn't learn an awful lot he didn't already know about his players ??? aside, perhaps, from their ability to lairise and put on a show with the game won so easily and so early. 

Not that there was a lot of lairising. Postecoglou demands a high-tempo workrate, an energetic pressing game and a ruthless approach to whoever his side his playing, so for him its business as usual no matter the state of the game. 

Any idea that Australia might go soft on their South-East Asian neighbours once the game was effectively settled was quickly dispelled as the men in yellow sought to add to their tally with every forward foray. 

Australia would not have played many more one sided games than this one. Goalkeeper Adam Federici spent most of the first period as the only player in his half of the field, and so keen was he to get a touch of the ball that he was pushing up almost to the half way line. 

His hopes were in vain however, as the Socceroos looked to score every time they got possession. 

This was a perfect opportunity for Tom Rogic to ease himself back into the national team. Making his first appearance since being dumped on the eve of the World Cup through injury, the languid Celtic playmaker needed little encouragement to shake off the disappointment of Brazil and show why such high hopes had been entertained for him. 

He didn't disappoint, netting twice in the first half ??? once from a shot from inside the penalty area, the second from an effort which was deflected in, after which he looked slightly embarrassed. 

But he impressed more with his zest for the contest and his desire to take on opponents and play combination passes with the likes of Massimo Luongo and Aaroon Mooy, the Melbourne City midfielder this time given a chance to start a match. 

In almost every other game he will play Rogic will face sterner opposition, but he showed in the first half how important a creative outlet he can become for the national team if he can remain fit and in form. 

Cahill is a massive presence around this squad, but for once he wasn't needed. In fact Leckie gave a more than passing impersonation of the Socceroo legend, hanging in the air and providing an aerial threat every tme the ball came in high from the flanks. 

Leckie had only ever scored once for Australia going into this game, but he doubled his tally with the Socceroos opening strike in the sixth minute, when he tucked home a shot from a cut back by Luongo. 

He went close on a number of occasions in the opening period with headers and shots, and it was a header from him which led to Australia's fourth goal in the 28th minute as Nathan Burns pounced on the rebound from Leckie's effort after it was fumbled by Bangladesh goalkeeper Sahidul Alam. 

Bangladesh clung on until the interval and Australia failed to add to their tally until just after the hour mark when Mooy unleashed a 20 metre drive which powered past Sahidul to make it five for the night. 

Rogic and Leckie made way for Cahill and exciting youngster Chris Ikonomidis almost immediately, Cahill refusing to take the captain's armband from Mark Milligan, who had worn it in his stead. 

Ikonomdiis nearly got off the mark straight away with a header from a Jason Davidson cross that thumped off the bar. 

But for all of their possession and all of their dominance the Australians could not add to their tally in what was for them a disappointing half compared to the fireworks of the first period. Jackson Irvine, another new face, went close with a header off the woodwork and then blasted just wide, but the 19,495 strong crowd, the biggest ever for a soccer match at nib Stadium, had to be content with their five goal lot. 

Australia will in all probability face a much sterner test in Tajikistan next Tuesday night.",bd0ae4a1-4270-43d6-802a-2a15bdcef040,News,2015-09-03T14:27:38Z,The Land Australia,Socceroos cruise past outclassed Bangladesh,0.0,Blog

(Reuters) - The U.S. national healthcare reform law has extended health insurance coverage to 17.6 million Americans, according to a new government report on Tuesday, up from its previous estimate of 16.4 million. 
 
The number of uninsured has decreased because of changes in the law that allowed young people to stay on their parents' health plans for longer, the expansion of Medicaid in 29 states and the District of Columbia, and the sale of subsidized health insurance to individuals, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a speech.

If you would like to submit a story to this series, click here.  Today’s guest post is by Charity Craig. 
Only minutes after my mother-in-law arrived, there was a knock at the door. She returned, “there’s an officer here to serve you your divorce papers”. The words were the final nail in the coffin. It was over. My marriage was dead. There was nothing left for me to do, but let go, so I did. I began to sob and my mother-in-law just held me. Since I couldn’t pull myself together and the officer wanted to jet all the awkwardness, he served the papers to my mother-in-law. For the first time in my life, I fought for something, and I lost. Exhausted and depleted, I slipped the papers into my top drawer and took off my ring. I would deal with that tomorrow. I felt betrayed even by God. Didn’t he see how hard I had fought for the right thing? Now I had lost everything and didn’t see how he could ever turn something like this into good. I see and know what divorces do to families with children. In a brief moment, in my mind’s eye, it was like the shroud that hides my future was lifted and I could see down the tunnel of my life. An inaudible voice spoke to my heart, “Your good and perfect gift is eternal and I have it waiting for you, but until then you must walk this broken road”. Just like that, my dependence switched from Matt to Christ. Just like that, I gave up the fight to control. So, three days later when the shell of my husband showed up at the door and said he wanted to come back and give us a try, he met a different person. I was done fighting. It was over. He looked at me and said, “I’m sorry I never fought for us. I’m sorry I made you do it alone. You don’t need to fight anymore. I will”. The next several months he did fight, and we began to inch our ways back into the same room of life. I was determined not to put a Jesus Band-aid on the wounds, and Matt gave me permission to hurt. Standing across from Matt I lowered my shield and let him see my bleeding heart. Then, Matt lowered his shield and I was shocked to discover I wasn’t the only one in the room with a mortally wounded heart. Suddenly, “you need to pay for what you did” lost its punch. Over the next year, we’ve learned to take more risks with our own hearts, but be more tender with each other’s. We’ve practiced saying, “I forgive you” and “I love you” to each other and ourselves. This past weekend we celebrated our 10-year anniversary. We stayed in the nicest suite one night could buy here in town, and after enjoying free food and drinks in the concierge lounge we wandered down to the lobby lounge where Tom was singing classic songs. Matt gave a request and as Tom began to sing, Georgia on My Mind, Matt did the one thing he knew I’ve always longed to do; Matt pulled me up and danced with me while no one else danced. As Matt held me close, my heart was full. Tom finished his tune, thanked us for dancing, and then he said, “Let’s applaud this couple. That’s a couple in love”. Suddenly, everyone was applauding and looking at us. But what no one in that lounge realized, they were really applauding proof that there’s life after death.",98699d61-00cb-423f-8851-e83b348cc845,Blog,2015-09-23T13:00:00Z,Rage Against the Minivan,What I want you to know about reviving a dead marriage,1.0,News

2907,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Kerry Simon, a former ""Iron Chef"" champ who served up dishes to rock bands such as Led Zeppelin and Mötley Crüe, has died.

Simon died Friday morning at a hospice facility in Las Vegas, according to his business partner, Cory Harwell.

He was 60.

Simon was diagnosed with Multiple System Atrophy, a degenerative neurological disorder, and died from complications related to the disease.

Harwell, who met Simon in 2009, said he did not let his disorder keep him from doing what he wanted to, which was open restaurants. Simon operated restaurants at several Las Vegas hotels including Palms Place and Harrah's. He and Harwell formed their own restaurant-hospitality management group in 2013 and opened four restaurants together with a fifth one still on the horizon.

Even with the loss of his motor skills, Simon continued carrying out his vision for a planned fifth restaurant.

""He ate everything and made suggestions and comments and fixes,"" Harwell said. ""I learned more from him in the past two and a half years than a lifetime of working in and out of kitchens. I'll cherish that forever.""

Known as the ""rock 'n' roll chef,"" Simon appeared on ""Iron Chef America"" in 2005 and beat Cat Cora in a hamburger challenge.

He first made a name for himself at age 34 as an executive chef at The Plaza Hotel in New York City, according to his company's website.

He gained a reputation for feeding some of the most famous names in the music world including Alice Cooper and the band Cheap Trick. But he loved to cook for anyone, Harwell said.

""An average Joe, he would treat the exact same way,"" Harwell said. ""There was no pretention.""

Simon is survived by three brothers.

Funeral services have not been set.

3409,"NSW: A Syrian refugee has opened up about the fear that forced him to leave his home country. A Syrian refugee has opened up about the fear that forced him to leave his home country. Muhammad Hussain, who now lives in Griffith with fellow refugee Zahid Hussain, recounted the many horrors he saw in his home country.

“(It’s) very dangerous (in Syria), every morning, every afternoon, every night, killing,” Muhammad said. “You sleep and when you wake up you look at the road at all the killing.”

After leaving Syria, Muhammad’s house was torched by insurgents.

Muhammad said there were mass murders in towns where in excess of 300 people were put into a single grave.

He has not heard from his father in four years but holds onto hope that he is alive.

“The first time I go to Pakistan because my father tell me ‘you go because I’m scared (for your safety). You go to Pakistan, look around Pakistan and see if you can live (there)’ but after this I come (to Australia),” Muhammad said.

“I was born in Syria, my father lived there for 35, 40 years. For four years, I don't know where he is.”

Muhammad fled Syria to Pakistan in 2012 before he came to Australia in October the same year.

His wife, daughter, brother and sisters still reside in Pakistan. Muhammad’s daughter was just seven months old when he left his family.

He is able to contact his family on the phone but hasn't seen anyone since he has been in Australia.

He hopes one day he will be able to visit neighbouring countries of Pakistan and Syria to visit his family.

One of his biggest fears is his daughter rejecting him as her father after living apart for so long.

“I only stay home, go outside, go back, it’s no life,” Muhammad said. “Mentally, every night it’s tough. When I stay here, I think about my family.

“My daughter when I left (Syria) was seven months old, now she’s four. When I talk with her she does not talk with me. We talk very little, hi, how are you, that’s all.”

Along with his family, Muhammad left behind a house and a business. He said he is stuck in limbo – not being able to work or study – and struggles to support his family.

He wants to see the government provide more support for refugees.

2545,"I just got home from an amazing trip to Beaver Creek, Colorado. 4 days up in the mountains at an amazing resort working on business and working on self with my Mastermind Group. My spirit and energy are feeling refreshed, rejuvenated, reenergized and raring to go. 
 
It was a special time up in the Rockies. We had approximately 70 fit pros from the TD Mastermind up in the mountains for our annual Fall Retreat. Besides these guys and gals coming from all over the country, we had one fit pro in from Australia (Scott Rawcliffe), one from Kuwait (Omar AlHamad), and one couple from north of the border (Duncan & Jenn Waller, Vancouver, CA).  The rest of the folks were from all over the country. 
 
While I have the opportunity to work with these great folks and the rest of their Mastermind teammates on a regular basis (on-line/virtually), there is NOTHING like a live meeting when we are all together. LIVE connect time is always BEST. 
 
The theme of our retreat this Fall was “ DREAM the imPOSSIBLE .”  I challenged the Mastermind attendees to dream big. And to put pen to paper as I facilitated some deep personal development & business exercises over 2-days. It went deep. 
 
I also shared my dreams. I shared my BHAG’s (big hairy audacious goals). I shared my best practices. And I shared what is most moving my soul today. 
 
And I encouraged them to do the same. We had time to write.To journal. To listen. To be inspired. 
 
And we took time to work-out. To swim. To hike. To get massages. And go in the hot tub. 
 
And we had time to DREAM. 
 

 
This week, the WOW is DREAM. 
 
You don’t need to go to a world-class resort like the Westin Riverfront Spa & Resort to DREAM (although it doesn’t hurt!  ). 
 
You can dream by: 
  Taking 10-20 minutes in the AM to journal and write down your DREAMS.  Getting out and going for a walk or run and listening to an inspirational podcast.  Visiting your local beach, nature-trail, mountain, or park and getting an outdoor workout.  Writing down your BIG 5 for Life & your BIG 5 for the Year . Your BIG 5 for Life ware the 5 things you want to achieve in your life. Your BIG 5 for the Year are the 5 things you want to achieve in the next year.   
Lastly, never underestimate the power of 2 more things: 
 
1.  Immersing yourself in a magical environment . When you put yourself in a “world-class” environment, it affects your mindset. You think world-class, you are exposed to world-class, and you THINK world-class. This can be at a resort, destination spot, or even a gym (like Fitness Quest 10  ). But seriously, this environment can be anywhere. It can be your home, your garden, or somewhere “simple” that stirs your spirit and moves your soul. 
 
2.  Surround yourself with “world-class” people. The folks in the Mastermind are world-class people. When I’m at Fitness Quest 10, the people are world-class, both teammates and clients. IT MATTERS! Who you put yourself around matters. Who your kids hang out with matters. Who YOU hang-out with matters. So spend more time with people thatbring out the BEST in you. And that support your dreams and visions. 
 
My friends, DREAM this week. Eat well. Train hard. Surround yourself with people that inspire you. Listen or read messages that inspireyou. Eliminate “head trash” and junk in your life that is holding you back. 
 
And go out and be the BEST that you can be. Dream big this week and take action steps that will massively support your dream to happen. #IWILL 
 
Much love…and many DREAMS. 
 
Todd

Why are the global elite buying extremely remote compounds that come with their own private airstrips in the middle of nowhere on the other side of the planet?  And why did they start dumping stocks like crazy earlier this year?  Do they know something that the rest of us don’t?   The things that I am about to share with you are quite alarming.  It appears that the global elite have a really good idea of what is coming, and they have already taken substantial steps to prepare for it.  Sadly, most of the general population is absolutely clueless about the financial collapse that is about to take place, and thus most of them will be completely blindsided by it . 
 
As I discussed the other day , the only way that you make money in the stock market is if you get out in time.  The elite understand this very well, and that is why they have been dumping stocks for months.  This is something that has even been reported in the mainstream news.  For example, this comes from a CNBC article that was published on June 16th … 
 
The so-called smart money is pulling back from market risk, with fund managers taking down exposure to stocks , increasing cash holdings and buying protection against a sharp selloff . 
  
About two weeks before that, I discussed the same phenomenon on my website.  The article that I published on May 30th was entitled “ Why Is The Smart Money Suddenly Getting Out Of Stocks And Real Estate? ” 
 
Did the “smart money” know what was about to happen?  Since the peak of the market, the Dow has already lost more than 2200 points .  All of the gains since the end of the 2013 calendar year have already been completely wiped out. 
 
And of course the truth is that you didn’t really need any inside information to see that it was time to get out.  I have been warning my readers for months about what was coming.  The signs have been clear as a bell if you were willing to look at them.  Just consider the following excerpt from a recent piece  by Michael Pento … 
 
Earlier in the year margin debt had risen over $30 billion or 6.5% to $507 billion and was equal to a record 2.87% of U.S. GDP . This surpasses the previous all-time high of 2.78% set in March 2000 – the top of the last largest stock market bubble in history . 
 
And despite the assurance of every mutual fund manager on TV that they have boatloads of cash ready to deploy at these “discounted” levels, in early August cash levels at mutual funds sank to their lowest level in history , 3.2% (see chart below). As a percentage of stock market capitalization, fund cash levels are also nearing the record low set in 2000 when the NASDAQ peaked and subsequently crashed by around 80% . 
  
The financial markets are absolutely primed for a major crash, and when that happens many among the elite will be hightailing it to the middle of nowhere. 
 
Earlier this year, the Mirror published an article all about this entitled “ Panicked super rich buying boltholes with private airstrips to escape if poor rise up “.   Here is a brief excerpt… 
 
Robert Johnson, president of the Institute of New Economic Thinking, told people at the World Economic Forum in Davos that many hedge fund managers were already planning their escapes. 
 
He said: “I know hedge fund managers all over the world who are buying airstrips and farms in places like New Zealand because they think they need a getaway.” 
  
Keep in mind that these are not just some rumors that Robert Johnson has heard.  These are people that he knows personally and that he interacts with regularly. 
 
And Robert Johnson was not alone in this assessment.  Here is more  from the Mirror … 
 
His comments were backed up by Stewart Wallis, executive director of the New Economics Foundation, who when asked about the comments told CNBC Africa: “Getaway cars, the airstrips in New Zealand and all that sort of thing, so basically a way to get off. 
 
“If they can get off, onto another planet, some of them would.” 
  
For some reason, the global elite seem to have a particular affinity for New Zealand.   Perhaps it is because of the great natural beauty of the nation combined with the fact that it is in the middle of nowhere.  The following comes from  the Daily Mail … 
 
New Zealand , which is about the size of the UK, but has a population of just 4.4 million, offers them all the modern luxuries they have come to expect – but miles from any country which may implode into chaos . 
 
The country is 11,658 miles away from the UK, while its closest neighbour is Fiji – 1,612 miles away, more than double the distance between Lands End and John O’Groats. 
 
Homes at the top end of the market come with tennis courts, swimming pools and media rooms – and some even boast their own personal jetties where a family can moor their boat. 
 
But the icing on the cake for those looking to make a quick escape comes in the form of private helipads or, better, your own airstrip . 
  
For most of us, buying a luxury bolthole with a private airstrip in New Zealand is not a possibility. 
 
But we should all be getting prepared. 
 
I have a contact in the food industry that has told me that her company’s sales have “been through the roof” over the past 10 days as people stock up for what is coming.  In fact, she even used the word “panic” to describe what was happening. 
 
And Americans have been buying a record number of guns  as well … 
 
Newly released August records show that the FBI posted 1.7 million background checks required of gun purchasers at federally licensed dealers, the highest number recorded in any August since gun checks began in 1998 . The numbers follow new monthly highs for June (1.5 million) and July (1.6 million), a period which spans a series of deadly gun attacks — from Charleston to Roanoke — and proposals for additional firearm legislation. 
  
For a very long time, I have been warning people to get prepared. 
 
Well, now we are getting so close that panic is starting to set in. 
 
Hopefully you are already well prepared for what is about to happen.  If not, you need to kick your prepping into overdrive . 
 
These next few months are going to change everything.  Get ready while you still can.",8bee571d-7414-4cf0-9828-84de660986a6,News,2015-09-07T16:10:23Z,Zero Hedge,The Elite Have Prepared For The Coming Collapse – Have You?,0.0,Blog
2774,"The Gantt Report By Lucius Gantt 
 
Frederick Douglass once said, “You can’t get crops without plowing the land”. Samora Machel said, “You can’t get tea without boiling the water”. And, The Gantt Report has written on numerous occasions that “You can’t get wine without stomping the grapes”! 
 
Well, some say Lucius Gantt is all of that, a plower, a boiler and someone that will figuratively and, in a literal sense, stomp the life out of a devilish beast! 
 
In my mind, all I am is someone that cares. I am not afraid to stand up and speak about issues that are important to me, my people and my community. 
 
I would imagine that I have a whole lot of enemies. I say imagine because my enemies never step up and tell me that but I’m smart enough to know I have enemies and so does everyone that took the time to read this column. 
 
An enemy is someone that wishes to injure you in some way, a foe or someone that may be hostile to your idea, your cause or to your people. 
 
Your enemy doesn’t want you to improve, doesn’t want you to progress and doesn’t want you to thrive! Your enemy wants to put you in check, keep you weak, hold you down, exploit you, oppress you and subjugate you. 
 
The worst kind of enemy is a hater. They hate the truth, hate how you act, hate how you talk, hate your family, hate your friends and hate what is important to you and what you believe in. 
 
Some haters are “frienemies” or people that pretend to be your friend but are really your enemy. A frienemy claims to know everything about you. They pose as your redeemer, act like they are your supporter, suggest that they are your benefactor and pretend to be your ally. The haters claim to know your flaws, your faults, your errors, your mistakes, your shortcomings, your weaknesses and your fears but if they would just look into a mirror they would see those things in themselves! 
 
Don’t be scared of your enemies. If you live clean and let your works be seen your enemies won’t be able to kill you, hurt you or stop you! 
 
When your enemies look to harm you personally, professionally, spiritually or in other ways, if you’re a good man or a good woman you will be protected! 
 
When your enemies try to cut you off, shut you down, destroy your marriages and relationships, get you fired, try to put you out of business, success is always the best revenge! 
 
The best way to quiet a hater is to do what you do and be very good at it. 
 
When you survive hate, when you defeat your enemies and become successful in spite of those persons with devilish intent and wicked ways, the table is being prepared! 
 
When the Bible says God will prepare a table for you in the presence of your enemies it encourages you to be strong, be brave and to tell your haters and enemies to their face to kiss your booty! 
 
They can try to knock you down but they can never knock you out!  ( Buy Gantt’s latest book, Beast Too: Dead Man Writing on Amazon.com and from bookstores everywhere. Contact Lucius at www.allworldconsultants.net. And if you want to, “Like” The Gantt Report page on Facebook.)

SHARE THIS ARTICLERight now the third-generation Toyota Prius is essentially in its final days.
We've known it was rounding a bend not too long ago, but now we're finally seeing its replacement, the fourth-generation Prius. If we're honest, the jury is still out on it. 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show (IAA)
Although Toyota has promised it will be a nice evolutionary step from the third-gen product, one thing's for sure: it certainly will feature a revolutionary design. Not just on the outside, either. Looking inside, the cabin is changing in a BIG way. Toyota said in its initial press release that the fourth-gen Prius would benefit from a more luxurious cabin equipped with better materials. But, that's looking harder to believe thanks to Agent 001's detailed photographs. What I will say, however, is that it appears there are quite a lot of screens to display information on. Seen for the very first time, 001 went through the cabin and leafed through its screens to show YOU what you can expect once this vehicle arrives in showrooms. After you scope out the images below, let us know if you think the interior on the fourth-gen Prius is a STUD or a DUD.

2962,"WASHINGTON , Sept. 8, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Fannie Mae's Economic & Strategic Research Group today launched the Fannie Mae Home Purchase Sentiment Index ™ (HPSI), which distills results from its consumer-focused National Housing Survey ™ (NHS) into a single, monthly, predictive indicator. Reflecting more than four years of data, the HPSI is designed to provide distinct signals about the direction of the housing market, helping industry participants to make better informed business decisions. 

Unlike existing general indices of consumer economic sentiment, the HPSI is devoted entirely to housing. The index is constructed from answers to six key NHS questions that solicit Americans' evaluations of housing market conditions and address topics related to their home purchase decisions. These questions ask consumers whether they think it is a good or bad time to buy or to sell a house, the direction they expect home prices and mortgage interest rates to move, how concerned they are about losing their jobs, and whether their incomes are higher than they were a year earlier. The Economic & Strategic Research Group expects to release the HPSI at 8:30 a.m., ET on the seventh day of each month or the first business day afterward. 
   
""The Fannie Mae Home Purchase Sentiment Index provides the market a single number to track consumer attitudes focused on the housing market,"" said Doug Duncan , senior vice president and chief economist at Fannie Mae. ""Utilizing our National Housing Survey, the only consumer sentiment survey of its kind focused on housing, the HPSI will offer insights regarding current and future-looking housing market outcomes and will complement existing data sources to inform housing-related analysis."" 

""Consumer attitudes toward the current home selling climate have slid back to their April 2015 level, contributing to a slight decline in the August HPSI reading relative to its four-year high, reached two months ago,"" said Duncan. ""Expectations of rising mortgage rates and increasing concerns in the last six months about the direction of the economy seem to be weighing on consumers' assessment of the housing market. Those who think it's a good time to buy or sell a home have consistently pointed to favorable mortgage rates as the primary reason for their optimism. Those who think it's a bad time to buy or sell a home have consistently pointed to unfavorable economic conditions as the primary reason for their pessimism. Still, the four-year upward trend in the HPSI indicates that consumers remain fairly optimistic about the housing market."" 

HOME PURCHASE SENTIMENT INDEX – COMPONENT HIGHLIGHTS 
The August 2015 HPSI fell 0.5 points to 80.8 , continuing the decline from the all-time high reached in June 2015 . The HPSI is up 5.3 points since this time last year. On net, two components of the HPSI improved in August, with Confidence About Not Losing Job increasing 3 points and Good Time to Sell increasing 1 point. Home Price and Mortgage Rate net expectations both fell 3 points since last month. 
The percent of respondents who said that it is a good time to buy a house rose to 63%, rising 2 percentage points from last month's all-time survey low. Those who say it is a good time to sell rose 2 percentage points to 47%. The percent of respondents who say it is a bad time to sell also increased to 44%. The percent of respondents who said that home prices will go up over the next 12 months fell to 47%. The percent who said that home prices will go down rose to 9%. The share who expect mortgage interest rates to go up in the next 12 months rose 3 percentage points to 54%. The share who say mortgage rates will go down remained the same at 5%. The share of respondents who say they are not concerned with losing their job rose to 83%, while the share of respondents who say they are concerned with losing their job fell to 16%. The share of respondents who say their household income is significantly higher than it was 12 months ago fell to 24%, while those who say it is significantly lower fell to 12%. 
ABOUT THE FANNIE MAE HOME PURCHASE SENTIMENT INDEX 

The Fannie Mae Home Purchase Sentiment Index ™ (HPSI) distills information about consumers' home purchase sentiment from the Fannie Mae National Housing Survey ™ (NHS) into a single number. The HPSI reflects current and forward-looking housing market outcomes and complements existing data sources to inform housing related analysis and decision making. The HPSI is constructed from answers to six NHS questions that solicit consumers' evaluations of housing market conditions and address topics that are related to their home purchase decisions. The questions ask consumers whether they think that it is a good or bad time to buy or to sell a house, what direction they expect home prices and mortgage interest rates to move, how concerned they are about losing their jobs, and whether their incomes are higher than they were a year earlier. 

The six questions of the Home Purchase Sentiment Index include: 
In general, do you think this is a very good time to buy a house , a somewhat good time, a somewhat bad time, or a very bad time to buy a house? In general, do you think this is a very good time to sell a house , a somewhat good time, a somewhat bad time, or a very bad time to buy a house? During the next 12 months, do you think home prices in general will go up, go down, or stay the same as where they are now? During the next 12 months, do you think home mortgage interest rates will go up, go down, or stay the same as where they are now? How concerned are you that you will lose your job in the next twelve months? Are you very concerned, somewhat concerned, not very concerned, or not at all concerned that you will lose your job in the next twelve months? How does your current monthly household income compare to what it was twelve months ago? 
ABOUT THE FANNIE MAE NATIONAL HOUSING SURVEY 


The most detailed consumer attitudinal survey of its kind, Fannie Mae's National Housing Survey ™ polled 1,000 Americans via live telephone interview to assess their attitudes toward owning and renting a home, home and rental price changes, homeownership distress, the economy, household finances, and overall consumer confidence. Homeowners and renters are asked more than 100 questions used to track attitudinal shifts, six of which are used to construct the HPSI (findings are compared to the same survey conducted monthly beginning June 2010 ). To reflect the growing share of households with a cell phone but no landline, the National Housing Survey has increased its cell phone dialing rate to 60 percent as of October 2014 . For more information, please see the Technical Notes . Fannie Mae conducts this survey and shares monthly and quarterly results so that we may help industry partners and market participants target our collective efforts to stabilize the housing market in the near-term, and provide support in the future. The August 2015 National Housing Survey was conducted between August 1, 2015 and August 24, 2015 . Most of the data collection occurred during the first two weeks of this period. Interviews were conducted by Penn Schoen Berland, in coordination with Fannie Mae.

640,"England have named an unchanged starting XV for Friday's World Cup opener against Fiji at Twickenham. 
 
		 
The only adjustment to the 23 that dispatched Ireland 21-13 nine days ago sees hooker Rob Webber replace Jamie George on a bench that includes rugby league convert Sam Burgess. 
  Courtney Lawes will partner Geoff Parling in the second row for England's Rugby World Cup opener against Fiji.   
Courtney Lawes has been chosen to partner line-out specialist Geoff Parling in the second row once again and Ben Morgan continues to be preferred to Billy Vunipola, who is selected among the replacements. 

			 
The final marginal call faced by head coach Stuart Lancaster was on the wings where Jonny May and Anthony Watson will start, keeping Jack Nowell out of the 23 for a second game. 



 
Scrum-half Ben Youngs, one of seven survivors from the 2011 World Cup, will win his 50th cap when Fiji visit Twickenham. 

Lancaster insists England are thrilled at the prospect of playing a World Cup on home soil and welcomes the ""support of a nation"" for his team. 

""The squad is massively excited to start the World Cup. Everyone has worked incredibly hard over the last three months and we are ready,"" he said. 

""All the players have put their hand up in training and during the internationals we have played this summer. 

			 
""We are blessed to have such a strong squad to select from against a skilful and powerful Fijian side. 

""Friday will be a great occasion for the whole squad and for the country. We are in a unique position to be playing in a World Cup on home soil and to have the support of a nation behind the team. 

""That support will be a massive factor and we don't underestimate its importance. 

""I'd like to congratulate Ben Youngs on his achievement. To win 50 caps for your country in such a relatively short period of time is testament to Ben's dedication and commitment.""

129,"Tim Ernst grew up in Williamsville playing video games like “Mega Man” and “The Legend of Zelda” on his console, and “Ultima” and “Warcraft”... Read…  
Tim Ernst grew up in Williamsville playing video games like “Mega Man” and “The Legend of Zelda” on his console, and “Ultima” and “Warcraft” on his computer. 

“I loved them. They were something I just saw so much potential in,” Ernst said. “It was always heartbreaking to play a game that was terrible. And if you played one that was amazing, it was just an unbelievable experience. 

” 

Today, he gets to play – and design, and develop – video games for a living. Ernst, 34, is general manager of Kabam Games, where he oversees about 100 employees in the company’s San Francisco development studio. 

He’s playing a leading role in the company’s latest mobile game, “Star Wars: Uprising,” which came out Thursday and is tied to the eagerly awaited next installment in the “Star Wars” movie franchise, set for release in December. 

Kabam has found a niche in making interactive, role-playing games for smartphones and tablets. The games are free to download and play but offer users the chance to pay for additional items within the game. 

It’s one segment of the massive, highly competitive video-game market, in which Ernst got his start with an internship at Ubisoft while studying at Yale University. He later worked at Sega of America and Bedlam Games before joining Kabam four years ago. 

The Canisius High School graduate spoke to The News during a recent trip to Western New York, where he visited family and tried to squeeze in stops at Duff’s Famous Wings, Gabriel’s Gate, Mighty Taco, Wegmans and other hometown favorites. 

Q: Is making video games work? 

A: Clearly we’re not just playing games. We, to a certain extent, do rocket science inside of video games. But it’s sure enjoyable – it’s an industry full of passionate people. 

Q: Kabam’s niche is in role-playing games, or RPGs, for mobile devices. What are they? 

A: A role-playing game is really a video game world. It’s got to be complete, with people you talk to, a story. But your character, your customization, your choices, as well as how you interact with both people in the game, and other people playing the game, is what makes the genre unique. 

Q: Are role-playing games a small part of the market compared to console and PC games? 

A: No, it is it not a small segment of the overall industry. In fact, multiple games last year made over $1 billion themselves. So, there has been success. And the people that have been successful have stayed at the top for a long period of time. It’s also a growth market because of international – specifically China. China’s a huge market that console games, traditional games, have not been able to break into. 

Q: How do you provide the immersed gaming experience you get from playing on a desktop or console to people playing on their phones? 

A: That’s one of the things that we’re trying to pioneer. We just released a game seven months ago called “Marvel: Contest of Champions,” which is a fighting game that had some light story elements. And really it’s about making it a game – it’s not a mobile game being an apology. So we’re trying to push more the true, classic video game experiences inside of a phone. And that does mean that if we’re making an RPG (role playing game), we have to tell our story a little differently – our pacing’s very different. 

Q: “Star Wars: Uprising” will be free to download and play. How does Kabam make money through the game? 

A: The basis of free to play is everybody can download it because we want as many people as possible to start playing it. And, really, the core of free play is being able to offer people what we call “pay against the grind.” So if you want to do something in the game, and it’s going to take you a couple of extra hours – it’s not like a timer, but let’s say I have to run 10 dungeons – there’s a route to kind of make that a lot shorter. It’s optional. 

Q: How does the game fit within the “Star Wars” storyline? 

A: “Star Wars: Uprising” is set in the Anoat Sector, which you could call the “Empire Strikes Back” sector. So it’s Hoth, Cloud City, the planets around there. And it’s right after “Return of the Jedi.” So this is time that nobody has explored in games. Basically, after the emperor, Death Star II, and the emperor is killed, the governor of the system, Governor Adelhard, basically puts an iron blockade down. Now, he’s an imperialist. He believes that what the Empire’s doing is truly great for the galaxy. And he puts a blockade that prevents trade, that prevents rebel propaganda. But ultimately you’re pushing back against Adelhard’s iron blockade. And there’s five factions. The Rebel Alliance is one of the factions. 

Q: Is it completely open-ended, or is there a way to win the game? 

A: I don’t know that there’s winning, because it’s a living world. But clearly you want to win, you want to beat the Empire. And we don’t really look at it as just a game or a packaged product. This is a service, and we want to create the Star Wars community, the place for everyone to live their “Star Wars” dream. So how you push back against the Empire is part of the game, and one of the parts that will evolve. And as the community reacts, t…",09344ca2-fdcc-4de3-9424-1b201e3da9ea,News,2015-09-13T02:09:48Z,MyInforms,A video game fan brings ‘Star Wars’ to your smartphone,0.0,News
1246,"Provides a fast, cost-effective way to transform content from IBM i applications for web, mobile and email 
 
PETERBOROUGH, NH – September 7, 2015 – SoftLanding® Systems, the IBM i software division of UNICOM® Global, today announced the launch of an enterprise content management solution that quickly transforms existing system output from IBM i business applications to work with digital channels such as the web, mobile and email. 
 
The Columbus software, developed by Macro 4, the specialist document management division of UNICOM Global, is now available for the IBM i platform as part of the SoftLanding solution portfolio. 
 
Columbus unlocks access to a wide variety of business content to improve service, raise productivity and enhance collaboration. The software can be implemented on IBM Power Systems running IBM i, AIX or Linux, without disrupting existing IT systems or applications and requires no specialist development skills. With Columbus, IBM i users can have new digital initiatives up and running in a matter of weeks. 
 
“Many enterprises find adapting core business applications to work with new digital channels highly complex and time consuming,” said Jim Fisher, SoftLanding Operations Manager. “Through Columbus, we now offer a simpler, more cost-effective approach that involves no changes to your IT systems or IBM i applications. The software transforms your existing output – including spool and data files – into new, enhanced digital formats to support initiatives such as eInvoicing and customer self-service, without impacting on existing operations.” 
 
Columbus is a system that takes output from existing applications, automatically transforms it into new digital formats – with the ability to enhance the look of newly formatted documents – and presents it within an in-built online portal. The portal permits secure web and mobile access for an organization’s internal staff, customers and business partners. 
 
“Using Columbus, you can web enable existing invoices, statements and delivery notes for eInvoicing, for example, without having to overhaul the existing IBM i finance applications,” said Fisher. “To improve customer service, a wide range of customer documents can be made accessible online – both to internal staff, and externally to support customer self-service. Business reports and ERP documents can also be turned into new digital formats, allowing wider access to enterprise information both to improve collaboration and to help streamline processes.” 
 
Visitors to the International i-Power Conference (in the UK on 9-10 September 2015) will be able to see demonstrations of the Columbus software on the SoftLanding Systems stand. 
 
More information about Columbus for IBM i users can be found on the SoftLanding website. 
 
SoftLanding’s IBM i products and solutions are commercially available through UNICOM Global’s UNICOM Systems and Macro 4 divisions.

In years past, I allowed my buddy talk me into purchasing a lower priced Simmons scope over the more costly Bushnell Elite I wanted.Ultimately, that ended up being a very poor choice on my part as the scope I bought turned out to be very poor when compared to one I genuinely wanted.

3463,"In 1984, Arizona State University’s Department of Journalism and Telecommunication was elevated from department to school status and named the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Telecommunication. In 2006, PBS’ American Masters profiled the namesake CBS newsman as a “Witness to History.” Tomorrow night, at the outset of this new school year, the twain shall meet in the form of a screening of the PBS documentary as part of “Cronkite Night at the Movies.” The Sept. 2 kick-off selection will be introduced by Cronkite School senior associate dean Marianne Barrett and faculty professor Louise Solheim. When Cronkite passed away in 2009, PBS chatted with the documentary’s director, Catherine Tatge. Among her observations: Q: What did you learn from interviewing Cronkite’s contemporaries? A: A really important point in this documentary is how reporters like Cronkite, and all the other greats I interviewed, were mostly people who came out of print journalism. They were real reporters. And that transition from print to television gave them an understanding of how to find and present a great story. Their print background is reflected in the language they use in their reporting. There’s real writing there. These days, the news media often has to remind readers that so-and-so is not Walter Cronkite. To wit: “Jorge Ramos Is Not Walter Cronkite” “Megyn Kelly Is Not Walter Cronkite” Correct, and correct. There was, and only ever will be, one.

Wellstat Therapeutics has announced that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review the New Drug Application (NDA) for uridine triacetate as an antidote for patients at risk of serious toxicity following an overdose of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and patients who exhibit serious toxicity within 96 hours of being treated with 5-FU. 
 
Overexposure to 5-FU can occur if the drug has been administered at a dose or rate greater than intended, or when a patient has genetic variations, impaired clearance or other biochemical factors that increase sensitivity to the drug. Serious, sometimes life-threatening, 5-FU toxicity has occurred in an estimated 10-20% of patients treated with 5-FU. Administration of uridine triacetate can reduce the ability of toxic 5-FU metabolites to incorporate into the genetic material of healthy cells, enabling cellular recovery after overexposure to 5-FU and preventing cell death. 
 
RELATED: First Drug for Hereditary Orotic Aciduria Approved 
 
In 2009, the FDA granted uridine triacetate Orphan Drug status as an antidote for 5-FU poisoning. Under an expanded access protocol and under FDA emergency treatment provisions, uridine triacetate is currently provided to patients at risk of excess 5-FU toxicity due to overdose and patients exhibiting serious toxicities to 5-FU within 96 hours of 5-FU administration.

2318,"With the burning wreckage of both Mortal Kombat X and Batman: Arkham Knight’s PC ports still pumping smoke into the skies, I’d started to wonder whether WB had it in them to release a competent PC game again. And with Mad Max review codes delayed until launch day, I’d pretty much written it off as another disaster.

Not so! I haven’t ran through a huge chunk of Mad Max yet, but from what little I’ve played it appears to be both stunningly competent and well-optimized. I’ve been at PAX so I don’t have a decent desktop rig nearby to test it on, but I managed to eke out a solid 45+ frames per second at High settings even on the old Blade Pro’s GTX 860M.

Steam reviews seem to concur, with reports of 60+ frames per second at Ultra on a 660 Ti and 100+ frames per second (presumably on Ultra) on a 980/980 Ti. And I’m not seeing widespread reports of problems with AMD hardware, so hopefully that means Team Red is on par with Nvidia for this launch.

Now, whether the game itself is any good? I don’t know. What I’ve played so far feels like a pretty standard open-world game with a Mad Max twist which is…well, pretty much exactly what I expected. But we’ll have a more comprehensive review as soon as we’re able, if you want to hold off.

Either way, props to Avalanche for putting out a PC game that actually works as advertised on launch day, and doing it under the WB umbrella no less. Hopefully this bodes well for Just Cause 3’s December launch also.",7e1df36c-0c7f-4ffe-b75c-53270c2fe8f6,News,2015-09-02T02:02:28Z,Computerworld Singapore,Witness: The Mad Max game runs well on PCs,0.0,News
1231,"UPDATED Uber says Melbourne protests are being led by investors not taxi drivers. 

Uber has hit back at claims that its entry into Australia is hurting taxi drivers and small investors who hold taxi plates.

To get more Money more often, why not follow us on Twitter? We’re @FairfaxMoney 

Taxi drivers have been protesting in Melbourne this morning but the anger is felt by the taxi industry across the country. Some drivers say that they find it hard to compete with ride-sharing in their own cars. And investors who have put their life savings into owning taxi plates have seen their stakes shrink.

But despite the protests, Uber is bullish about its operations.

A spokesperson said: ""The leaders of these protests are taxi investors, not drivers.""

""These same investors are the ones who have kept drivers' wages low and working conditions poor for decades before Uber arrived.

""Instead of improving their own business, these plate owners are blaming others,"" the spokesperson said.

Uber is not to blame for taxi drivers' poor working conditions and taxi industry data shows that ""the taxi market has grown since Uber arrived,"" the spokesperson said.

One Brisbane taxi driver, Ross, who recently contacted Money, said he gets upset with ride-sharing because people do not understand the costs that go into a taxi.

There are the cameras that taxis have to have and car insurance of $6000 a year and ""security"" fees of $600 a year. And that is before the taxi driver put the keys into the ignition.

He said he has just put a new Toyota Aurion on the road at a cost of $46,000 and in Brisbane you see old Corollas being used for ride-sharing.

An older reader from NSW who does not want to be identified said he and his wife bought a taxi plate so that they would not have to go on to the pension.

But the value of the investment has fallen due to ride-sharing.

The retirees first bought a taxi plate in 2006 and it was worth about $440,000 in 2008. He reckons it is now worth about $320,000 or less because of ride-sharing.

Uber 

""It is an illegal taxi service that should be banned in this state as it has been in many cities and states of the world,"" he said.

Data supplied to Money by Uber shows that about 30 per cent of Victorian taxi plate holders actually drive their own taxi, the rest are owned by a few big investors, some of whom hold hundreds of licences.

In NSW about one-quarter of taxi plate holders actually operate their taxi, almost half are held by those who own more than one and some investors hold over 300.

The Uber spokesperson said the time has come for political leaders to implement sensible, safety-based ride-sharing regulation as quickly as possible.

The 17-year-old Grafton High School student was driving north on Ramornie Station Rd sometime before 6.40pm on Tuesday, when the vehicle she was driving left the roadway and crashed into a tree. 
 
The passenger of the Toyota Rav 4, an 18-year-old girl, was treated at the scene by paramedics before being taken to Grafton Base Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. 
 
Police said findings from a forensic assessment would be passed down to the coroner, but no suspicious circumstances had been identified.

Friend JoJo Newby said she was devastated to wake up to the news yesterday morning. 
 
""Kiara was one of those people who added a little warmth to everyone's life,"" she said. 
 
""I went to Pony Club with her as a kid and she would rock up on these rough looking bush horses and then out-ride everyone there... always with a grin on her face. 
 
""She was a modest, warm, kind-hearted kid and as she grew up nothing much changed. The Joe family are the nicest, most generous kind of people you could ever hope to meet. 
 
""It's just heartbreaking to think that something like this has happened to such an incredibly wonderful family."" 
 
A statement from Grafton High School revealed counselling has been arranged for students and staff, and will continue as necessary. 
 
""The school extends its deepest sympathy to the family and friends of Kiara Joe, who died in a tragic road accident overnight,"" it read.

2666,"Leading entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter has said it is time for Scotland to ""move on"" from last year's independence referendum.

The Sports Division founder said politicians must respect the result of the vote - in which Scots voted by 55% to 45% to stay in the UK - as he called on party rivals to unite and ""focus upon building a more prosperous, productive and fairer Scotland where opportunity prevails for all"".

Sir Tom made the comments as The Hunter Foundation published a new report by Professor David Bell of Stirling University looking at changes to devolution in the wake of the September 18 ballot.

The Smith Commission, which was set up after the referendum, recommended Holyrood get new tax and welfare powers, with legislation currently going through Westminster.

But Prof Bell's report warned that ""o verall the transfer of the new powers will be at best a zero sum game"". 

He said there was ""every likelihood"" the Scottish Government would ""have more control over Scottish affairs but less money than under previous fiscal settlements to invest"" unless it uses its new tax-raising powers. 

The Scottish Government will be able to raise £17.7 billion of its annual budget of about £30 billion, the report said. 

While new powers over income tax in the Scotland Bill have the ""greatest potential"" for increasing revenues, the report argued hikes in this are ""highly unpopular in the UK"", pointing out that recent chancellors have used ""stealth taxes"" to boost their spending power. 

""Because Smith's proposals cover a narrow range of highly visible taxes, the Scottish Government will not have access to the more subtle ways that recent chancellors of the exchequer have used to raise cash,"" the report said. 

""Though there maybe no reason in principle why Scotland should not increase income tax rates, Scottish governments may not wish to put their popularity at risk by doing so."" 

Additional welfare powers will add about £2.7 billion a year to the amount the Scottish Government needs to spend, the report stated. 

But it added the Scotland Bill differs from the Smith Commission recommendations in ""two important ways"", saying: "" The power to create new benefits only applies to those areas where responsibility is to be devolved. This implies the Scottish Government could create a new benefit for carers but not for the unemployed. 

""The transfer of individuals from disability living allowance to personal independence payments is to continue even though these benefits are to be devolved. This is highly unpopular because the tests for PIP eligibility are widely though to be unfair.""

Sir Tom said the report had been published because ""a year on we felt it important to review what was promised, what was delivered - or is in the process of being - what was missing and where we would be had we voted Yes"". 

With no agreement in place over the amount Scotland receives in its block grant from Westminster, Sir Tom added: ""W e sit in a bit of a beggars muddle where the Scottish Government is negotiating with HM Treasury over settlements; a negotiation that will undoubtedly fuel consistent sniping that Scotland is not getting enough of its share. 

""For me, personally, it's time to move on, move forward and use the powers we have. The population decided, politicians are democratically elected and should and must respect the decision of the voters.

""We are all ambitious for Scotland and its time for us to come together, put our differences aside and focus upon building a more prosperous, productive and fairer Scotland where opportunity prevails for all.""

Labour's shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray said: "" Sir Tom Hunter again has said that Scotland needs to move on from the arguments of the past and face the future. He is absolutely right to do so. 

""Scottish Labour wants to cut the gap between the rich and the rest in education to ensure that every child in every classroom gets the best possible start in life.

""We want to equip our young people with the skills for the jobs of tomorrow and protect our NHS for the challenges it will face in the next few decades. It's time to face the future, not argue about the past.

""The SNP and the Tories want to continue to bicker about the constitution because they can't defend their record in government, whether it is cutting tax credits for the working poor or an education system which sees a majority of those from poor backgrounds without the skills they need in reading, writing or numeracy. It's time to move on.""

A spokesman for the SNP said: "" Tom Hunter is right to point out that the Scotland Bill falls well short of even the limited powers of the Smith Commission - leaving too many key powers in the hands of the UK Government which should be transferred to Scotland. 

""Full economic powers need to be in Scotland's hands to allow Scotland's parliament to take action to grow the economy, support business and create jobs - rather than having growth held back by the austerity policies of David Cameron and George Osborne.

""With only 9% of people in Scotland believing the vow has been delivered and with an out-of-touch Tory government we didn't elect engaged in a relentless assault on the most vulnerable people in Scotland, it's no wonder support for independence is continuing to grow - as more and more people question whether Westminster is capable of representing Scotland's interests at all.""",d3f87d44-d58a-4ac1-b260-56f50af00b6c,News,2015-09-16T23:30:45Z,TalkTalk,Time to move on from independence...,0.0,News

19,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 16, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Each year, PhRMA and other biopharmaceutical industry leaders honor those who have made a significant contribution to the health care field. The Research and Hope Awards recognize the men and women conducting groundbreaking research, giving back to their community, advocating for patients and bringing awareness to particular diseases. This year, the awards honored those who are changing the world of oncology research and care. As we continue to gain new insight into the many variations of cancer, new tools are created, medicines are developed and new treatments emerge. With the help of dedicated individuals like the 2015 Research and Hope honorees, we move a little bit closer to transforming once-devastating diseases into manageable conditions.

https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150915/266923

This year's recipient of the Excellence in Biopharmaceutical Research award was the KEYTRUDA Team from Merck & Co., Inc. This team developed an approved treatment for advanced melanoma and it has the potential to treat many other types of cancer. We look forward to seeing the continued development of their breakthrough work.

J. Silvio Gutkind, Ph.D., professor, Department of Pharmacology; associate director, Basic Science, Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, is this year's recipient of the award for Excellence in Academic or Governmental Research. His extensive work with G proteins ultimately led to novel strategies for treating and preventing many types of cancer. These advances have the potential to save the lives of many patients in years to come.

The Community Champion Award went to Rick Dunetz, executive director and founder of the Side-Out Foundation. Rick, a local volleyball coach, invited his mother to work with his team after her breast cancer diagnosis. She found hope in their victories and the team was inspired to win not only for themselves, but for her as well. After seeing the transformation of his mother and his team, Rick founded the Side-Out Foundation to reach other athletes and cancer patients. His work is bringing hope and energy to the cause of ending breast cancer.

Vicki Kennedy, co-founder and president of the Board of the ; senior counsel, Greenberg Traurig LLP, was this year's recipient of the Award for Excellence in Advocacy and Activism. Since the passing of her late husband, Senator Ted Kennedy, Mrs. Kennedy has spoken publicly on coping with stress and enhancing quality of life for brain tumor patients and their loved ones. Her dedication to telling her story, and the story of thousands of other families whose lives have been impacted by cancer is inspiring to many.

The recipients of the Visibility and Progress Award are Liz and Jay Scott, co-founders of Alex's Lemonade Stand. In 2000, their four-year-old daughter, Alex, founded Alex's Lemonade Stand to raise money to find a cure for childhood cancer after her own diagnosis. Following Alex's death in 2004, her parents set up the foundation to continue her dream of finding a cure. Since Alex's first stand in 2000, the foundation has raised more than $100 million to fund more than 475 cutting-edge research projects. Alex's spirit of determination and hope lives on through the foundations work.

These five awardees are just a few of the individuals doing outstanding work in the field of oncology research. With their dedication and our continued commitment to finding a cure, the future for cancer patients and their families looks a little bit brighter. To read more about this exciting progress, take a look at some of the honoree's response to the latest Conversations question: What are you most excited about in the fight against cancer?

On behalf of PhRMA and the co-sponsors of the 2015 Research and Hope Awards, we thank you for your contributions to this important effort.

Varian's new Developer Cloud houses digital tools like information about TrueBeam® Developer Mode, and cloud-based applications for managing Developer Mode and simulating treatments. It is part of the company's overall objective to empower research-oriented clinical teams to accelerate the development of new treatment techniques and processes designed to improve outcomes for cancer patients. 

""When Varian introduced the TrueBeam platform in 2010, we included Developer Mode, an optional non-clinical development tool for researchers to use in pioneering and prototyping new treatment techniques,"" said Corey Zankowski 

In a separate development, the OncoPeer online forum, first launched last March in select geographic areas, is now accessible to Varian customers worldwide. Since March, users have established discussion groups on topics like oncology analytics, knowledge-based treatment planning, treatment planning using Eclipse™ software, and the physics of radiotherapy. One discussion group focuses on how to use Varian's ARIA® information system to manage a medical oncology department. Other groups share information about Varian treatment delivery platforms. 

""OncoPeer is a place for customers to find others who use Varian technology and learn from one another,"" said Sukhveer Singh 

Varian held an online seminar about Navigating OncoPeer last May. Interested clinicians can view a replay of the webcast at this registration website. Customers can access OncoPeer at www.oncopeer.com (registration required).

2664,"TOKYO, Sept 25 Japan's government is considering
new steps to tighten regulations on coal-fired power stations,
but some experts said these would not be enough to help meet its
goals on curbing carbon emissions over the next couple of
decades. 

Tokyo is trying to manage the competing demands of cutting
greenhouse gas emissions while burning coal at record levels
after the Fukushima disaster decimated public trust in nuclear
power. 

Climate change is centre stage internationally ahead of U.N.
environmental talks in Paris later this year, with Japan's
government coming under fierce criticism from environmentalists
over its support for coal. 

The nation's industry ministry is discussing rules forcing
all new stations to have a thermal efficiency equivalent to at
least around 40-42 percent of levels seen in so-called
ultra-super-critical plants, which typically get the most energy
from coal through the most advanced technology available for
commercial use. That would hit the construction of small plants
with a capacity below 112,500 kilowatts, whose maximum
efficiency usually stands around 36 percent. 

At the same time, the environment ministry is considering
making all plants go through a costly assessment that takes
around four years before being built. Currently only larger
plants are subject to the process, with smaller facilities often
only requiring local government approval. 
 
""These measures may help reduce the number of small plants,
but they won't be enough for Japan to keep its emission goal,""
said Takeo Kikkawa, professor at Tokyo University of Science. 

The world's No.5 emitter of CO2 has watered down emissions
targets, but still has a goal to cut greenhouse emissions by 26
percent from 2013 levels by 2030. 
 
That is despite plans to construct 40 more coal stations in
the next decade, including over 10 small plants that are cheaper
to build, as the country opens up its retail electricity market
from next April, exposing 10 regional power monopolies to new
competition. 

Any new steps would come on top of a voluntary plan
announced in July by electricity providers to cut greenhouse
emissions by more than a third by 2030 compared with 2013. But
the environment minister has questioned the plan, demanding
more-detailed measures. 

Hiroshi Takahashi, professor at Tsuru University, said
broader steps were required to meet Japan's goals. 
 
""Japan will need to bring in some compulsory measures such
as a (higher) environment tax or emissions trading."" 

An industry ministry official said the sector's voluntary
plan would be ""effective"" in achieving emissions goals, while an
official from the environment ministry said it was considering
all possible measures to help Japan reach its targets. 

Meanwhile, industry ministry officials denied a report by
the Nikkei business daily this week saying that it was
considering limiting each utility to using coal-fired plants for
a maximum of half their thermal power generation.

4060,"On Sunday, Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Jain ordered the purchase
 of 1,000 new beds to accommodate the surging number of dengue patients 
in hospitals. 


 Laxmichandra and Babita Rout had committed suicide after their 7-year-old son Avinash died due to suspected dengue.   
A seven-year-old boy's death followed by his parents' suicide has forced the government to wake up to the threat of dengue in Delhi. 

On Sunday, Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Jain ordered the purchase of 1,000 new beds to accommodate the surging number of dengue patients in hospitals. He also suggested that hospitals may postpone surgeries if possible to free beds for dengue patients, besides promising strict action against MCD staff members who were not executing fumigation work properly. 

The directions come in the wake of public outrage over a seven-year-old's death due to suspected dengue followed by his parents ending their lives by jumping off a building. Laxmichandra and Babita Rout, who hail from Odisha, had taken their only child Avinash to five private hospitals on September 7 but he was allegedly refused admission by the hospitals. After cremating him, the couple jumped off a four-storey building in Lado Sarai area of the Capital on Wednesday morning. 

The Capital is witnessing the worst dengue outbreak this year with 1,259 dengue cases being recorded so far. The number was reportedly higher only in 2010 when 1,512 cases were recorded in Delhi. 

Health Minister Jain on Sunday held a meeting of the health secretary, divisional commissioner and directors of local bodies. ""In view of the rise in dengue cases, I have ordered to buy 1,000 new beds within the next three or four days. If hospitals lack space, the new beds can be kept in lobbies or wherever space is available,"" Jain said after the meeting. 

The minister also suggested that hospitals may postpone surgeries if possible to make beds available for dengue patients. ""Hospitals have been asked to postpone surgeries by one month... our first priority is to treat such (dengue) patients,"" he said. Jain issued directions to all DMs, SDMs and tehsildars to closely monitor dengue cases in their wards. 

Jain accused the three municipal corporations of shirking away from their duty to control the mosquito menace. ""We have got several complaints from people that the MCD staff do not visit their homes (for fumigation), which is unacceptable. 

The government will take strict action against those who do not work properly,"" Jain said. The minister also acknowledged the infrastructure-related problems faced by the government while tackling the problem. 

""We do not deny that there are two patients on one bed but hospitals are working hard. We are working more on prevention... not much has been done regarding this. People should get admitted to hospital only after consulting a doctor and not out of panic,"" he said. 

Meanwhile, the Congress on Sunday attacked the Centre and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal over the issue. 

Party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said, ""Hospitals are directly under your (Delhi CM) supervision. In the Capital, a healthy child dies one day due to a disease and parents have to commit suicide. You are spending Rs 700 crore on advertisements. You could have given at least Rs 70 crore of this to Delhi hospitals to save lives.""",1ed73c81-20aa-473a-a6c9-a7c5ebddefb2,News,2015-09-14T03:17:06Z,India Today,Delhi: Suicide shock jolts AAP government into action,0.0,Blog

SAN JOSE, Calif. Former San Francisco 49ers defensive lineman Ray McDonald pleaded not guilty on Friday to a charge of rape by intoxication of a woman who reported being sexually assaulted at his home last December. 

McDonald, 31, has remained free on $100,000 bond since shortly after his arrest last month in the case, marking the latest criminal charges brought against a National Football League player. 

Defense lawyers entered the not guilty plea on his behalf in Santa Clara County Superior Court. The eight-year NFL veteran, dressed in a pinstripe suit, was silent, except to answer, ""Yes, your honor"" to procedural questions put to him by the judge. 

McDonald, who has previously asserted that he and his accuser had a consensual sexual encounter, did not address reporters outside the courthouse. He walked without comment to a waiting sport utility vehicle and was driven away. 

If convicted, he faces up to eight years in prison. 

Current 49ers linebacker Ahmad Brooks has been charged separately with misdemeanor sexual battery of McDonald's alleged victim on the same night. His charge carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail. 

Judge Shelyna Brown granted a request by McDonald's lawyers to seal grand jury transcripts in the case, which Deputy District Attorney Chris Lameiro did not oppose. 

Prosecutors have divulged few details about the circumstances of the alleged assault. 

In a civil lawsuit brought by McDonald's accuser, the woman said she repeatedly slipped on the pool deck of his home and fell, losing consciousness from a head injury…",4afcf991-7378-4277-a651-c6b4297cc910,News,2015-09-26T02:34:50Z,MyInforms,Former NFL player McDonald pleads not guilty to rape,0.0,Blog

447,"Even with a falling dollar, you don't have to give up on all of travel's 'luxuries'.  Photo: iStock  Luxury in travel is a matter of how you look at it, writes Lee Tulloch.  
Australian travellers have become rather fond of the comforts that a strong dollar has bought but the recent currency free fall has had quite a few of us doing our sums and trying to work out how we can continue to travel in the manner to which we have become accustomed. 

I'm off to the Republic of Ireland, a Eurozone country, but counting my blessings I'm not going to Northern Ireland, a pound country. The daily exchange rate has suddenly become my obsession. With every euro cent we plunge, I'm thinking: goodbye good times. 
 
If it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience, or even just the best experience available, go for it, and spend modestly on something else. 
  
But of course that is ridiculous. It's possible to have ""champagne wishes and caviar dreams"" (to quote a popular 1980s TV show) when the dollar buys less than 48 pence or US65¢. 

The first thing that needs to be rebooted is the concept of luxury. 

I'm always suspicious of the word 'luxury'. Often it's just a description of a bland, mediocre service that has a few frills more than basic. True luxury might be about many other things, according to personal taste - privacy, tranquillity or enriching experiences, perhaps. The dollar value on it is becoming increasingly irrelevant. 

The word is becoming irrelevant and meaningless too. 

One man's luxury might be gold taps and a plethora of cushions and obsequious service. Another's might be downtime in a beautiful, remote location where you can go off the grid. Still another might be a resort or cruise where you can leave the children in the hands of others. Or sleeping in a villa with an amazing history. 

The most ""luxurious"" hotel suite I've ever seen didn't have a whisper of gold or any hint of dazzle – it was exquisitely simple, created by one of the world's most notable designers. Luxury can be what is not as much as what there is. Simplicity can be as costly as ornamentation. 

Degrees of opulence never determined luxury for me. Often I'm more impressed with the small details, like pure cotton pyjamas provided at a Vietnamese resort, or a bath filled with rose petals in Bali. 

The greatest luxury for me in travel, what gives me my biggest kicks, is not wallowing in a bed with millions of pillows or sitting up the front of a plane, it is making friends with strangers, spending time with the great characters that populate our world, the thrill of discovering differences but also fellow feeling in the way we all look at the world. 

Leisure travel is luxury. We are fortunate to be able to do it. 

Travelling thriftily for me is not about cutting corners but about enhancing the experience and not giving in to false economies. I've learnt over the years by the mistakes of made, such as denying myself the restaurant where I'd really like to dine in favour of a cheaper one, and finding that, in the run of things, that extra $100 hasn't mattered one bit. 

If you wish it, small luxuries are perfectly possible at any time. Siphon off a day or two for a splurge on a pricey hotel or set aside funds for a lavish night out. Divert to a less expensive city, like Budapest, which is as opulent as Paris or London. You can have a little bit of luxury every day if you play your cards right. 

Someone once gave me some very good advice – travel with an evening gown or something dressy, because you never know who you might meet and where you'll be invited. So I always travel as if that invitation to someone's palace or villa is just around the corner. And if it isn't, I make my own glamour. 

Cocktails may cost upwards of 25 euro ($40) in the bars of some of Europe's luxury hotels, but you can nurse one for hours. The bar somewhere classy like Le Meurice in Paris is fascinating, full of diplomats, celebs and eccentrics. Even if you're staying somewhere that's nowhere near as salubrious, no one need know. You'll remember the night you lived it up at a swank hotel. 

Similarly, if you're dressed for it, the sales assistants of the world's expensive boutiques will let you play with their clothes and shoes for hours and you don't have to buy a thing. 

If it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience, or even just the best experience available, go for it, and spend modestly on something else. The nickels and dimes don't matter. It's the memories that count.",e0052ef2-a10c-4589-8ef6-ba3f856199ba,News,2015-09-18T14:28:51Z,WA Today,Luxury holidays with a low Australian dollar: Why you don't have to give up on luxury,0.0,News

Three Finnish confederations of workers, SAK, STTK and AKAVA, have decided to organize a mass demonstration on 18 September to protest against measures proposed by the Finnish government. 
  
If the government proposals are approved, Finnish workers could be deprived of a number of rights, including rights laid down in collective agreements. 
 
The Finnish government is using the pretext of boosting competitiveness in order to: 
 
Eliminate pay for two bank holidays; 
Make the first day of a worker’s sick leave unpaid and reduce the benefits for days two to nine; 
Reduce compensation for overtime; 
Reduce the level of extra pay given to workers for working on Sundays; 
Cut holidays in the public sector.

210,"19, September 2015: The whole sector of scooter has gone through triple phase. FOSJOAS intelligent self-balancing scooter transformed from the single-wheeled scooter to the twin-wheeled scooter, and then from the twin-wheeled scooter to the two-wheeled scooter. The triple transformation also marked the change in purpose of use. The single-wheeled scooter mainly serves the end of entertainment. The twin-wheeled scooter primarily fulfils the end of increasing the customer base. And the last model aims to meet the demand from production and locomotion. However, there is no model that serves the end of carrying goods. What if FOSJOAS electric intelligent scooter can carry goods? 
 

 
Many young people like FOSJOAS electric self-balancing scooter . Some who are energetic and enthusiastic ride FOSJOAS scooter tend to ride FOSJOAS electric self-balancing scooters to show off their thrilling riding skill in the street and in the parks. They represent the youth and vibration. And the two-wheeled scooter is used mainly in works and occasions like golf paddocks. The workers in the plant ride FOSJOAS scooters as transports. The speed of FOSJOAS scooters is enough in works. There is no need to worry about the crash accident. 
 

 
Except the recreational and functional purpose, many city dwellers appeal for the purpose of life. They usually go shopping or go to the supermarket for weekly purchase. They need purchase much goods. But the current FOSJOAS scooter cannot carry much goods. Especially when they go to the supermarket, they will buy many commodities for weekly use. A pile of goods is a laborious job to them. They cannot carry them home. A personal vehicle that is able to carry much goods is much needed. Therefore, this function of carrying goods is a very promising. In the near future, this function must be added to FOSJOAS scooter. 
 
More modifications and changes in FOSJOAS scooters are worth waiting.

3929,"Holidaymakers jetting off to take advantage of the strong pound and escape last month's rain helped easyJet notch up a record August, and is set to see the airline deliver better-than-expected profits. 
 
The no-frills carrier said it flew  7.1 million passengers last month after a surge of late bookings as Britons headed for beach and city destinations across Europe, boosted by the strength of the pound against the euro. 
 
EasyJet upped its annual profit outlook to between £675 million and £700 million for the year to September 30 after the bumper August performance, which is set to see the group post its fifth year in a row of record annual pre-tax profits. 
 
The group was previously expected to report profits of between £620 million and £660 million. 
 
Paul Moore, spokesman for easyJet, said: ""People have realised that the strong pound against the euro is really making their money go further on holiday."" 
 
The most popular destinations for sun-seekers were Malaga, Alicante, Faro and Palma, while Barcelona was also a top pick for those looking for a city and beach experience, according to easyJet. 
 
The pound has surged against the euro over the past year due to economic woes across Europe and expectations of an interest rate hike in the UK. 
 
In currency markets, sterling is worth 1.36 euros at today's prices, having reached as high as 1.44 euros in the past year. 
 
August's passenger numbers marked a 6.8% rise on the year earlier and the second consecutive month the group has carried more than 7 million fliers. 
 
The carrier also said its load factor - a measure of how well it fills its planes - hit a record last month at 94.4%. 
 
Mr Moore said bookings were made later this year after the beach terrorist attack in Tunisia in June and the uncertainty surrounding Greece affected travel earlier in the summer. 
   Promoted stories   
Last month's rain and colder than average temperatures for the time of year added to the exodus abroad, he added.

Luton-based easyJet said surging revenue growth in the key month of August - and a robust performance expected for this month - would more than offset higher costs faced by the business this year, including  disruption across the network particularly in April, the impact of the two fires at Rome Fiumicino airport and its £8 million settlement with Eurocontrol. 
 
Carolyn McCall, easyJet chief executive, said:  ""E asyJet was best placed to maximise the strong late summer demand from UK passengers to get away to beach and city destinations across Europe and will enable the airline to set new records for full-year revenue and profit.""",d9d58c89-1407-438a-846e-4e9c24c5d8ae,News,2015-09-03T09:33:39Z,St Albans and Harpenden Review,EasyJet hails record August as 7.1m passengers fly with airline,0.0,News

2462,"By Reid McCarter 
 
September 1 st will see the release of the final Metal Gear game directed by Kojima Productions’ Hideo Kojima. Barring an incredible surprise, the creator of the long-running stealth/action series will be moving on to new projects, completely divorced from the universe he’s lead development on for close to 30 years. 
 
This isn’t the first time Kojima has announced plans to abandon Metal Gear . As far back as the launch of 2001’s Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty , the designer has told press he wants to leave the series behind. Four sequels later, it finally seems Kojima is truly moving on. Unfortunately, his departure doesn’t seem to be on great terms, publisher Konami having stripped Kojima’s name from Metal Gear Solid V:  The Phantom Pain ’s cover art (and, even more bizarrely, forthcoming reprints of some of the previous games). While Konami has released confusing information claiming Kojima will still be involved in future Metal Gear titles, rumours suggest he’s already split from the publisher. 
 
Combined with Konami’s apparent pivot toward non-console videogame development following corporate restructuring earlier this year, the future of Metal Gear seems pretty dire. Even if the publisher does appoint a new development team to create another entry following The Phantom Pain ’s release, the question remains: would Metal Gear even work without its creator? 
 
There are very few videogame series that are tied so directly to their creative leads, but Metal Gear has always been one of them. From the first Metal Gear I played— Solid , back on the PlayStation One—it was impossible to separate the experience playing out onscreen with the developer responsible for its creation. This is made explicit at several points. A fourth wall-breaking fight against psychic villain Psycho Mantis pauses the action to display a fake TV input screen with HIDEO in place of the usual VIDEO in Metal Gear Solid.  Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes goes so far as to allow the player to rescue a digitally recreated Kojima from an interrogation camp. But, more than these outright winks, the tone of the series is the direct result of its writer/director’s development sensibilities. 
 
Metal Gear has garnered both admiration and criticism for its trademark design choices. There’s the long-winded character dialogue that finds ways to cover everything from world history and cultural theory to cinema and junior high-level jokes. There’s the exhaustive attention to detail that sees Solid Snake popping cold medicine to treat a cold or sneak through a swamp by wearing a costume alligator’s head. And, crucially, there’s the tightrope walk between serious war drama and slapstick cartoon that every game manages to navigate without veering too far in either direction. 
 
Trying to imitate all of this without Kojima’s input seems like a tricky feat. It also makes it hard to imagine that a Metal Gear developed without its original creator’s involvement would feel like a real continuation of the series. This obviously overlooks the fact that Hideo Kojima is not the sole creative force behind the series. Kojima Productions is made up of more than a single person—some of whom have been around since the earliest titles. But, given that the same rumours regarding Kojima’s split from Konami state that many other senior members of the team are also set to depart, there aren’t likely to be many left from the core Metal Gear team to assume creative leadership. 
 
The dramatic, public manner by which Kojima Productions seems to have dissolved—and, more importantly, information regarding the poor working conditions development teams at Konami’s Japanese offices face—mean that many may not be interested in purchasing another Metal Gear regardless of its direction. Still, the larger question is whether or not a game made with new creative talent would even feel like a natural extension of the previous titles. 
 
Too often, videogames are thought of as products and not the result of real people creating work that results from their own unique personalities and artistic sensibilities. Though publishers may own the rights to series like Metal Gear , there’s no way to own the process that goes into their development. Without Hideo Kojima and the team at Kojima Productions, Konami won’t be able to replicate what’s made the games they own so popular in the first place. A new studio may be able to create something new—possibly something just as good as what came before—but without the involvement of an original work’s creators, it can’t ever be the same.

2541,"Obama dropped in on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" on Monday night, taking a break from the action at the United Nations to promote her ""Let Girls Learn"" campaign and joke with the host about state dinners and the next first family who could occupy the White House. 

Colbert highlighted a letter to Obama by former first lady Laura Bush upon leaving the White House, asking, ""Without naming names, if we have a female president next, would you leave a letter for her husband? What would you say? What's the thing he needs to know more than anything else about the job?"" 

Obama replied, ""I would say, follow your passion, just be you."" 

Without missing a beat, Colbert made an apparent jab at Bill Clinton, saying ""I think he does,"" prompting a big laugh from the audience. 

While Obama protested, ""That wasn't me! I didn't say it,"" Colbert added, ""I have never met Carly Fiorina's husband, but I imagine he's a lovely man."" 

With the White House recently wrapping up a visit from Chinese President Xi Jinping, Colbert took the opportunity to prod Obama about not getting an invitation to the high-profile state dinner held last Friday. Colbert, who attended a previous state dinner for French President Francois Hollande, quipped, ""Haven't heard from you much since then. You just had one with the Chinese president, didn't get the call."" 

Colbert also turned the conversation to Obama's international campaign for education equality, which the White House touts as ""a government-wide effort that will leverage the investments we have made and success we have achieved in global primary school and expand them to help adolescent girls complete their education."" 

Colbert highlighted his own advocacy on the issue at the Global Citizens Festival in New York, cracking, ""My issue for that weekend was girls' education around the world, and I'm not saying you're kind of jumping on my thing, but you are here to talk about 'Let Girls learn.'

1293,"It's oh-so-ugly for Masters. There are gathering calls from investors and also from analysts to ditch the struggling hardware chain.

So where has it all gone so wrong?

Masters' big box store format commands about 13,500sqm of retail real estate, which is a lot of space and a lot of stock, when the customers aren't coming through the door. 

And the only remedies are costly and complicated like sub-leasing space and sharing the floor with another retailer.

Masters pricing strategy has never hit the mark for shoppers.

Its big blue corporate brand didn't immediately speak value to customers.

Without the clout of some of the highest profile hardware brands, it doesn't have the firepower to go head to head on Bunnings on big name promotions. 

Hardware is driven by the big, powerhouse brands. They give comfort to novice DIY-ers and, at the other end of the spectrum, the tradie who wants to have all their favourites.

Masters seems to have underestimated the pulling power of names like Dulux and Makita.

You won't find these at Masters and it's hampered their attempts to price match Bunnings when they can't put up the same product at the same price.

Masters settled for second rate locations in the hope that if they built it the shoppers would come.

The problem with these growth-belt suburbs is the consumers don't have the spending power that's within arm's reach of so much of the Bunnings network.

Masters misjudged the demographics and its sales have suffered as a consequence.

Masters sales need to double for the operation to break even, according to some analysts, and there's skepticism over the hardware chain's claim its new formats are driving big sales improvements.

In a year when Bunnings reported a $1.1 billion profit, Masters total sales didn't even reach that, hitting just $930 million

1557,"The pressure to do it all, have it all, be it all, and still have a perfect home to throw Pinterest parties in is pervasive and leads inexorably to talk of multitasking and time management. Balance , to me, is finding a way to spin all the plates on all our appendages. But if minimalism is a counterpoise to physical excess, then taking things out of our schedules must be the antidote to busyness and the key to being present . Here are some ways to practice presence in your daily life. 
 
 1. Put the technology away. Lose the phone, close the laptop, turn off the tablet. Whatever it is, if it has a screen, stop looking at it and look at a person, look at the sky, look at yourself in the mirror. Disconnect to connect. I'm saying this to myself, as well. 
 
 2. Take a hard look at what you do with your time. We all have things we have to do (work, cook, clean, pay bills) and things we want to do (spend time with our families, finish the baby albums, go for a girls'/guys' night out). We also have things that must be done and things that, frankly, don't have to be done. If anything falls into both categories of I don't want to do it and doesn't have to be done (at least not by me) , by all means get it off your schedule and out of your life! Time is too precious. 
 
 3. Compartmentalize your time. Do whatever you can to associate certain places with certain activities; namely, leave your work at work and when you're at home, be at home. Of course, this isn't always so clear-cut. If you work from home or you must check email, etc., outside of office hours, designate specific- preferably small- chunks of time for those activities. If you're doing work, do it well, do it wholly, so you're free in mind and heart to truly be with your loved ones when it's time for that. Exercise to be where you are . If you're home, enjoy it, live in it, interact with it and with others in it. If you're with people... you get the idea. We all know this, we all want it, but we've got to start actually doing it. 
 
 4. Make the ordinary special. Use those in-between times- those car rides to the kids' activities, the grocery shopping, the dinner-cooking, even the cleaning, all those daily ""boring"" things- as opportunities to have conversations and enjoy one another's company or even enjoy the task itself. Those activities are a means to a practical end, but we can do more to make the means count and to enjoy them, all through an awareness of our mindset. 
 ""I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately ... not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived ... I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life."" -Henry David Thoreau, Walden: Or, Life in the Woods   ""Remember, remember, this is now, and now, and now. Live it, feel it, cling to it. I want to become acutely aware of all I’ve taken for granted."" 
-Sylvia Plath  
Busyness isn't a badge of honor, and multitasking robs us all too often of what matters most. As usual, literature connects us to a sobering deeper truth. Henry David Thoreau and (tragically, poignantly) Sylvia Plath remind us that a full life isn't one that's busy or balanced, but one that's lived .

3105,"School can be difficult. But are you encouraging or hindering your child's success? Here are 10 habits you may not realize are damaging to his or her success in school. 1. Forget about tomorrow morning. Let her stay up late! It’s not like she needs a full nights’ rest to do well in school; she can sleep in her desk! Besides, she hates bedtime and it’s so much easier to let her stay up with you and watch some of those funny late night television shows. 2. Don’t ask her about her homework every day or how school is going. You don’t want to be a nag. She’s probably got it all figured out and will get great grades without your getting involved. 3. Don’t worry about grades until a week or two before they come out. You have plenty of time! Your schedule is too busy anyway to be bogged down with your child’s education. If she misses class or a few assignments here and there, the teacher will gladly accept them until the last day of the term and if he doesn’t, you can just call the principal and she’ll sort it all out. 4. Yell at your child until she gets her homework done. Ground her and take away her cell phone. That’s how you really get someone motivated to work hard. If she complains, tell her you walked to school uphill both ways in the snow with no shoes; she’ll quickly realize that she’s being ungrateful and get right to work. 5. Don’t worry about attending Parent-Teacher Conference. That teacher couldn’t have anything helpful to say about how she is doing in his class. After all, what did he do with his life? He’s just a teacher. He better just shape up and do what you say, after all; you’re the parent and you pay taxes. 6. Whenever she has a doctor or dentist appointment, be sure to make that appointment during her hardest class. It will give her a much needed break and it’s not like you’re worried about her making up the work. That’s the teacher’s problem, not yours. 7. Don’t worry about whether your child has breakfast before she heads to school. School is early enough; it’s not worth getting up earlier to make breakfast. Besides, it’s not like learning is a bodily function; it’s more of a brain function. Page 2 of 2 - 8. Don’t praise your child if she does something well in school; it will just go to her head. Your job is to motivate her by pointing out only the things she does wrong. After all, if you don’t say it, who will? 9. If you have a complaint, always go straight to the top! Principals love to get involved in every little situation; that’s why they’re called princi-“pals.” 10. Don’t worry about setting a good example of continued learning. You already went to school! Been there, done that. You have too much work to do now to fit in reading a good book or showing your child that you still love art. Never talk about what inspired you to get where you are today; that will just bore her.",156f2830-94df-4b97-b28c-1faf273a979c,News,2015-09-19T03:18:47Z,Wicked Local Canton,10 ways you're helping your child fail in school and don't even realize it,0.0,Blog

6. 1 Tbsp butter 

7. 1 egg, beaten and poured into a shallow dish 

For the slaw 

1. 2 cups Brussels sprouts, grated 

2. 1 cup fresh blueberries 

3. 1/4 cup sliced almonds 

4. 1/2 cup Golden Girl Bluesberry Granola 

5. 2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar 

6. 1/4 tsp salt 

Instructions 

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 

Crush the granola 

1. Pour the granola into a zip-top bag, removing most of the air before sealing. 

2. Use a rolling pin to crush the granola until it has the consistency of breadcrumbs. Spread it onto a plate and set aside. 

Pound out the chicken 

1. Place the chicken on a cutting board and cover with a strip of plastic wrap 

2. Use a mallet to pound the chicken, starting from the center, working your way to the edge 

3. Pound out to about 1/4-inch thickness 

4. In a small bowl, combine the goat cheese and blueberries. Use a fork to crush the berries and mix them into the goat cheese until mostly smooth and well-combined. 

5. Sprinkle the chicken with the salt and pepper, then spread the goat cheese mixture on all but the top 1-1/2 inches of the chicken. 

6. Starting at the bottom, roll up the chicken into a log, ending with the edge that doesn't have any goat cheese on it. 

7. Melt the butter in an oven-safe sauté pan set over medium-high heat. 

8. Carefully lift the chicken and dip it first into the egg wash, letting any excess drip off, and then into the granola, pressing the granola onto all sides of the chicken. 

9. Place the chicken in the sauté pan and cook for 2 minutes. 

10. Use a wide spatula to carefully turn the chicken over, then put the pan in the oven. Bake for 7 minutes, or until a thermometer inserted in the center reads 165 degrees. 

11. Remove the pan from the oven and tent a piece of aluminum foil over the pan for 5 minutes to allow the chicken time to rest. 

12. Slice and serve. 

For the slaw 

1. Combine all of the slaw ingredients in a medium-sized bowl. 

2. Gently toss to combine

3960,"Arsenal coach  Arsene Wenger and his partner Annie are understood to have completed their separation. 

According to the Mirror , the pair have divided their assets, agreed on a financial package and intend on going their separate ways. 

The tabloid report that court papers have been filed in Strasbourg, the manager’s birthplace and the closest city to Duttlenheim, the village where the coach was raised. The documents apparently indicate that the 65-year-old manager and his partner, 59, have not been together since the beginning of the summer. 

While not a full divorce, the papers—a ‘separe du corps—represent a legal separation. 

The report adds that the couple have not been pictured together since 2013, and note that the coach has previously confessed that the pressure of running the London giants has placed strain on his relationship. 

Back in 2008, as quoted by the Mirror, Wenger revealed a promise he had made to his wife to one day quit football in order to dedicate more time to their relationship. 

“Ten years ago I said to my wife [Annie], ‘Five more years and that’s all’, and I am still here. 

“It is difficult to find time to see them but there are jobs [which are worse]. You have guys who leave for work on Monday and come back on Friday. 

“In my job I travel, but the problem is not so much the quantity of time you spend with your family, it is the quality.

“That is where this job is more damaging. You do not always give them the quality they deserve when you are at home because you are thinking of the next game. 

“My wife likes watching football, she watches all the games of Arsenal at home. She is not a fanatic but she likes watching sports. No, she does not have much choice.” 

The couple have an 18-year-old daughter together, and were married in December 2010. 

Wenger is not the first manager to acknowledge the fact that a full-time role as a manager is hard to combine alongside a committed and dedicated family life. 

When Sir Alex Ferguson left Manchester United and retired from football, he admitted that his duty of supporting his wife, particularly following the death of her sister, was not something he could easily do alongside his responsibilities at Old Trafford [ Express ].

2658,"WASHINGTON - The traffic getting into D.C. today was the same as the previous two days despite the arrival of Pope Francis. No reason to leave the house any earlier, but I'm already seated in the Nationals Park press box while the grounds crew waters the infield and Paul Janish chats with Reed Johnson in shallow center field. 
 
The Orioles will take early batting practice beneath a blue sky, with hardly a trace of clouds overhead. The nicest day so far since the Orioles arrived here. 
 
How's that for color? 
 
Update: Miguel Gonzalez is throwing his simulated game today under that same blue sky. So far so good. 
 
Manny Machado registered his 500th career hit last night, impressive when considering that he reached the milestone at 23 years, 78 days, making him the youngest player in Orioles history. 
 
Also consider that he's playing on two surgically repaired knees and he's the only major leaguer this season to appear in every game. 
 
According to STATS, Machado is the seventh-youngest active player with 500 hits. He set the Orioles record by unseating Hall of Famer Eddie Murray, who was 23 years, 197 days old. Cal Ripken, Jr. was third, according to STATS, at 23 years, 339 days. 
 
Ubaldo Jimenez reached his own milestone last night by becoming the 11th Dominican-born pitcher with 100 career victories, but he had other reasons to feel special. 
 
According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Jimenez became the second American League pitcher this season to be credited with a victory and a game-winning RBI in the same game, joining the Rays' Nathan Karns on July 21 versus the Phillies. 
 
Jimenez also became the 25th American League pitcher in 19 years of interleague play to record a victory and game-winning RBI. 
 
Jimenez has two RBIs this season. He also drove in a run on June 17 in Philadelphia. 
 
Since the designated hitter rule was enacted in 1973, only eight other AL pitchers have driven in a run in two different games in the same season, and the list includes four Orioles - Jimenez, Mike Mussina in 1999, Kris Benson in 2006 and Zach Britton in 2",d51c2ca1-7b3c-4012-8f5a-4b789b2243ee,News,2015-09-23T18:46:40Z,Mid Atlantic Sports Network,Taking another look at Machado and Jimenez milestones (updated) - School of Roch,0.0,News
2586,"HAMILTON, N.Y. , Sept. 2, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Robert Fox '59, of Reno, Nev. , has been a leader, mentor, and friend to many people at Colgate University , and beyond. So when he invested $10 million in financial aid at his alma mater in Hamilton, N.Y. , last July, others were quick to trust his wisdom and join the Fox Partnership. 

Keen to sustain the momentum of financial aid fundraising at Colgate , Fox offered his gift as inspiration. Ultimately, 26 partners each invested a minimum of $250,000 . They amassed a total of nearly $27 million in just 12 months, in some cases directing their support to financial aid for the first time. 
   
At a dinner held recently in his honor, Fox told guests, ""I've had a great life, and it happened because I went to Colgate . I was only able to be there because of financial aid."" 

Fox, now 78 and mostly retired, knows his gift will impact hundreds of lives while also raising awareness for the impact of financial aid. ""Financial aid can enable students to live their lives to their full potential,"" he said. 

Every one of the Fox partners expresses love and gratitude for Colgate . Of the 26 partners, 16 have sent one or more of their children to Colgate . Fourteen graduated in the 1980s, and there are three Colgate couples. 

At Colgate , where the average aid award in 2015–2016 was $46,602 , Fox Partnership proceeds will go a long way, especially when combined with the $142 million raised for financial aid during the university's recent Passion for the Climb campaign and the $45 million raised in the two years since. 

The partnership total includes $11.77 million in estate and life-income arrangements and $15.05 million in cash — it also provides ongoing incentive for others to support Colgate's financial aid program in years to come. 

""Financial aid ensures not only access and socioeconomic diversity, it also widens the pipeline for the best and brightest students,"" said Murray Decock '80, senior vice president for external relations, advancement, and initiatives. ""Access is a passport to opportunities, achievement, and career fulfillment. Thanks in large measure to Bob Fox and his partners, the word is out that Colgate is more accessible than ever, and counselors are now steering an ever-more diverse group of students to our campus.""

1115,"Lewis Hamilton was left baffled by his team's dramatic drop in performance in Singapore but he refused to give up hope of winning under the lights on Sunday. 
 
		 
Hamilton, bidding to match Ayrton Senna's record of 41 career wins from 161 starts, had claimed pole in 11 of the 12 previous races but qualified only fifth at the Marina Bay Circuit. 
  Things did not go to plan for Lewis Hamilton during Saturday's qualifying session   
The world champion was 1.5 seconds slower than Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, who claimed his inaugural pole in the red of Ferrari and the team's first in over three years.  Hamilton will be joined on the third row by his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg. 

			 
""I did everything I could today. I am ahead of Nico, I lost a little bit of time in the last couple of corners but it would not have made any difference in terms of my position,"" Hamilton said. 



 
""So I am going to approach it the same as I do every race. I want to win and there is no reason why you can't win from fifth. 

""The guys ahead have been quicker all weekend, so you have to assume that is going to be the same tomorrow, but I go with the mentality of trying to win."" 

Hamilton and his Mercedes team are pinning the blame for their lacklustre showing on their tyres. 

The Mercedes drivers, who both complained of a lack of grip on Saturday, were called to see the stewards after the last race in Italy following a tyre pressure breach. After a lengthy investigation Hamilton's win, his seventh of the campaign, stood. 

			 
""We have not lost any performance on our car, the drivers have not lost any performance, so there is only one way it can come from and it is obviously the tyres. But I don't know why that is the case,"" Hamilton, who failed to qualify on the front row for the first time in 19 races, said. 

""I am challenging my team to find out what it is - whether it is in tyre pressures, temperatures, blankets, ride heights - I am challenging them to find out so we can win tomorrow. 

""I don't remember another time in my Formula One career where something like this has happened, where we have not changed anything on the car but we are a second and a half down. 

""It is a new experience for us but I have no reason to believe it is going to continue for more races. It might just be track dependant."" 

			 
Rosberg, who trails Hamilton by 53 points ahead of Sunday's race, admitted he was blown away by Vettel's display. The four-times world champion was over half a second quicker than anyone else. 

""Everybody is massively surprised and we did not see it coming,"" said Rosberg of his team's performance. 

""We don't understand it for now and we tried a lot of things because we understood we had a bit of an emergency situation. 

""I looked at Sebastian's on-board camera and, I  didn't  really want to, but I shouted out loud in the engineering room 'what the hell?' It seems like he is on a different planet in some  corners .""

Amazon	Advertisement Related Galleries The Oddly Beautiful Artificial Light of the World's Cities What It's Like to Stare a Hurricane Wave in the Face You Can't Understand Design Without Experiencing These 14 Classic Works Amazon announced six new devices this morning—and not one of them is a phone. In fact, all seven are staunchly not the kind of do-everything device the company attempted with the Fire Phone. With four tablets and two set-top boxes, Amazon made a single statement: We win at entertainment. You want to draw, futz with spreadsheets, or map the human genome? Great. Buy an iPad (preferably on Amazon.com!). But if you’re a Prime member looking for a way to watch movies, read books, or listen to music, Amazon believes firmly there’s no better way than with Amazon. And honestly, it makes a pretty compelling case. Before we go further, here are the seven new devices: • A faster Fire TV box with 4K support: $99.99 • A new Fire TV Stick with Voice Search and Alex voice control: $39.99 • A 10.1-inch Kindle Fire HD tablet: $229 • Same thing, 8 inches: $149.99 • A 7-inch Fire tablet for the super-cheap: $49.99 • The kids’ version with a bumper and a two-year replacement guarantee: $99.99 Whew! There are a few highlights worth pointing out: The Fire TV’s 4K support (and Amazon’s impressive selection of 4K content) is a huge upgrade, not to mention a pointed victory over the new Apple TV. Alexa integration means you get almost all the capability of the voice-powered Amazon Echo box, right on your TV. The tablets have bigger screens than before, but are thinner and still pretty easy to hold. Everything—everything—is created with reading and watching in mind. The new tablets also come with a completely redesigned version of their operating system called Fire OS 5. Next to the carousel-filled, dark-on-dark interfaces Amazon’s built before, Fire OS 5 is a refreshing and desperately needed change. Now, you get a light background and a grid of content; your favorite stuff on one page, your recent stuff on another, all your movies on another yet. It feels usable, really for the first time. And there’s a reason: Amazon has finally figured out exactly what the Fire devices are about. Remember that old maxim “tablets are for consumption?” As other big companies like Apple and Microsoft have fought tooth and nail to prove they’re more than just movie-watching devices, Amazon’s leaning into the idea. These are devices for watching movies. And reading books, and watching TV shows, and listening to music. Thing is, Amazon is really, really good at those things. And there are lots of people who want them. Amazon’s proven it can make good hardware and sell it for less than most of its competitors. That’s true here too: the new Fire HD tablets are thin and light, and still impressively durable. During his demonstrations, Dave Limp, Amazon’s head of devices, pulled out an iPad Air and a Fire HD that had gone through equivalent tests. The iPad’s screen was shattered; the Fire’s plastic was scuffed but the device was otherwise perfect. They have decently loud speakers, lots of nice accessories, the whole nine yards. Even the $50 model looks pretty good! On the TV side, the Fire TV has been maybe the best set-top box on the market since the day it came out. (Or at least since whatever day it finally got HBO.) Now, with Alexa, the voice search should be even more useful. There’s a new controller for gaming, a bunch of upgraded hardware inside the box, and improvements to the ASAP feature that pre-caches video to make it play faster. And not only do the new set-top boxes offer 4K streaming, they use a better kind of video encoding (called HEVC) that uses less bandwidth to stream video. That means you’re more likely to get a high-def stream, even when you have a bad connection. Every good new feature of the new devices exists in service of one single thing: content. Books, music, movies, TV shows, games, all the things you do when you’re not doing the work everybody else wants you to do on their tablets. When Amazon does its job well, it makes finding and consuming stuff easier than anyone else. There are plenty of gaps in Amazon’s content ecosystem, sure. And let’s not forget that you’re still paying $99 a year for access, on top of the price of your device. (If you’re not already a Prime subscriber, any Fire device basically morphs into one unending Prime commercial.) But Amazon has integrated so many other sources—there are 3,000 channels, apps, and games for Fire TV, they say—that anything you can’t find from Amazon you can probably get from Netflix, Hulu, HBO Now, Sling, or, I don’t know, the Red Bull channel. It’s tough to beat the Fire ecosystem when it comes to the size of the content firehose. Now, the products are finally focused on this core competency and little else. Rather than blindly assume everyone lives entirely within Amazon’s ecosystem—which has proven a road to ruin—the company’s just hoping people want to watch some movies. After years of trying to find itself, Amazon finally seems to have a clear sense of what its own devices are for. It’s finally not competing with the iPad and Rokus of the world. These devices are mostly just another benefit to Prime customers, like two-day shipping or the super-cheap grocery shopping options. That clarity of purpose seems to have come with a certain clarity of execution, too. Amazon’s devices should be good enough to make that content easy to access, and as cheap as physically possible. (Someday, we’ll all get these devices free with our Prime subscriptions.) Amazon’s software should be insanely easy to use, and its recommendations should be so good you never run out of stuff to do. Once all that happens—and the new devices are a pretty big step in that direction—Amazon’s going to have a hell of a device lineup on its hands. Just as long as it doesn’t try making any more phones.

3761,": UN member states must use the next Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of Thailand to demand key human rights commitments from the government, FIDH, its member organization Union for Civil Liberty (UCL), and its partner organization Internet Law Reform Dialogue (iLaw) said today. 
 
FIDH, UCL, and iLaw made the call with the release of two joint submissions for Thailand’s second UPR, which is scheduled to be held in April 2016 in Geneva, Switzerland. 
 
 “UN member states must continue to demand that Thailand bring its repressive laws into compliance with its international obligations with regard to the rights to freedom of opinion, expression, and peaceful assembly,”  said FIDH President Karim Lahidji.  “States must also urge Thailand to take concrete steps towards the abolition of the death penalty,”  he added. 
 
One submission , prepared by FIDH and iLaw, details how the situation concerning the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the right to peaceful assembly has markedly worsened since Thailand’s first UPR in 2011. 
 
Thailand has continued to restrict those rights through the use of legislation and proclamations that are inconsistent with the country’s obligations under international law, notably the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). 
 
Following the 22 May 2014 coup, the situation has further deteriorated. Numerous orders and announcements issued by the ruling military junta, the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), imposed additional restrictions on the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the right to peaceful assembly. This has a resulted in a strict enforcement of a ban on public gatherings, events, and discussions that authorities claimed might affect national security. In addition, authorities have stepped up the intimidation of media workers, censorship, and the overzealous application of lèse-majesté laws. 
 
Of particular concern is the growing number of lèse-majesté arrests and prosecutions under Article 112 of the Thai Criminal Code. The deprivation of liberty and the imposition of disproportionately harsh prison sentences under the pretext of protecting the monarchy intensified significantly after the 22 May 2014 coup. On 22 May 2014, there were six people serving prison terms for offences under Article 112. As of 21 September 2015, that number had gone up to 35 and at least 14 more remained detained awaiting trial. 
 
 “Only through a return to genuine democracy can the reform of present laws relating to lèse-majesté, computer crimes, and public protest be achieved, so as to establish full rights to freedom of opinion, expression, and peaceful assembly. At this time, however, the most immediate demands on the NCPO should be to repeal Article 44 of the interim Constitution, rescind all orders restricting freedom of expression and assembly, end the use of military courts to try civilians, and cease all arbitrary detentions,”  said iLaw Executive Director Jon Ungpakorn. 
 
In a separate joint submission , FIDH and UCL document Thailand’s failure to make real progress towards the abolition of the death penalty. 
 
Since Thailand’s first UPR, there has been no effort to reduce the number of crimes subject to the death penalty. Instead of reducing the number of offenses that are defined as capital crimes, lawmakers introduced new legislation and proposed laws that expand the offenses that can be punished by death. 
 
Drug-related offenses continue to represent a disproportionate share of the crimes for which a death sentence is imposed. Thirty-seven percent of the men and 80% of the women who were under death sentences as of 31 May 2015 had been found guilty of drug-related offenses. 
 
Thailand has repeatedly declared its intention to consider abolishing capital punishment. However, many of the official statements have made the abolition of the death penalty contingent on the support of public opinion. Regrettably, successive governments have failed to provide the general public with relevant information to have an informed opinion on the issues related to the death penalty. 
 
 “Thailand has considered abolishing the death penalty and issued a plethora of statements to that effect. However, the lack of political will has stifled any meaningful action. Also missing is a government initiative to adequately inform and educate the general public on the issue,”  said UCL Senior Advisor Danthong Breen.  “Despite a steady decline in the number of prisoners under death sentence and no executions for more than six years, abolition remains an elusive goal,”  he added. 
 
The FIDH-UCL joint submission makes important recommendations to Thailand’s government to take steps towards the abolition of the death penalty.

2543,"Police believe a man is badly hurt after an assault in Girrawheen on Monday - but they do not know who, or where, he is.

Police officers were called to a disturbance in Amberton Avenue, near the corner of Morgan Way, about 3.30am and found evidence of a serious assault but nothing else, spokesman Sam Dinnison said. 

They do not know who the man was and St John Ambulance had not received any emergency calls. 

However, Channel Nine News reporter Jerrie Demasi told Radio 6PR that earlier, a carload of people in a black Jeep had apparently arrived at a house on Amberton Avenue.

""They took a man from the car... they allegedly bashed him and then we're hearing they allegedly ran over his legs with the car before bundling him back into that Jeep and taking off.""

Residents called police, but when they arrived, there was nothing left but a few items of clothing – a belt, a beanie and a pair of glasses.

""They don't know who this man is, [or] how badly he was hurt,""

A red Alfa Romeo has also gone missing and police believe the same group of men stole that car from a Landsdale home before the incident in Girrawheen. 

Police have cordoned off Amberton Avenue between Marangaroo Drive and Morgan Way while forensic officers examine the scene.

1047,"A young German man was rescued by emergency services from the isolated cove Cala Llebeig, known locally as the fishermen’s cove, located on the rugged coast of the Poble Nou de Benitatxell, Alicante. He had to be evacuated by sea after the helicopter rescue team were unable to help the 28 year old victim. 

The exhausted adventurer had made the journey along a coastal cliff top path that runs in between the Cala Moraig beach of Cumbre del Sol and the hidden cove of Cala Llebeig, a stretch of approximately two kilometers of rough terrain. A route used historically by fishermen, the trail descends down into the small cove which is where friends of the victim started to worry for the health of the man. Fearing he may suffer from respiratory failure, since he showed signs of extreme exhaustion and was unable to make the journey back, they called emergency services 112. The man is said to have been of large build and weighing over 150 kilos. 

The tiny cove is inaccessible by road so the only options were for air or sea rescue. Emergency services ruled out the possibility of helicopter rescue so the SVS Company from nearby Cala Moraig made the evacuation by sea. He was taken to Cala Moraig where he was then transported by ambulance to the hospital in Denia.",4cacabc5-16f8-46ad-a631-b8ab9e742db4,News,2015-09-14T16:41:31Z,EuroWeeklyNews,Tourist rescued from the fishermen’s cove,0.0,News
1507,"England sprang a minor surprise by recalling James Taylor for the first Royal London Series match against Australia at the Ageas Bowl. 
 
		 
Taylor has not played for England since leading his country for the first time in a rain-ruined one-day international against Ireland in Dublin at the start of this summer. 
  James Taylor returned for England against Australia   
He was listed to bat at number three here, behind an opening pair of Alex Hales and Jason Roy and in place of Joe Root - who has been rested from the squad for this five-match series. 

			 
England also brought back Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes, with Sam Billings and David Willey the absentees from the team which beat New Zealand at Chester-le-Street more than two months ago. 



 
Steve Smith, in his first match as Australia's official captain in this format, chose to bat first on a cloudy afternoon. 

Only five of the team which won the World Cup for Australia earlier this year remained here, the tourists sticking with the line-up which beat Ireland last week. 

England announced shortly after the toss that they have called Reece Topley into their squad. 

The left-arm seamer, who will play his cricket at this venue from next season after leaving Essex for Hampshire, impressed on his international debut in Monday's one-off Twenty20 victory over Australia in Cardiff.

3000,"Every minute 2,460,000 pieces of content are shared on Facebook. If this isn’t content shock , it’s something close to it. 
 
Fresh and engaging content won’t necessarily rise to the top – and paying to boost your ads runs the risk of making consumers turn off. 
 
Pierre-Loic Assayag, founder of Traackr, opens the event. 
 
At Traackr’s Beyond the Buzzword: Influencer Marketing in Action  event, a panel of experts discussed influencer marketing and how important it is for brands to engage in it. 
 
Authoritative content is the most trusted by users (51% trusted) – yet only 20% of marketing budgets are dedicated to creating it. 
 
An influencer can boost your signal to their engaged audience, and lend your brand authority, insulating you against content shock. 
 
Great insights from Pierre-Loic Assayag of Traackr – people trust people over brands. 
 5 steps to begin engaging with influencer relations  1. Find your brand’s influencers  

 
“A sign of true influencer is somone who doesn’t know their Klout score” says @AndrewGrill , to a room of laughter #traackruk — Traackr (@traackr) September 22, 2015 
 
Stanislas Magniant, Online Communications Director for Coca-Cola describes the Magic Middle. 
 
Reaching out to an influencer doesn’t have to mean securing Beyonce. Bloggers are the new celebrities, and because of the weight and depth of the authentic connection they’ve built with fans, they may be even more authoritative than the big names.   Your key influencers can be found in the “Magic Middle” – not YouTube superstars, but not Twitter eggheads either. Those people who will engage with you – and not tell you to call their agent.   Tools like Traackr make it easy to find and engage your influencers – and there’s also the good old fashioned spreadsheet.     
 2. Engage your Superfans  
Superfans will be easy to find – they’re the ones talking to you about how great you are.  
  
Super fans are not only those with huge communities, but those who are literally super fans of the brand #traackruk  pic.twitter.com/8ptxxAacXj 
 
— Luke Freeman (@lukie3man) September 22, 2015 
 
  
 
Don’t just bask in your superfans’ praise – engage them and turn them into genuine advocates for your business. This could mean wooing them with gifts, sneak peeks at new products, or asking them to create content for you. 
 3. Remember you’re writing a love story  
Building an influencer relationship takes time and investment. From that point of view alone, a one-off campaign doesn’t make sense. Instead, capitalise on your relationship by involving your influencer in content creation, and working with them on an on-going basis

— Mike Tinmouth (@michaeltinmouth) September 22, 2015 
 

 4. Never underestimate the value of meeting IRL  
A coffee is worth a thousand emails. Getting together with your influencers – in your office (so exciting for a super-fan!), or by organising an event for them to connect to other fans – can go a long way.  
 
The dirty secret of online communities is meeting in real life. IRL is king! #TraackrUK pic.twitter.com/mz1TyeJ4l1 — RayRay (@RachelRayner) September 22, 2015 
 
  
 5. Consider paying your influencers  
The Traackr panel: Johanna Whitaker, Andrew Grill and Garth Farrar discuss influencer relations. 
 
One of the most contentious points of the Traackr event was whether or not influencers should be paid.   Does paying your influencers undermine their authenticity? Does paying an influencer turn them into just another advertiser – but one you have less control over?  
 
. @farrargarth Don’t confuse the term “influencer” with “celebrity” where you’re basically paying for reach #traackruk — Alistair Wheate (@alistairtweet) September 22, 2015 
 
In an ideal world, influencers would be super-fans, genuinely engaged with the brand and overjoyed to work for free. However, like all relationships, the relationships you have with your influencers have to be reciprocal, a true partnership which benefits both parties. Whether that’s rewarding your influencers with money-can’t-buy experiences, producing high-quality content for them to share, or cold, hard cash, ensuring the relationship is reciprocal will help it last into the long term.

2504,"“Don’t take this class if you believe the Bible is inspired or infallible.” 
 
When I started taking classes a year ago as an entering doctoral student here at UC Berkeley, I knew I was entering a very liberal environment. I had heard that the campus was the flagship of liberal academia, and I was also familiar with other bastions of liberalism during my time in the Ivy League and at Oxbridge as an undergraduate and a master’s student, respectively. But despite UC Berkeley’s ultra-liberal reputation, I took it as a given that there was still significant latitude for free thought and expression in the classroom. 
 
Thus, I was not expecting the unapologetically heavy-handed double standard I encountered from the professor, a well-respected biblical scholar. His initial cutting remark within five minutes of the start of class was soon followed by more: “This stuff isn’t taught in synagogues or churches because they don’t want to piss people off. … Anyone can take this class, as long as you play by the rules of the game. … If you disagree with the approach we use, that’s an F.” 
 
I was shocked — not only by his contempt for religion but also by the fact that he wasn’t even trying to be subtle about his narrow-minded academic approach. Apparently, free thought and academic curiosity were off limits from the get-go. “I don’t want people who are going to disagree with me all semester,” the professor declared in no uncertain terms. 
 
To be fair, part of me understood where my professor was likely coming from. After all, as Thomas Kuhn writes in his classic book “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,” prevailing paradigms within any disciplinary study (including the study of the Bible) demand adherence to certain assumptions or ground rules that allow the field to advance within that paradigm. Thus I understood that my professor probably wanted to operate within a historical-critical framework of studying the Old Testament without having to deal with students questioning the fundamental basis of that approach to literary criticism. 
 
Kuhn, however, also points out that paradigms are often flawed. 
 
So, undeterred, I politely peppered my professor with questions to try to better understand his intellectual paradigm. Just to be clear, there is a correct answer you want us to accept, I asked. “Correct.” What about rigorous biblical scholarship claiming, for instance, that Moses did, in fact, write the vast majority of the Pentateuch? “That doesn’t exist.” It does, I argued. “I don’t want people who are going to disagree with me all semester,” he repeated. I thought a university was an environment in which multiple viewpoints and debates were encouraged, I countered. “Not in this classroom” came the maddeningly smug response. 
 
After the class, I was left shaking my head, a mixture of indignation, sadness, confusion and frustration exploding inside me. As I packed up my things, other students came over to me and thanked me for my questions, explaining that they, too, were upset about the professor’s overly harsh attitude toward religion and religious students. We all felt the arrogance of the professor and the injustice of the situation, but did not know what to do about it. 
 
As I have continued to process the encounter over the past year, I have realized that the attitude and ultimatum of my professor troubled me for two major reasons. 
 
First, I was deeply troubled by the hypocrisy of a famously “liberal” school employing such a closed-minded professor. In fact, the professor’s actions ran directly counter to the stated diversity values of the University of California. According to the UCnet website , “Diversity is a defining feature of the University of California and we embrace it as a source of strength. Our differences — of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, socioeconomic status, abilities, experience and more — enhance our ability to achieve the university’s core missions of public service, teaching and research. We welcome faculty, staff and students from all backgrounds and want everyone at UC to feel respected and valued.” Not only did the professor make no effort to value students with academic and religious perspectives differing from his own, but he actively persecuted us, essentially forcing us to drop his class or suffer. 
 
Second, the fact that religious persecution was flaunted so unabashedly by a well-established professor in front of an entire classroom of students — at the premier public university in the world, no less — speaks to a teaching culture that, at best, tacitly acquiesces to his attitude and, at worst, actively encourages it. This was certainly not the first class this professor has taught, nor is he the only professor to openly criticize religion in a UC Berkeley classroom, nor is UC Berkeley the only campus where this type of persecution is a problem. A number of my friends, at UC Berkeley and other universities, have experienced similarly hypocritical discrimination based on their unpopular religious or scholarly perspectives, thanks to a certain “liberal” fundamentalism as narrow-minded as any conservative, religious fundamentalist. Such a deep-seated posture of indifference toward the religious and academic freedom of students — in general, but particularly for those of strong religious faith, who are often the minority — is shameful and outrageous. Everyone deserves a seat at the table. 
 
As Kuhn points out, recourse to criteria outside existing paradigms is essential when two schools of thought are in competition with each other. After all, what better place to explore the intricacies and nuances of competing academic paradigms than the modern university? The permission to explore, think and argue is invaluable in both advancing scholarship and protecting religious freedom. As such, the “liberal” double standard — by which all views and scholarship is permissible and encouraged, except those deemed too traditional, passe or otherwise unpalatable for the sophisticated 21st century thinker — is simply unacceptable at the modern pluralistic university.

5809,"Solar Station Lander is a complete power generation system, which does not require a rooftop.  What is more- you can also build it yourself.
Generating your own solar power at home has never been easier and more affordable than it is at the moment. Technology is improving, governments are giving incentives, and when we add the “feel great” feeling to all that, we get the perfect explanation to why so many people around are already having their solar power generating systems at home.
The most popular home solar power systems are those mounted on house rooftops, although they are only within the reach of house owners, whose roofs are strong enough to hold the panels.
However, the increasing interest in alternative solar power systems have led to the development of quite a number of interesting non-rooftop solar technologies (especially those that you can build yourself) that are giving rooftop solar a good run for its money.
One such system is the Solar Station, a stand-alone solar unit that comes with its own energy storage. In terms of specifications, it has a 600W solar generator, 2000 W inverter and a pack of six batteries, 84 AH each. The unit is a 4′ x 6′ (1.2 x 1.8 meter) shed, which can also be used for storage of things other than energy.
The system is currently available only through the Indiegogo campaign for the modest price of $6800. But, the makers have something else to offer, which is both great news for DIY lovers, and those who cannot spare the bulk sum all at ones. For just $25, all backers receive a detailed digital DIY construction plan, which comes with photos, list of all parts, and extra tips. Schools and nonprofit organizations receive a $5 discount. Additionally, paying $45 will get you a downloadable video of a Solar Station building workshop, while for $500 you can attend a workshop, learn how to do it all, and have a beer and dinner with the makers.
The guys behind the Solar Station hope to raise enough money through their campaign in order to begin delivery across the US in October this year. Check out what they have to offer and give them a boost- but hurry, there are only two weeks left to go.

2616,"Back to Boston...
On Sunday our biggest plan was making the trek over to Fenway for the Red Sox game.  The game didn’t begin until 1:00 so we had time to kill in the morning.  Since we walked all over the city the day before we decided to spend the morning somewhere different - Cambridge.  Harvard had been on our “must see” list, but we weren’t sure if we’d be able to fit it in.  Luckily, we had some time to spare on Sunday morning so we made it happen.  We got up early, walked about a mile to the T station and took the T (Boston’s subway) to Cambridge. Instantly felt smarter as soon as we walked into Harvard Yard, I’m not going to lie.  It was really a beautiful campus and soooo very different from where I went to college.  Case in point - Harvard was established in 1636; UCF (my alma mater) was established in 1963.  Different worlds.  It was cool to see a campus with so much history and heritage.  And Cambridge itself is a cool little town, and home to the only Curious George shop in the world.  Fun fact there.   I even picked up a little souvenir for Jillian... I have also taught her to say “I’m going to Harvard!” whenever she wears the shirt.  It doesn’t hurt to start that early.  Hee. After putzing around Cambridge for a little while, we made our way back to Boston with just enough time to get changed and take a bunch of shameless selfies in Red Sox gear.  Neither of us are Red Sox fans at all, but when in Boston...  (Go Cubs) Once we got that out of our systems, we walked over to another T station to get the train to Fenway.  Two subway experiences in one day!   Fenway was just as awesome as everyone says it is.  So big, so green, so much history.   Our seats were really good but in direct sunlight, so we literally just baked for the first three innings. In need of a reprieve from the sun, we went down under and walked around Fenway for a few innings and ate baseball stadium things like hot dogs and Cracker Jack.   We went back up to our seats for a few more innings and got to sing Take Me Out to the Ballgame and Sweet Caroline and then made our way back to the T.  (They were winning like 6 to 2 when we left) We got back to downtown and wandered around Quincy Market and Faneuil Hall for a bit to pick up souvenirs before returning to our hotel for showers.  Our plan was to have a nice dinner on the North End for our last night.  And that’s exactly what we did.  Even got a little dressed up for the occasion. On Saturday we had scoped out where we wanted to eat and decided on a place called Cafe Florentine on Hanover.  Many of the restaurants on the North End were tiny and had lines wrapped around the block.  I’m sorry but if a restaurant has a line wrapped around the block, it is not a restaurant I want to go to.  Who want to wait that long to eat?  Luckily Cafe Florentine was pretty easy to get into.  We only had to wait for them to clear off a two top before we sat down. The food was really really good.  I had gnocchi and Hubs had spinach lasagna accompanied by the most amazing bread and wine.  It was all very very good.  And then of course afterwards we had to make a pastry run.  Because that’s what you do in Boston.  Since we had been to Mike’s the day before we decided to try Modern. This was the line outside of Modern.  I won’t wait in a restaurant line that’s wrapped around the block, but I will wait in line for pastries for that long.  Twice. Yes, after we got our pastries from Modern, we went over to Mike’s and stood in line there and got more pastries.  Because we’re gluttons.  Hey, when in Boston...   Yes, that is Hubs skipping down the street with his pastry boxes.   Thankfully our mileage tally for the day was over 10 miles, so that helped a bit.

1781,"ENGLEWOOD, Colo., Sept. 3, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- . (NASDAQ:GEVO), has announced that Harbor Marina at Lake Pomme de Terre in Missouri is the first U.S. marina to sell gasoline blended with Gevo's renewable isobutanol at the pump.

Introduction of the initial isobutanol and gasoline fuel blend took place on Wednesday, Sept. 2 on the marina docks, as Gevo, Harbor Marina, boaters, and Mark Piatt, owner of fuel supplier Oil and Octane Shop gathered to celebrate.

Lake Pomme de Terre is located in one of the premier recreational boating regions of the country. Gevo is now working to strategically roll out its marine fuel blend to marinas on other lakes including Lake of the Ozarks and Table Rock Lake, as the company ramps up isobutanol sales to marine, outdoor equipment and off-road vehicle markets.

Oil and Octane Shop of Springfield, Missouri enabled testing of Gevo's isobutanol by supplying test blends to major marine engine manufacturers, such as Mercury Marine. Following the success of these tests, Oil and Octane Shop has been recommending the use of isobutanol to its marina customers, including Harbor Marina.

In June, the National Marine Manufacturers Association (NMMA) officially endorsed isobutanol as a drop-in fuel for marine and recreational boat engines. Gevo's bio-based isobutanol helps meet renewable fuel and clean air standards, while solving concerns that many boaters have with ethanol-blended fuels, which can damage internal engine parts.

Harbor Marina owner Todd Spencer said he made the decision to offer isobutanol-blended gasoline to his recreational boating customers once he concluded that it would be a superior renewable fuel for their boats. Gevo's isobutanol is moisture resistant, does not cause phase separation and helps reduce engine corrosion. It is a highly stable, high octane marine fuel.

""My fuel supplier introduced me to the idea of blending Gevo's renewable isobutanol with the straight, ethanol-free gasoline my marina was previously offering,"" Spencer said. ""At Harbor Marina, we pride ourselves on providing the best in entertainment, food and beverages – and now we can add: the best-in-marine fuel.""

""I thank the Harbor Marina team for helping us to launch the marine market for isobutanol in this key region of the country,"" said Dr. Patrick Gruber, Chief Executive Officer of Gevo. ""I look forward to seeing commercial marine sales of our proprietary biofuel increase dramatically when word gets out about the benefits of isobutanol as a clean, high-performing, renewable fuel source that boaters can rely on. It's fun to prove to people that biofuels can deliver high performance – it's a new paradigm."" Gevo is a leading renewable technology, chemical products, and next generation biofuels company. Gevo has developed proprietary technology that uses a combination of synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, chemistry and chemical engineering to focus primarily on the production of isobutanol, as well as related products from renewable feedstocks. Gevo's strategy is to commercialize bio-based alternatives to petroleum-based products to allow for the optimization of fermentation facilities' assets, with the ultimate goal of maximizing cash flows from the operation of those assets. Gevo produces isobutanol, ethanol and high-value animal feed at its fermentation plant in Luverne, MN. Gevo has also developed technology to produce hydrocarbon products from renewable alcohols. Gevo currently operates a biorefinery in Silsbee, TX, in collaboration with South Hampton Resources Inc., to produce renewable jet fuel, octane, and ingredients for plastics like polyester. Gevo has a marquee list of partners including The Coca-Cola Company, Toray Industries Inc. and Total SA, among others. Gevo is committed to a sustainable bio-based economy that meets society's needs for plentiful food and clean air and water.

281,"Footage from cockpit cameras in the  vintage jet involved in the Shoreham disaster has revealed the  aircraft showed ""no abnormal indications"" during the flight, according to  air crash investigators. 
 
The interim report  by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) also noted that the video showed the 1950s Hawker Hunter jet ""appeared to be responding to the pilot's control inputs"". 
 
Eleven people died when the plane  plummeted on to the A27 in West  Sussex during the Shoreham Airshow on August 22. 
 
The jet failed to pull out of a loop-the-loop stunt before crashing on to the road, exploding into a fireball. 
 
The pilot, Andrew Hill,  was left fighting for his life and has been moved to a specialist hospital for treatment. 
 
The AAIB said the plane went into the manoeuvre at 200 feet. 
 
David Learmount, a former pilot and RAF flying instructor, claimed the crash would not have happened if the plane had started at a higher altitude. 
 
He told the Press Association:  ""When you go into a vertical manoeuvre you tend to go out of it in the same height you go in, but it's easy to come out of it slightly lower - you don't have to take much of a misjudgement to do that. 
 
""If you go into it low you have reduced the room for error."" 
 
Mr Learmount, who is consulting editor of Flightglobal online magazine, added: "" If he had been 500 feet when he entered the manoeuvre and done exactly the same thing 11 people would be alive today."" 
 
The AAIB found that the pilot and his seat were thrown from the cockpit as the plane hit the ground.  The investigation has not yet determined whether this was caused by an attempted ejection or the impact of the crash. 
 
According to the interim report the Hawker Hunter was not fitted with a flight recorder but there were  two ""image recording cameras"" mounted within the cockpit. 
   Promoted stories   
One was located between the two seats, giving a partial view of the pilot and instrument panel, as well as a view through the cockpit canopy and windscreen. 
 
The report stated: ""To date no abnormal indications have been identified. 
 
""Throughout the flight, the aircraft appeared to be responding to the pilot's control inputs."" 
 
The other camera was mounted at the base of the windscreen looking over the nose. 
 
The preliminary report noted that investigators have  received a ""large amount"" of video and photographs of the aircraft from various locations around Shoreham Airport, where the airshow was taking place. 
 
Many of these are in  high definition and will be analysed in a bid to determine the parameters of the jet's manoeuvres, including flight path and speed. 
 
The AAIB said  the pilot carried out a pre-flight inspection before taking off from North Weald Airfield, Essex, to fly to Shoreham and there were ""no reported defects"". 
 
The document added: ""The pilot was described as being in good spirits and looking forward to the flight."" 
 
Most of the aircraft w reckage has been recovered and sent to the AAIB's headquarters in Farnborough, Hampshire. Work continues to locate some small pieces of the plane.

1. New York City and Pensacola, FL, will test overnight truck deliveries in a new U.S. Department of Transportation pilot program to help reduce congestion on city streets. DOT believes that lighter commuter traffic and more available parking overnight will make delivery easier for truck drivers. DOT plans to use grants totaling $200,000 to test its theories in the two pilot cities. If the pilot is successful, DOT said it believes a similar approach could be adopted in other areas of the country. 
 
2. Paul Trombino III, Iowa DOT director, has been elected president of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), the association announced. AASHTO also elected David Bernhardt, commission of Maine’s DOT, as its vice president. According to AASHTO, Trombino plans to continue pursuing the association’s policy priorities, including Congressional action on a new transportation bill. Trombino said his primary focus will be ensuring the association is well positioned to serve its member departments. 
 
3. USA Truck has appointed Martin Tewari as its president of trucking , Market Watch reports. Tewari will be responsible for the company’s trucking operations, pricing and sales. He will report to the company’s president and CEO Tom Glaser. According to the report, Tewari has more than 25 years of experience in the transportation industry and he joins USA Truck from Con-way Truckload, where he served as vice president of operations. 
 
4. According to a report in the American Journal of Transportation, Absolute Worldwide Logistics announced that it has acquired online trucking portal Shipmymachinery.com. The report states that the online portal provides transportation lead generation services relating to capital equipment and machinery to the transportation industry throughout North America. 
 
5. A group of rest stops in Indiana will be demolished and closed under The Indiana Toll Road’s new plan for its 10 rest stops , according to NWI Times.

1136,"Firms staging mergers often do so in the light of significant benefit; the two firms can better work together to offer services to clients, or just reach an expanded marketplace with a better package. There's often a lot of value in mergers, though there are sometimes legal issues associated with this concept that need to be addressed. For BayRing Communications and Oxford Networks, meanwhile, a merger looked like a great idea, and has already received state and federal approval to go forth. 
 



 
The combination makes plenty of sense at first blush, and deeper inspection proves to change little. BayRing is a New Hampshire firm specializing in telecom and data center operations, while Maine's Oxford Networks joins in on telecom services as well. The two companies will reportedly make the largest telecom firm with a New England headquarters once it's all said and done, offering around 2,000 route miles of high-capacity fiber optics and access to nearly 50,000 commercial buildings. That doesn't include four Service Organization Control data centers, as well as the direct access to several major hub data locations. Just to top it off, its service ranges from southern New Hampshire into metro Boston and beyond. 

 
Results are already quite telling; reports suggest that the new organization's revenue streams have doubled, and now, a large swath of New England has a major new figure in both voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) and hosted private branch exchange ( PBX ( News - Alert ) ) systems. Operations won't change much as a result, as for the time being, both will keep current names and remain in current locations. 

 
This is a pretty big move; it's always noteworthy when two smaller companies get together to make a much larger firm. Economies of scale can improve, and the two companies can focus marketing efforts instead of having to compete. Plus, since there's some difference between the two companies' offerings already, it can offer up a wider range of services to both of its current customer bases. This makes each firm more valuable to its current customers as services it previously couldn't offer can now be had, potentially making for a one-stop-shopping experience for current users. After all, if someone's already writing two checks to two different companies, and one of these can suddenly offer the services offered by the other, why not make the switch and just write one check? That saves time and effort, and when time and effort are saved at a corporate level, saving money generally isn't far behind. That increased fiber concept isn't unwelcome, either, as the rapidly-increasing demand for bandwidth on nearly every front will require fiber access to keep up with it. 

 
There's a lot to like in the merger between BayRing Communications and Oxford Networks, and there will likely be plenty of customers that are equally happy about the whole thing. Competitors in the region, though, may have to step up current operations in order to match the proposition this newly-merged entity will be able to offer.

1292,"HALIFAX, N.S.  — One would think it would be an oxymoron to use the words “economical” and “pickup truck” in the same sentence.   
 

                            But don’t tell the folks at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), who are touting their Ram 1500 EcoDiesel as the antithesis of the traditional gas-guzzling pickup.    
 

                            To demonstrate this fact, FCA Canada took us down to the Maritimes to drive a sampling of 2015 Ram EcoDiesel models and discover just how fuel-efficient they can be.    
 

                            After all, Natural Resources Canada fuel consumption ratings are one thing and real-world driving is another.   
 

                            The exercise was for four teams of two drivers to spend a half-day each in one of four Ram EcoDiesel vehicles, all with different trim levels. At the end of the two days the fuel economy numbers for all the vehicles would be tabulated to see how we fared.    
 

                            The drive route started in Fredericton, N.B. early on a Wednesday morning, eventually heading to the picturesque Bay of Fundy area and then to the Confederation Bridge, which links New Brunswick to Prince Edward Island.    
 

                            After an evening in Charlottetown, PEI, we headed to the Wood Islands ferry that would take us to Nova Scotia with our end point being the beautiful city of Halifax.   
 

                            It was a wonderful drive with awesome scenery, wonderful vistas, friendly locals and some challenging roads.    
 

                            There was quite a mixture of driving routes, but as much as possible we hugged the coastline to see the breathtaking scenery.    
 

                            It was a nice test that demonstrates you don’t have to have a sedan, SUV or sports car to enjoy a driving holiday in this great country of ours. A fuel-efficient pickup like the Ram 1500 EcoDiesel will do quite nicely, thank you.   
 

                            At the end of the day, the numbers tell the story. We visited three provinces, drove between 747.5 to 839.9 kilometres on a single tank of fuel and the fuel consumption numbers ranged from 8.6L/100 km to 9.3L/100 km, averaging 8.85.    
 

                            That’s almost dead on the 8.8L/100 km EnerGuide highway number from the Government of Canada and our driving was a combination of both highway and city driving.    
 

                            Pretty impressive numbers when you consider the size and the weight of these pickups that have a lot to offer the consumer who needs a truck for hauling or towing. And even if it’s just occasionally that you really need the utility of a pickup, with this EcoDiesel you’re not being penalized in the pocketbook.   
 

                            Even after two days of driving through three provinces, we still had plenty of fuel left in the tanks, enough at least for another half day on the road and more than 1,200 kilometres in total on a tank of diesel fuel.   
 

                            And for those unfamiliar with new breed of diesel, these aren’t the smoke belching, clattering engines of old. They are clean, quiet and smoke free.    
 

                            The Ram 1500 is the only full-size, light-duty pickup on the market to offer a diesel powertrain. And it has been a popular option with customers as about one in four Ram 1500s sold in Canada this year is an EcoDiesel. As you move up the trim line, as many as 50 per cent of the high-end Laramie, Longhorn and Limited models have been diesel.   
 

                            One wonders why other manufacturers haven’t gone this route, but FCA executives will be happy to have this market all to themselves. It has made Ram the second best-selling vehicle in the country and FCA’s top-selling model. At the end of August, Ram sales numbers sit at 62,487, a jump of seven per cent over 2014.   
 

                            While you save at the fuel pumps, the Ram EcoDiesel is not inexpensive. Prices start at $39,295 (the EcoDiesel engine itself has an MSRP of $4,700) and the engine is available on all regular, quad or crew cabs.    
 

                            The 3.0-litre turbocharged V6 EcoDiesel is paired with an eight-speed transmission and makes 240 hp and a class-leading 420 lb/ft of low-end torque. If you have to haul a boat or trailer, it has an impressive tow rating of 4,713 kg (9,200 lb).   
 

                            The engine itself is built by VM Motori, an Italian manufacturer that has been a Chrysler supplier since 1992. The company was purchased outright by Fiat in 2013.   
 

                            One model we tested is the high-end Laramie Limited in 4x4 Crew Cab format. It’s pricey, $71,760 as tested, but comes with all the bells and whistles like leather upholstery, dual zone climate control, chrome bumpers, heated first and second-row seats and ventilated front row seats. Four-wheel-drive is available on all trim levels and one feature that many buyers might find desirable is the optional four-corner air suspension ($1,695). With this system, the truck can be raised if you need more clearance and lowered for ease of entry and exit. At speed, the truck is automatically lowered for better aerodynamics and load leveling is also automatic.   
 

                            Other models we tested included the, Big Horn 4x4 Crew Cab, Outdoorsman Quad Cab 4x4 and a Ram 1500 SLT Crew Cab 4x4. There are a multitude of variations, so visit www.ramtruck.ca for all the details.   
 

                            The Ram 1500 is a popular choice among pickup buyers with any powertrain, but if fuel economy is your prime consideration then the 1500 EcoDiesel is the vehicle for you.

Will the VMAs drama ever end? 

Pink isn't feeling red in the face after comments she allegedly made on a private Instagram went public. The 35-year-old singer-songwriter made headlines Thursday after she reportedly weighed in on the  earlier that week, confessing to a fan she felt ""embarrassed,"" ""sad"" and ""old"" while watching this year's show. ""In all seriousness; I felt sad because music is supposed to inspire. It saved my life. This trash won't save any kids life. In a world that is even scarier and with lives still worth saving, who will stand up and have soul?"" she asked. ""Disenfranchised to say the least. Let down by my industry and peers."" 

Pink then name-dropped a few acts, writing, ""Beside Macklemore and Pharrell and [ Justin ] Bieber (pre-sob fest) and The Weeknd , Tori Kelly was dope too. The rest was gross and embarrassing and hard for this aging pop star to believe."" 

E! News reached out to Pink's rep to confirm or clarify her comments Thursday. 
 Kevin Mazur/MTV1415/WireImage   
Right or wrong, many people assumed the ""Just Give Me a Reason"" singer was slamming host Miley Cyrus , as well as performers and pop peers Iggy Azalea , Demi Lovato , Nicki Minaj and Taylor Swift , as she didn't offer them any praise. 

Publicly, Pink trashed the annual awards show, , ""I'm convinced MTV just bought up all dispensaries before airing this show."" Pink did give props to one performer, though, , ""Ok @ToriKelly - fan for life. Great freaking performance tonight, you live singing, guitar playing accapella sanging woman."" 

After her alleged Instagram comments made the rounds, Pink defended herself via  that night. ""Please look for a feud elsewhere. I have no issue with Demi Lovato or anyone else. I actually forgot she performed. I have opinions. MANY,"" she told her followers, , ""I stand by what I said. However, I didn't intend for the angry people of the world to latch on and make it into something it isn't. Peace."" 

Pink then retweeted several supportive messages: 

@Pink Pink doesn't play the trashy tabloid game and is in a league of her own so you're bitchy tweets are meaningless. You cannot touch her.

Thank you Warmoth Guitar Products for making this nostalgic guitar for me! When I was 9 years old, I saw the movie, The Last Waltz, about THE BAND’s final concert. Seeing Robbie and Clapton made me want to become a lead guitarist. For this movie, Robbie Robertson had his guitar dipped in bronze, which I thought looked so cool. Every time I see it, it brings back the same feelings I had the first time I saw The Last Waltz, and dreamed of being a lead guitarist.
I wanted to have a replica of this guitar, so I asked Warmoth if they could do it. Christina Hudson wrote me back saying they would be happy to. Aaron Cheney wanted to do it for free, and my buddy, Jeff Kiesel at Carvin, gave the okay.
Christina first tried to find some guitar painters who could make it look just like bronze, but she finally thought that we should have it dipped in bronze, just like Robbie had done. She found a place that Robbie’s son had used to bronze his guitar. It looked exactly right!
Christina and Warmoth nailed every detail; the bronze body, the middle and bridge pickups put together, and the Telecaster knobs on a Strat.
Thanks to my friend, Brian Acuff, I had the neck already.
I can’t thank Warmoth enough for this beautiful gift, which brings back the great memories of when I first fell in love with the electric guitar. I also thank my awesome guitar company, Kiesel Guitars Carvin Guitars, for letting Warmoth do this for me.",3daf24f9-b9b3-4e7b-af07-2b50911b0770,Blog,2015-09-09T20:25:50Z,Truth In Shredding,Jason Becker: with a stunning bronze Warmoth Guitar for Jason's collection,1.0,News

  WASHINGTON - Landfill disposal rates in the US at 262 million tonnes a year in 2012 is more than double what has been estimated by the federal Environmental Protection Agency, according to a study by three US environmental scientists. 
The study report published Monday in Nature Climate Change, states that the volume of waste in landfills, a major source of the potent greenhouse gas methane, was grossly underestimated in the United States in 2012. 
 
Landfill disposal of municipal solid waste represents one of the largest anthropogenic global methane emission sources. Recent policy approaches have targeted significant reduction of these emissions to combat climate change in the US. 
 
The study found that as against 122 million tons of garbage estimated to have been dumped in 2012 by the EPA, there was around 262 million tons of garbage dumped in landfills that year, the environmental scientists wrote. 
 
""This suggested that methane emissions, from the decomposition of municipal waste at these dumps, was also undercounted,"" the report states. 
 
The scientists claimed to have used a different methodology which was the ""most accurate for the US so far"" than the EPA. 
 
The efficacy of active gas collection systems in the US was also examined by the scientists by analyzing performance data, including fire occurrence, from more than 850 landfills. 
 
The study's primary goal was to learn more about the efficiency of methane capture systems at landfills, which are more effective after a landfill stops accepting new waste, said study co-author Jon T. Powell, a Yale doctoral student. 
 
""When a landfill reaches the end of its life, an engineered cap or barrier system is installed to seal off the waste material from the environment,"" Powell said. 
 
""Open landfills typically have some areas that are 'closed' in this manner, but also have areas that do not have permanent caps, and it is more difficult to extract methane and other gases that are generated in these areas."" 
 
The study found that gas collection systems at closed landfills were significantly more efficient and on average 17 percentage points more efficient than those at open landfills, but open landfills were found to represent 91 percent of all landfill methane emissions. ""These results demonstrate the clear need to target open landfills to achieve significant near-term methane emission reductions,"" states the report. 
 
Landfills represent the third-largest, man-made source of methane in the United States -- about 18 percent of domestic emissions, according to the report. 
 
Methane lives for a shorter time in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), the most abundant greenhouse gas (GHG), but traps far more of the heat radiated from Earth's surface. 
 
The scientists calculated that the average rate of landfill waste disposal was increasing at a rate of about 0.3 percent per year. 
 
The underestimation of the waste disposal and the emission in the United States has raised the spectre of similar miscalculations in the rest of the world. 
 
""A high reliance on land filling has been observed in the EU (European Union) and in developing nations, similar to the US,"" wrote the researchers. 
 
""Improving the collection of LFG at open landfills, must be a target for policymakers, researchers and practitioners to achieve near-term GHG emission reductions in the waste sector.""",77945c77-4035-4913-bd85-63449267fb2e,News,2015-09-21T23:59:56Z,BostonNews.Net,"GHG emission from US landfills underestimated, finds new report",0.0,News
678,"The trial of former Hey Dad! star Robert Hughes was not fair because he was the subject of ""poisonous and vile"" social media posts, the NSW appeals court has heard. The trial of former Hey Dad! star Robert Hughes was not fair because he was the subject of ""poisonous and vile"" social media posts, the NSW appeals court has heard. Hughes is appealing against his conviction and sentence for sexual and indecent assaults on young girls in the 1980s, arguing his trial was a miscarriage of justice.

NSW District Court Judge Peter Zahra sentenced Hughes to a non-parole period of six years, with a maximum term of 10 years, after a jury found him guilty in April last year.

Hughes' barrister, Phillip Boulten, SC, told the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal on Monday that the trial miscarried in part because of pre-trial publicity and commentary on social media.

""This was a case where there was ... poisonous vilification of [Hughes] not by mainstream media, but by very persuasive social media that involved the most poisonous and vile publicity from which no one could ever recover.

""There was a deliberate attempt made by people on social media to poison the well. A lot of the material that was published [was] deliberately contemptuous.""

Mr Boulten said there were social media posts about Hughes, which received ""millions and millions of views"".

Many of the posts were designed to vilify the actor, and did so, the barrister said.

Justice Margaret Beazley, the president of the NSW Court of Appeal, queried whether the court should consider social media posts and mainstream media coverage separately.

""The mainstream media coverage was comprehensive ... that might be one thing that's not unusual.

""Social media is another thing. I think we need to look at it separately at least in the first instance.

""You're going to have to show how social media impacted on the trial.

""One [form of coverage] was likely to trigger the other. Apart from that, I don't know if there was any connection.""

Mr Boulten also gave a detailed history about one of the complainants in the Hughes trial giving paid media interviews in 2010.

The court heard the woman and another prosecution witness gave interviews to Channel Nine's A Current Affair and to Woman's Day magazine, in a publicity deal organised by agent Steve Moriarty.

""[The woman] signed a one-year publicity agreement with him and she was involved in a number of interviews where she received a payment and he received a commission,"" Mr Boulten said.

Hughes, who is in Goulburn jail, did not appear in court for his appeal, and did not wish to be on audio-visual link.

The appeal continues before Justice Beazley, Justice Monika Schmidt and Justice Richard Button. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.",f762ab71-a35f-4998-a4d5-41c82796df45,News,2015-09-28T03:06:24Z,Southern Weekly,Hey Dad! actor Robert Hughes subject of 'poisonous and vile' social media: appeal,0.0,News

1488,"James Taylor's maiden international hundred helped England reach 300 for the first time in their Royal London Series campaign against Australia. 
 
		 
Taylor (101) was one of three batsmen to top 50 as the hosts, needing to beat the world champions at Old Trafford to avoid a series defeat with two matches remaining, set 300 for eight after winning the toss. 
  James Taylor celebrates his maiden international century   
Opener Jason Roy (63) and Eoin Morgan (62) - in a stand of 119 with Taylor - were the other major contributors after England chose to bat first on an initially cloudy but soon much brighter afternoon. 

			 
Taylor had to work hard, coming of age with three figures in his 21st one-day international - a 112-ball hundred which contained 46 runs in singles and just five fours. 



 
It was Roy who put the pace to the innings and number three Taylor took over with much scurrying and placement to post a competitive total on a decent pitch. 

Alex Hales could never get going at the top of the order before clipping a catch to midwicket in Pat Cummins' first over. 

But Roy batted beautifully, unfurling a stream of boundaries including four in one over from Mitchell Starc, and it was his first false shot that cost him. 

He passed 50 in just 34 balls and thought he had spotted another boundary option off ODI debutant Ashton Agar but just failed to put enough into the shot to chip cover, where Glenn Maxwell jumped high to hold a juggling catch. 

			 
Both Morgan and Taylor had a little fortune on their side, the captain most notably when he should have been stumped off Agar on 15 and his partner surviving an lbw appeal by Maxwell on 41 which would have been overturned had Australia chanced DRS. 

Taylor did not count a boundary until he square-drove the 53rd ball he faced from James Pattinson, and had just that four to his name in his first 50. 

Morgan got to his half-century more quickly, from just 46 balls, as the third-wicket pair provided a perfect platform of 181 for two at 30 overs. 

Thereafter, England stalled as the apparent possibility of 350 or above faded significantly and four wickets - including two run-outs - fell for the addition of 64 runs in the last 10 overs. 

			 
Taylor nonetheless managed to complete his hundred, with a scrambled single off Cummins, before he was last out in the final over, mistiming the expensive Starc to mid-off.

2648,"OTTAWA — Fresh data showing that Canada's economy now meets the definition of a recession sent immediate ripples across the federal election campaign trail this morning. 
 

                            Statistics Canada reported that the economy contracted at an annual pace of 0.5 per cent in the second quarter of 2015. It's the second straight quarter of contraction, fitting the technical definition of a recession. 
 

                            But Stephen Harper tried to find a silver lining — the Conservative leader seized on the agency's finding that the economy began to bounce back in June as GDP grew by 0.5 per cent after shrinking over five straight months. 
 

                            ""Elsewhere there's growth, and today one of the greatest monthly growths occurred in June, so it's clear that the Canadian economy is growing,"" the prime minister said in Burlington, Ont. where he pledged new support for Canadian manufacturers. 
 

                            Harper said the Conservative plan of a balanced budget, low taxes and affordable investments was the best course for the country in the face of greater global problems. 
 

                            ""If we change plans, we'll have a permanent recession like is occurring in many other countries. We're on the right track,"" the prime minister said. 
 

                            But New Democrat candidate Andrew Thomson, a former Saskatchewan finance minister, says today's numbers mean Conservative economic policies aren't working. 
 

                            ""The forecast today confirms that Stephen Harper is presiding over Canada's second recession in only seven years,"" Thomson told a press conference in Ottawa, while NDP Leader Tom Mulcair was in British Columbia for events later in the day. 
 

                            ""This is not about one day's statistics,"" he added. ""Under Stephen Harper, this has been Canada's lost decade."" 
 

                            He accused Harper's government of 10 years of job losses, allowing infrastructure to crumble and for giving tax breaks to the wealthy while the middle class struggles. 
 

                            Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau said he agreed with a suggestion that the size of the recession might be marginal. But he said the bigger picture is that Canadians are struggling in an economy being hampered by low growth. 
 

                            Trudeau said Canadians have been living with the reality of a weak economy for months now, and don't need official numbers to confirm what they already know. 
 

                            ""What they would have needed is that politicians rather than getting hung up on definitions, invest in their future and in their jobs,"" Trudeau said in Gatineau, Que. 
 

                            Trudeau reiterated his platform plank — which distinguishes the Liberals from the Conservatives and the NDP — to run deficits before balancing the budget in 2019 in order to spur growth by investing infrastructure. 
 

                            ""That's why our plan will invest in real growth and isn't really dependent on this morning's announcement.""

The patent for invention number 9,106,958 entitled ""Video Recommendation Based On Affect"" is for software that analyzes a person's emotional reaction to media content and makes recommendations based on that emotional response. Someone could watch a video and, rather than capture a response by clicking on a star or ""thumbs up"" rating, that person's true, moment-by-moment emotional reaction is captured while the video is playing. Then other content is suggested based on the mood that was elicited by the prior viewing. For example, content provided by YouTube™, Netflix™, Hulu™, or other media publishers could be emotionally ranked as they are watched by numerous people. These emotional responses then serve as input to video recommendation engines. This broad patent also covers the application of emotion-based recommendations in games, movies, educational content, and various other media. 

This invention enables Affectiva to provide the next generation of content feedback, transforming not only how we review, rank and rate digital content, but also how publishers and social platforms will serve up content recommendations.

""We are inundated with videos and other types of digital experiences. The abundance of digital media makes it hard for us to pick from all these choices,"" says Dr. Rana el Kaliouby, co-Founder and Chief Strategy and Science Officer at Affectiva. ""Our emotions are great drivers of interest, and now with Affectiva's technology, we can get recommendations based on our emotional engagement, truly personalizing our digital experiences.""

Affectiva has already commercialized some of these capabilities, specifically the ability to measure and analyze at scale a person's emotional response to digital content. In use by over 1,400 brands today, including Unilever™, Mars™, Kellogg's™ and CBS™, Affectiva's emotion algorithms are built on its massive emotion data repository of more than 3.3 million faces analyzed in 75 countries.

This new patent expands Affectiva's patent portfolio to include in excess of 50 issued patents and pending applications in the US. The portfolio covers emotion enablement of computing devices, mobile technology, wearables, and the Internet of Things being applied to digital experiences, mobile apps, gaming, consumer and business applications, market research, and the Internet. Affectiva has developed a robust patenting strategy that is managed dynamically and empowers all employees to develop patenting ideas for review.

A random attack by a man wielding a bread crate has left another man in hospital after an altercation at Hornsby railway station on Saturday morning. 

At about 3.20am a 36-year-old man was walking through the the station concourse near Hornsby Westfield shopping centre when he crossed paths with another man who was not known to him. 

The unknown man picked up a plastic bread crate and used it to crack the 36-year-old over the head, police said. 

The assailant then punched the man several times before running off towards George Street. 

The injured man collapsed on the ground. 

Sydney Rail staff and a passerby found the man and waited with him until emergency services arrived. 

He was taken to the Royal North Shore Hospital with minor injuries as a result of the assault, and remained in hospital to be treated for a pre-existing condition by Sunday afternoon.

… Foe Pause …  
 
No DirecTV deal with Pac-12 this season 
 
From Jon Wilner and the San Jose Mercury News … The Pac-12 Networks won’t be on DirecTV anytime soon. 
 
The conference has rejected a proposal by DirecTV’s parent company, AT&T, that would have allowed carriage on the satellite provider but come at an enormous cost to the conference, a source said Saturday. 
 
The league’s presidents and chancellors determined that AT&T’s requests would have compromised the networks’ business model and long-term profitability without granting enough in return. 
 
The networks are wholly owned by the league, in contrast to counterparts at the Big Ten (co-owned by FOX) and SEC (co-owned by ESPN). 
 
The proposal by AT&T, which took control of DirecTV this summer,  likely would have forced the Pac-12 Networks to redo their existing distribution deals (with Comcast, DISH, etc.) at a lower subscription rate, jeopardizing future profits.

Colorado remains at No. 11 in ESPN Power Rankings …  
 
From ESPN … The bottom three (CU jumped over Oregon State, which lost to Michigan, but was jumped by Washington State, which defeated Rutgers) … 
 
10. Washington State Cougars : Oh Cougs … what to make of you. You lose at home to an FCS team. Then you go on the road and beat a Big Ten team. Football totally makes sense. Glad you took last week’s advice. 
 
  
 
11. Colorado Buffaloes : The Buffs snapped a nine-game losing streak and did so with one of their best rushing outputs in almost a decade. I think we got a glance of what this team could be. Question is, can it do it consistently against stiffer competition? 
 
12. Oregon State Beavers : They looked great on their opening drive … and then it all went to Hades. That was a tough encore for a team trying to rebuild its identity under a new coach. Best to learn from mistakes (and some would include the coaches in that conversation ) and move on. The San Jose State game is more than winnable with Stanford and conference play on the horizon.

Ohio State loses two No. 1 votes to Michigan State in latest poll … Oregon out of the top ten; UCLA in 
 
From ESPN … Three Southeastern Conference teams fell out of the Associated Press Top 25 on Sunday, and the Auburn Tigers dropped 12 spots after the league that set a record for most teams in the college football rankings last week had a rough weekend. 
 
Arkansas, Tennessee and Mississippi State all fell out after losses Saturday. The Tigers needed overtime to beat Jacksonville State of the FCS; they slipped from No. 6 to No. 18. 
 
Auburn will get a chance at redemption next week as the Tigers visit No. 13 LSU. 
 
The SEC was down to seven ranked teams, still the most of any conference. The Pac-12 was next with five. 
 
Ohio State remains No. 1, but the Buckeyes are no longer unanimous. No. 4 Michigan State receives two first-place votes after beating Oregon  31-28 . Alabama remains No. 2. TCU is 3. 
 
… The Pac-12 … Five Pac-12 teams are ranked in the Associated Press Top 25 poll for the second consecutive week, with USC moving up to No. 6, UCLA claiming the No. 10 spot, Oregon falling to 12th, Arizona jumping to 20th and Utah to 21st. 
 
Here’s the AP Top 25 in full: 
  Ohio State (59 first-place votes)  Alabama  TCU  Michigan State (2)  Baylor  USC  Georgia  Notre Dame  Florida State  UCLA  Clemson  Oregon  LSU  Georgia Tech  Ole Miss  Oklahoma  Texas A&M  Auburn  BYU  Arizona  Utah  Missouri  Northwestern  Wisconsin  Oklahoma State

Oregonian: Missed pass in the final minute “changes course of Oregon’s season” 
 
From the Oregonian …  It wasn’t the play that lost the game that rolled through Vernon Adams Jr.’s head like a skipping record, spitting phrases like, “I got to be better,” from his mouth on repeat in the postgame. 
 
It was two plays before he threw an incomplete pass to Bralon Addison on fourth-and-long that sealed up Michigan State’s 31-28 victory Saturday night at Spartan Stadium. 
 
It was the play that should have won it for the Ducks that will stick with Adams long after the biggest game of his college football career. 
 
“Definitely that one to Byron when he was wide-open,” Adams said. “You know, I can’t stop thinking about that. He was wide-open and you got to make that throw and the game is different.” 
 
The fifth-year senior, in his first month with the Ducks, wasn’t underselling it. The Ducks were down by three in the final minutes of the game and charging up field. The defense, the gassed and battered defense, made the stand it needed to make and the Ducks were facing second-and-six with a host of options and a bag of timeouts.

Oregon State starts fast, but then is dominated by Michigan in 35-7 loss 
 
From ESPN … Michigan (1-1) looked much better as a team than it did in last week’s loss at Utah. 
 
The Wolverines also got some breaks in the pivotal second quarter against the Beavers (1-1). 
 
Smith gave the Wolverines a running game they lacked in the opener, but like his coach, he wouldn’t take credit. 
 
“Want to give a shout out to my offensive line,” Smith said. “They opened some holes you could drive a bus through.” 
 
Defensively, Michigan put pressure on Oregon State’s quarterbacks and didn’t give up a lot on the ground — much to the delight of nearly 110,000 fans who filled the Big House with hopes the sagging program’s new leader will make a difference. 
 
Harbaugh was quietly pacing the sideline for much of the first quarter and early in the second, rarely saying anything to players, coaches or officials. 
 
That changed when he saw a penalty he didn’t like. The game changed, too. 
 
Michigan’s Jeremy Clark was called for roughing the kicker, setting off Harbaugh. 
 
The former San Francisco 49ers coach shouted at officials, flailed his arms and threw laminated sheets behind him because he thought Nick Porebski lost his protection as a punter after bobbling the ball and zig-zagging before kicking the ball. 
 
A little later, Oregon State coach Gary Andersen made a curious decision by choosing to punt instead of going for it on a fourth-and-3 from the Michigan 39 while trailing 10-7. 
 
“Never thought to not punt quite frankly,” Andersen said. 
 
Then, the long snap from midfield sailed over Porebski’s head and bounced back to the Beavers 3. 
 
“That happens once in a half-century,” Harbaugh said. “That was a heck of a good break for us, but we’ll take it.” 
 
Smith scored his second TD with 12 seconds left in the first half to put Michigan up 17-7 and the Beavers never got back in the game.

Washington State bounces back with a 37-34 win over Rutgers with touchdown in final minute 
 
From ESPN …   Luke Falk led a 10-play, 90-yard touchdown drive, finding River Cracraft with an eight-yard strike with :13 left to lift Washington State past Rutgers, 37-34 Saturday. 
 
Falk threw for 468 yards and four touchdowns. 
 
While Janarion Grant tried to be the hero for Rutgers, returning two kicks for touchdowns, he couldn’t return the final kickoff for a touchdown. The ball was kicked to Leonte Carroo and Rutgers tried to do their Stanford vs. California impression, before the ball was thrown forward after several laterals. 
 
Grant had the best game of his collegiate career, returning a kickoff and a punt for late touchdowns. With Rutgers trailing 30-27 with 1:45 left, Grant returned a punt 55-yards for a touchdown to give Rutgers the 34-30 lead. The playmaker returned a kickoff 100 yards to give Rutgers its first lead of the game, 27-23 and finished a school record 339 total yards. 
 
Washington State answered Grant’s 100-yard return with an eight play, 82-yard drive in 2:59. Falk hit Gabe Marks, who made a dazzling 23-yard touchdown catch. 
 
On its next two drives Rutgers negated two touchdowns with penalties. Rutgers running back Josh Hicks fumbled on the ensuing drive after catching a screen pass and Isaac Dotson recovered for the Cougars. That came one play after a 21-yard touchdown was negated on a holding penalty on Chris Muller. 
 
The Scarlet Knights defense stopped Washington State on fourth down with 6:10 left, but Justin Goodwin’s offensive pass interference penalty negated a 29-yard touchdown catch by Grant. 
 
The high-scoring second half came after just one touchdown in the first.

Pac-12 proposes athletes profiting off of their own names (in non-athletic ventures) 
 
From CBS Sports … The Pac-12 has submitted a proposal that would allow college athletes to use their names, images and likenesses to “promote their own non-athletic business ventures,” the conference said in a news release Friday. 
 
In light of the pending Ed O’Bannon lawsuit, the Pac-12 idea appears to represent an incremental step by college sports leaders to adopt bylaws allowing players to make money off their name, but with a qualifier. Pac-12 deputy commissioner Jamie Zaninovich said athletes would be able to promote themselves without identifying themselves as an athlete. 
 
Under current NCAA rules, athletes are prohibited from accepting any money for or permitting the use of their name or picture to advertise or promote directly the sale of a commercial product or service. The eligibility of athletes is not affected if they participated in the promotional activity prior to enrollment and meet certain conditions. 
 
The Pac-12 submitted the NILs idea to the NCAA last week as part of the Power Five’s proposals for consideration at the NCAA convention in January. The conferences have until Nov. 15 to amend or finalize their concepts for proposals. NCAA autonomy allows the 65 schools from the ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC, plus Notre Dame, to create their own legislation that the rest of Division I can elect to follow.

ESPN: CU one of five Pac-12 teams which need to “bounce back” in Week Two 
 
From ESPN … Week 1 was not what many people thought it would be for the Conference of Champions. But Week 1 is just that — Week 1 — with plenty of time brush a shaky 7-5 performance under the rug and move on to the next one. 
 
Five teams — Arizona State, Colorado, Stanford, Washington and Washington State — are looking to do just that. Here’s what they have coming up. 
 
… 
 
COLORADO 
  Next opportunity : vs. UMass  What went wrong in Week 1: There are the turnovers, the two missed red zone opportunities, the special teams breakdowns … and, of course, the clock management at the end of the game — which, yes, some of the blame does go to the officials.  What needs to happen in Week 2 : Believe it or not, I still think Colorado is a decent football team — when the Buffaloes are consistent. Eliminating mistakes is easier said than done. We get that. But when everything is clicking, this team still has potential.  Coach speak, Mike MacIntyre : “They saw the bone-headed mistakes. Hopefully they understand the mistakes that we made that cost us the football game. It wasn’t anything Hawaii did. It was what we did. If they can understand that and get things done, we’ll keep playing good.”

ESPN Pac-12 Power Rankings … Colorado No. 11 
 
From ESPN … We now have tangible data to work with. It’s not great. But we have a better picture than we did when we came out with the preseason power rankings. As always, if you don’t like where you’re ranked, play better. 
 
The Bottom Two (just behind No. 10 Stanford) … 
 
11. Colorado Buffaloes: Once again, we were willing to give the Buffs the benefit of the doubt heading into Week 1. Once again, the Buffs disappointed. Say what you want about how that game ended. Colorado should never have been in that spot to begin with. I do think Colorado is better than the product in Hawaii. But the benefit of the doubt is quickly slipping away. 
 
12. Washington State Cougars: Want people to stop saying “They Coug’ed it”? Then stop Coug’ing it.\

Arizona linebacker Scooby Wright out “three-to-four weeks” … (Game against CU October 17th) 
 
From CBS Sports … Arizona star linebacker Scooby Wright III might only miss “three to four weeks” after undergoing minor knee surgery to repair damage from an injury suffered in the Wildcats’ season opener against UTSA on Thursday. 
 
Wright underwent a procedure to repair a lateral meniscus tear in his left knee over the weekend, and on Monday Rich Rodriguez delivered the official timetable for his return. 
 
Wright will still travel with the team, according to Rodriguez, while he recovers. If the timetable works out in Arizona’s favor, Wright could be back on the field for Arizona’s Pac-12 opener against UCLA. Given what we saw from the Bruins, Arizona may need its most aggressive defensive performance to disrupt Josh Rosen’s rhythm under center. 
 
Still, the most important news is that this is expected to be a minor injury that will allow Wright to return to the field this season. Wright has only been playing college football for two years and has already assumed the role of one of the sport’s most exciting playmakers. Last season, he ranked in the top five nationally in tackles, sacks and forced fumbles … and perhaps No. 1 nationally in terrorizing opposing offensive coordinators.

Coug Center – Loss to Portland State “it’s incredibly hard to watch, think about or root for this team” 
 
A good essay from Brian Floyd for Coug Center. It really speaks to fans of teams like Washington State (and Colorado), who continue to believe, and yet are not being rewarded for their continuing devotion. 
 
The full essay (which I recommend) can be found here . Some excerpts: 
 
… Which brings us to Saturday’s season opener. The first game of the season is supposed to be fun, a celebration of college football’s return. Everyone is a blank slate, filled with hope stemming from unknowns. We default to the positive side of those unknowns, no matter how bad the previous season was. Saturday’s game against Portland State was supposed to be easing into the schedule, a tuneup before a road test against Rutgers. College football was coming back, and it was an exciting time. 
 
I was excited about Washington State football this year. It seemed possible that last year was a tad bit of regression after going to a bowl game well ahead of schedule the year before. There was talent, on paper, and a better understanding of the system. The defense was new and fresh, and hey maybe a change at the top of the org chart was needed on that side of the ball. 
 
… There was no reason for the Cougars to get completely gashed on defense. The new look on that side of the ball appears to be “dumpster fire that takes half an hour to get roaring.” The offense still isn’t clicking, and receivers as experienced as Washington State’s shouldn’t be letting so many balls hit the turf (and don’t use weather as an excuse). 
 
… This, however, is about as low as it gets, for me. Losing to an FCS team on opening weekend in a season we were hoping would be a bounce back is a punch in the gut right off the bat. Maybe it gets better and this was a hiccup. But right now, it’s incredibly hard to watch, think about or root for this team. And it’s nearly impossible to believe Leach has this team on the right track. 
 
Welcome back to college football.

UCLA loses star defensive lineman to a torn ACL 
 
From Fox Sports …  Eddie Vanderdoes standout on the UCLA D-line, suffered a torn ACL in the Bruins’ win over Virginia on Saturday, a source told FOX Sports Sunday. Vanderdoes will miss the rest of the 2015 season. 
 
UCLA spokesman Josh Rupprecht confirmed the injury to The Associated Press later Sunday night. 
 
The 6-foot-4, 305-pound junior had a team-high eight tackles in the Bruins’ 34-16 win vs. the Cavaliers. Vanderdoes, who has played in every one of UCLA’s 27 games since arriving on campus, was an honorable-mention All-Pac-12 Conference selection last season. 
 
The Bruins still have All-American candidate Kenny Clark to anchor the D-line, but now 305-pound junior Eli Ankou and 275-pound sophomore Matt Dickerson need to step up in Vanderdoes’ absence.

Washington State, Colorado and USC in USA Today “Misery Index”  
 
From USA Today … (Disclaimer: This isn’t a ranking of worst teams, worst losses or coaches whose jobs are in the most jeopardy. This is simply a measurement of a fan base’s knee-jerk reaction to what they last saw. The way in which a team won or lost, expectations vis-à-vis program trajectory and traditional inferiority complex of fan base all factor into this ranking.) 
 
6. Washington State : Despite his feel-good second season in which he beat Southern California and took the Cougars to a bowl game, Mike Leach’s record at Washington State is 12-26 after Saturday’s loss to FCS member Portland State. 
 
But here’s the really scary thing for Washington State fans: If he can’t fix it, who can? Bottom line: The Cougars don’t have any real excuse for losing to an FCS team in Leach’s fourth season. 
 
It’s not their facilities, which are marvelous. It’s not their head coach, who is accomplished. It’s not their schedule, which has been manageable. And given the way Leach talked about his team in the preseason, it shouldn’t be the talent level. But something is missing, and the Misery Index grants Washington State fans free reign to freak out over the state of this program now that 2015 is already on track to be a disappointment. 
 
7. Colorado : The non-conference trip to Hawaii is among the most alluring setups for a major football program. The idea is to go get a relatively easy win, be able to play a 13th game (an obscure NCAA rule) and enjoy a couple days of paradise with your players, fans and administration. 
 
Of course, that requires you actually winning the game, which Colorado was unable to accomplish in a 28-20 loss. Forget the specifics of what happened at the end — and yes, Colorado fans will forever complain about how quickly the ball was spotted by the officiating crew and the inability to get off one final play that might have given the Buffaloes a chance to tie the game. 
 
But if you take a step back, Colorado probably should be better than a life-or-death struggle at Hawaii if the program is progressing as quickly as Mike MacIntyre hoped. It’s not, and that’s a problem as the Buffaloes face one of the most difficult Pac-12 schedules in league history, facing Oregon and Stanford in crossover games as well as the loaded South division. Colorado’s bowl-less streak of seven seasons appears likely to become eight. 
 
8. Southern California : Few were as critical of head coach Steve Sarkisian’s drunken appearance at the program’s “Salute to Troy” preseason event as USC fans themselves, which is a refreshing departure from the typical mindless fandom the Misery Index sees on a daily basis. But the truth is USC fans know more than anyone that Sarkisian, whether he actually has a drinking problem, most certainly has a propensity to act like a 21-year-old frat boy problem. 
 
And that feeds into the narrative that Sarkisian’s teams will chronically underachieve because they lack the focus, discipline and seriousness to make it through a taxing 12-game schedule without a couple of unnecessary hiccups. So while the Trojans did what was expected in waxing Arkansas State 55-6, it’s a victory that does little to calm the nerves about what’s in store this season. And it certainly doesn’t help that USC fans now realize what they’ll have to deal with in UCLA freshman quarterback Josh Rosen for the next three years.

Arizona linebacker Scooby Wright may be back … in time to play Colorado October 17th 
 
From ESPN … Arizona Wildcats linebacker Scooby Wright had his left knee scoped to repair a lateral meniscus tear, a source confirmed to ESPN’s Brett McMurphy. 
 
The Wildcats hope to “have him back in a month,” the source said. 
 
Wright injured the knee in the first quarter of Thursday night’s 42-32 win over Texas San Antonio. 
 
He hobbled off the field midway through the first quarter. Television cameras later caught trainers icing Wright’s knee on the sideline, where he later walked with a limp and a cane. 
 
Arizona coach Rich Rodriguez is expected to give an update on Wright on Monday, a school spokesman said. The Wildcats visit Nevada on Sept. 12. 
 
Other games Wright is likely to miss include home dates with Northern Arizona on Sept. 19 and No. 13 UCLA on Sept. 26.

Washington State falls to Portland State, 24-17 
 
While no Pac-12 coach was considered to be on the hot seat heading into the 2015 season, the seat just got a little warmer for Mike Leach at Washington State. In his first three seasons, Leach posted a 12-25 record, failing to generate the success he had at Texas Tech. 
 
Make that 12-26. 
 
Portland State from the Big Sky Conference, which had an 0-14 all-time record against FBS schools, defeated the Cougars, 24-17. Washington State had a 10-0 lead at halftime, but the Vikings scored 17 straight points to take the lead early in the fourth quarter. After the Cougars mounted a drive to tie the game, Portland State put together a 14-play, 69-yard touchdown drive to take a 24-17 lead. With less than a minute to play, the Vikings picked off a tipped ball, giving Washington State its first-ever loss to an FCS team

No. 21 Stanford the first ranked team of the falls to Northwestern 
 
From ESPN …  Northwestern wanted to prove a point against No. 21 Stanford, and the Wildcats drove it home with a strong running game and solid defense that produced a season-opening surprise. 
 
Freshman Clayton Thorson ran for a 42-yard touchdown while playing turnover-free ball at quarterback, Justin Jackson added 134 yards rushing, and the Wildcats beat the Cardinal 16-6 on Saturday afternoon. 
 
Anthony Walker broke up two passes and had a fumble recovery, and Kyle Queiro intercepted Kevin Hogan in the end zone with about a minute left to seal the win. 
 
Thorson scored the game’s only touchdown in the second quarter. He also threw for 105 yards, completing 12 of 24 passes. 
 
Jackson rushed 28 times. Jack Mitchell kicked three field goals, including a career-long 49-yarder that made it 16-6 with 3:38 left in the game, and the Wildcats started the season on a winning note for the first time against a ranked team since 1995. 
 
It was just what they needed after back-to-back 5-7 finishes, a run that followed five straight bowl appearances. 
 
Stanford, coming off an 8-5 season that snapped a string of four consecutive BCS bowls, clearly has some work to do. 
 
Hogan had a rough afternoon, going 20-of-35 with 155 yards and an interception. He was sacked three times. 
 
Christian McCaffrey ran for 66 yards, but the Cardinal managed just 240 yards on offense and scored their fewest points since 2007.

Chris Petersen falls to former school in Washington’s loss to Boise State … “I feel physically sick” 
 
From the Seattle Times … So successful at keeping the identity of their starting quarterback a secret all week, the Washington offense was only suspect in the first half of their season opener Friday night. 
 
So to see that offense suddenly find itself driving in the final minute of a dramatic comeback bid, with a chance to tie No. 23 Boise State, well, it was at least a little encouraging. 
 
Right? No, Jake Browning didn’t want to hear it. 
 
“I feel physically sick right now,” he said moments after the Huskies’ 16-13 defeat in Chris Petersen’s return to Boise. 
 
“I mean, it’s hard to answer a question about encouragement when you just lost,” Browning added. “Yeah, there encouraging things there, but at the end of the day you lost. … We only lost by three to a good team, but we want to win. There’s no pity points.” 
 
The Huskies, down 16-0 at halftime, got back in the game thanks key special-teams performances from Dante Pettis (76-yard punt return for a touchdown), Jaydon Mickens (blocked punt) and Cameron Van Winkle (two made field goals). 
 
Washington’s comeback bid ended, however, when the offense stalled at the 29-yard line and Van Winkle missed a 46-yard field-goal attempt wide right with 21 seconds left.

Report: Injury to Scooby Wright will not be season-ending 
 
From ESPN … Arizona linebacker Scooby Wright’s left knee injury is not season-ending, sources told ESPN’s Brett McMurphy. 
 
Wright, who injured the knee in the first quarter of Thursday night’s 42-32 win over Texas San Antonio, underwent an MRI after the game. Results indicate Wright’s injury will not cause him to miss the rest of the season, sources said. 
 
Wright hobbled off the field midway through the first quarter. Television cameras later caught trainers icing Wright’s knee on the sideline, where he later walked with a limp and a cane. 
 
Arizona coach Rich Rodriguez is expected to give an update on Wright on Monday, a school spokesman said. The Wildcats visit Nevada on Sept. 12.

Utah spoils the debut of Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh 
 
From ESPN … Jim Harbaugh was swarmed by cameramen from the moment he stepped off the bus at Rice-Eccles Stadium. College football’s newest rock star had finally arrived to play a game after eight months of hype. 
 
And Utah was sick of hearing about it. 
 
The Utes felt disrespected despite being favored and spoiled Harbaugh’s Michigan coaching debut with a smothering defense, beating the Wolverines 24-17 on Thursday night in the opener for both teams. 
 
“We beat Michigan for the third time in a row,” Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said. “That’s a heck of an accolade for our program.” 
 
Harbaugh came as advertised — blue long-sleeved shirt, blue cap with the block “M,” khakis and lanyard with whistle attached. 
 
Unfortunately for Michigan fans, the team didn’t look drastically different from the 2014 version. The quarterback struggled, and the run game was nonexistent. That spelled trouble for the offense. 
 
“I thought we were playing a little bit tentative in the first half and not coming off the ball like we need to,” Harbaugh said. “We did miss some holes, backs missed some holes. All things to grow and improve on, and I thought we did that as the game went on.” 
 
Harbaugh, the former Michigan quarterback who returned to his alma mater eight months ago after leaving the NFL’s San Francisco 49ers, faced many of the same issues that plagued former coach Brady Hoke. 
 
Quarterback Jake Rudock beat out Shane Morris for the start. An Iowa transfer, Rudock had a reputation for limiting turnovers but promptly threw three interceptions against Utah and finished 27-for-43 for 279 yards and two touchdowns. Michigan was held to 355 yards, gaining only 76 on the ground. Eighty of those yards came on Michigan’s final drive of the game.

No. 22 Arizona gets by UTSA in opener, but may have lost star linebacker Scooby Wright 
 
From ESPN … Arizona struggled defensively, was uneven on offense and had trouble putting away a smaller-conference team at home. 
 
That wasn’t even close to the worst news of the night. Losing All-American linebacker Scooby Wright to a knee injury early in the game trumped it all. 
 
Anu Solomon threw four touchdown passes to help No. 22 Arizona beat UTSA 42-32 Thursday night, but the Wildcats suffered a big blow when Wright went out with a left knee injury. 
 
Wright, who swept the major defensive player of the year awards last season, went out in the first quarter, tried to return and went back out after one play. He spent the second half in street clothes, walking with a cane, and was scheduled to have an MRI Thursday night. 
 
“I don’t think it’s bad — MCL, ACL, whatever — but I don’t want to speculate,” Arizona coach Rich Rodriguez said. “We’ll see what happens.” 
 
Even before Wright went down, Arizona’s defense struggled. The Wildcats scored two defensive touchdowns, but gave up 525 total yards to UTSA, which returned two offensive starters. 
 
The offense was good at times, sputtered others, finished with a pedestrian-for-them 392 total yards. Solomon had with 229 yards on 22-of-26 passing, and Nick Wilson added 97 yards rushing.

University of Washington sells naming rights for Husky Stadium to Alaska Airlines for $41 million 
 
From seattlepi.com … The University of Washington announced a proposal to sell naming rights at Husky Stadium to Seattle-based Alaska Airlines. 
 
The agreement, which is still subject to approval to UW’s Board of Regents, would make the official name of the Huskies’ football home “Alaska Airlines Field at Husky Stadium.” 
 
The airline will pay $41 million for the naming rights for the field, as well as the adjoining “University of Washington Athletic Village presented by Alaska Airlines.” They will also continue their naming rights for Alaska Airlines Arena at Hec Edmundson Pavilion, as well as serve as the official airline of all three UW campuses for the next decade. 
 
“I am thrilled that we can expand on a local connection and enhance a long-standing relationship with a Seattle company who shares our values so deeply,” UW Director of Athletics Scott Woodward said in a statement. “As the costs of funding a first-class student-athlete experience continue to rise, it is critical that we seek new and creative funding opportunities with partners who share our values, and I am pleased because that is exactly what we have done with Alaska Airlines. 
 
“This exciting new agreement will work directly to fund our student-athlete experience and allow us to stay in front of the rising costs of funding student-athlete recruitment, scholarship, travel and competition.”

Jon Wilner at the San Jose Mercury News has published his Pac-12 picks for the week, both picking the winners and whether the Pac-12 team will cover the spread for the game. 
 
For straight up winners, Wilner has the Pac-12 going 10-2, with only Arizona State (Texas A&amp;M) and Washington (Boise State) losing. 
 
The full article can be found here . 
 
As to the Buffs: 
 
COLORADO (minus-7.5) at HAWAII (Friday): Rare deviation from policy of using the opening line, but this swing is too severe to ignore: Colorado opened as a 2.5-point underdog and is now favored by more than a touchdown. And for good reason. Count on a jump in performance from the Buff now that Mike MacIntyre’s recruits occupy more of the 2-deep. Pick: Colorado

And at least once this season, they are going to knock off someone that folks like us say they shouldn’t. I don’t know who. It could be a team from the South or North. But you need only to look at how close Colorado was last year to breaking through. This year, one of those close games will go the Buffs way. – Kevin Gemmell

Oregon State and former head coach Mike Riley sued for “failing to correct a hostile and sexually violent culture” 
 
From the Oregonian … A former student at Oregon State University has filed a federal Title IX lawsuit that accuses the school’s former head football coach Mike Riley of failing to correct a hostile and sexually violent culture among football players that contributed to her being raped. 
 
The woman alleges that she was raped on Oct. 9, 1999, while a freshman at OSU. The Oregonian/OregonLive is not naming her because she claims to be the victim of sexual assault. 
 
Steve Clark, OSU’s vice president of university relations, said Tuesday that the school generally refuted claims made by the woman in her lawsuit. 
 
“We’re not responsible for her very unfortunate sexual assault,” he said. 
 
… Continue reading story here  … 
 
… And here is a statement released by Mike Riley, now the coach at Nebraska … “Yesterday, I was made aware of a complaint filed in the State of Oregon concerning a previously unknown incident to me in October 1999.  I cannot comment on any matter in the legal process.  However, I am committed to a harassment-free culture in our football program and I am continually seeking ways to expand our student education program.  Sexual assault is a horrendous crime and has no place in our society.”

USC athletic director Pat Haden: In the “best interests of the university” not to suspend Sarkisian from coaching 
 
From ESPN … Speaking publicly for the first time since Steve Sarkisian’s erratic display at a recent school event, USC Athletic Director Pat Haden said Monday that his decision regarding the Trojans coach was “in the best interest” of the university and its players. 
 
Haden condemned Sarkisian’s behavior in a statement but ultimately decided not to suspend him. Sarkisian will coach USC in its season opener Saturday against Arkansas State. 
 
During an appearance on the “Trojans Live” radio show on ESPN Los Angeles 710, Haden said he had “thoughtful conversations” with medical professionals and staff members and that “a lot of careful thought was given” before deciding on a course of action for Sarkisian following the now-infamous incident at the school’s annual “Salute to Troy” event on Aug. 22. 
 
…  “I understand a lot of people are going to disagree with my decision — it happens all the time,” Haden told the station. “I believe the course of action we chose was really in the best interest of USC and Steve Sarkisian and maybe just as important, or more importantly, our players.” 
 
Haden said he was not involved in Sarkisian’s decision to relinquish play-calling duties to offensive coordinator Clay Helton . 
 
“Those aren’t my kind of decisions to be made,” Haden said. “They’ve been talking about it for a while. Clay has been intimately involved in play calling [during his career]. 
 
“He’s a very innovative coach. I think we’ll be balanced, which I like. And I think it gives Steve a chance to do a lot more. … I think it’s great for Clay, and I really think it’s good for Steve, too.”

Star UCLA defensive back arrested, held on $100,000 bond 
 
From CBS LA … UCLA defensive back Ishmael Adams has been arrested on suspicion of robbery on campus, school officials said Monday. 
 
Adams was taken into custody by UCLA police shortly after 3:30 a.m. Sunday for allegedly using force to take a cell phone from an Uber driver, according to UCLA spokesman Tod Tamberg. 
 
The Daily Bruin reported Adams allegedly tried to take the cell phone outside of UCPD headquarters on campus. 
 
He was being held on $100,000 bail following his arrest, Tamberg said. 
 
Starting all 26 games for the Bruins over the past two seasons, Adams led UCLA with four interceptions in 2013 and returned two intercepted passes for touchdowns in 2014, tying the school record. 
 
He also scored a touchdown on a 100-yard kickoff return against Arizona State.

Washington to keep name of starting quarterback a secret for opener against Boise State 
 
From ESPN … Washington has found its starting quarterback, but coach Chris Petersen said the Huskies will keep that information under wraps until Friday’s season opener at No. 23 Boise State. 
 
“Because it’s so late, we think [keeping it private] helps us a whole lot,” Petersen said. 
 
“Our guys know what’s going on and that’s the important thing,” Petersen said. “We’re five days before the game, [naming a starter] doesn’t help us a whole lot.” 
 
True freshman Jake Browning, redshirt junior Jeff Lindquist and redshirt freshman K.J. Carta-Samuels have been in competition for the job since January when Browning enrolled early. Browning, who threw for 16,775 yards and 229 touchdowns during a record-setting career at Folsom (Calif.) High, has received strong reviews and is generally considered the favorite to win the job. 
 
The team’s previous starter, Cyler Miles, retired from football due to a chronic hip injury. 
 
Petersen left Boise State after 13 seasons, the final eight as head coach, for the Huskies before the 2014 season. Kickoff is set for 10:15 p.m. ET on ESPN.

Report: DirecTV deal with Pac-12 a done deal 
 
From Pacific Takes … It sounds like the impasse between the Pac-12 and DirecTV will come to an end.  It was reported that DirecTV was testing the Pac-12 Network on Channel 612 , which was usually the precursor to the channel becoming available on a satellite or cable carrier. DirecTV will make a deal that should come into play in time for the start or near the start of the 2015 college football season.  BruinReport has learned this through their sources . 
 
DirecTV is the last major carrier that the Pac-12 has wanted to get on board, their proverbial white whale so to speak.  DISH signed up years ago ,  Comcast, Time Warner, Bright House and Cox were the first to get on board, AT&T also recently joined up, and plenty of local cable carriers on the West Coast also have the conference channel. But DirecTV makes the Pac-12 Network a true national network, like with the SEC and Big Ten Network. It should ensure long term visibility and give the conference coast-to-coast viewing ability for any sports fan. Because NFL Sunday Ticket is exclusively carried by DirecTV, it remains the best option for all sports fans across the country. Now the Pac-12 doesn’t have to worry about that anymore.

Former Eastern Washington quarterback Vernon Adams named starter at Oregon 
 
From the Oregonian …  It took Vernon Adams Jr. two months to pass one final math class before he could complete his transfer from Eastern Washington and enroll at Oregon. 
 
Once he got on campus, however, acing the Ducks’ quarterback test took just two weeks. 
 
Oregon’s first depth chart of the 2015 college football season, released Friday afternoon, listed Adams as the starter and Jeff Lockie his backup for the Sept. 5 season opener against Eastern Washington — his former team. 
 
The race to replace Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Marcus Mariota came down to Adams, the dynamic playmaker who accounted for 121 touchdowns in three seasons as Eastern Washington’s starter at the Football Championship Subdivision, and Lockie, the career backup who even Adams acknowledged knows the UO playbook better than anyone. 
 
Yet Adams appears to have won the job decisively. Oregon typically adds an “OR” next to a player’s name on a depth chart when a competition is close, but no such distinction separates Adams and Lockie. 
 
Given Adams’ FCS-level accolades — a two-time runner-up for the Walter Payton Award, along with a stunning victory over top-25-ranked Oregon State in 2013 — Friday’s decision wasn’t unexpected. But his late arrival to camp cast doubt as to whether he’d fit into Oregon’s offense quickly enough in order to start the first game. 
 
Friday’s announcement answered that loud and clear, even if coaches and players were unavailable for comment.

Stewart Mandel from Fox Sports projects Colorado to be bowl eligible this fall 
 
While Mandel has Colorado playing in the Birmingham Bowl as a fill-in for an SEC team, it’s heady stuff to have a national columnist to actually project the Buffs to be bowl eligible. 
 
Overall, Mandel has nine Pac-12 teams being eligible for bowl bids (including all of the Pac-12 South, and excluding Oregon State, Washington, and Washington State. Counting the Rose Bowl/playoffs, the Pac-12 has seven bowl tie-ins. In Mandel’s projection, a second Pac-12 team, Arizona State, earns a Fiesta Bowl bid, with Colorado filling a vacancy when not enough SEC teams are eligible for bowl bids.

UCLA names freshman Josh Rosen starting quarterback 
 
From CBS Sports … So it seems that if your coach rips you in practice, it doesn’t mean you can’t start for him. 
 
A week after UCLA coach Jim Mora gave freshman quarterback Josh Rosen an earful in front of the media , Rosen has been named the starting quarterback for the Bruins in 2015. 
 
The decision doesn’t come as a huge surprise, as Rosen was a highly-touted recruit out of St. John Bosco in Bellflower, California. The five-star prospect was rated as the top pro-style quarterback in the 2015 recruiting class by 247Sports. 
 
Still, no matter how many stars a kid has coming out of high school, Rosen will still be a true freshman quarterback starting for a Bruins team that enters 2015 with high expectations. UCLA enters the season ranked No. 13 in the AP Poll, and No. 14 in the Coaches Poll, and has won a total of 20 games the last years. 
 
But that was with Brett Hundley running the show. 
 
It will be interesting to see if UCLA can live up to the hype while also dealing with the bumps in the road that come with playing a true freshman at the most important position on the field. That being said, it’s clear that Mora believes in Rosen, or else he wouldn’t be giving him the job.

ESPN: Sefo Liufau 8th-best quarterback in the Pac-12 
 
From ESPN … We’re ranking the Pac-12’s quarterback situations entering the 2015 season. Not all starting battles are set yet, but here’s our first stab at it: 
 
8. Colorado: Buffs coach Mike MacIntyre recently said this: “After this year is over, I think people are going to say Sefo Liufau is one of the best junior quarterbacks in America.” That statement will obviously be received with skepticism, but Liufau certainly wasn’t an absolute weakness on a bad 2014 Colorado team. He did throw 15 interceptions, but expect that number to drop if the Buffs’ defense improves and doesn’t force Liufau to play nearly constant desperation football. 
 
Teams ranked below Colorado … 9. Utah (somewhat of a surprise, considering the success Travis Wilson has had over his career); 10. UCLA (drama in the choice between freshman Josh Rosen and Jerry Neuheisel; 11. Oregon State (already announced the Beavers will alternate quarterbacks during non-conference play); and 12. Washington (uncertainty as to when a starter will even be named).

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff criticized ride-sharing software Uber on Wednesday for increasing unemployment, adding to a chorus of labor concerns about the world's most valuable venture-backed start-up. 
 
Rousseff said local authorities must regulate the service, which has led conventional taxi drivers to stage protests and lobby lawmakers in Brazil's three biggest cities. 
 
Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and the capital Brasilia have all moved to ban the mobile application, which lets users hail Uber drivers for rides. None of the bans has yet taken effect, as mayors weigh whether to approve the laws. 
 
In June, French President Francois Hollande said the low-cost UberPop service should be illegal, following violent protests by Parisian taxi drivers. Uber drivers in the United States won class action status on Tuesday for litigation demanding employee benefits. 
 
""Uber is complicated because it takes jobs away from people... It leaves taxis with less work,"" Rousseff said in response to a reporter's question on Wednesday. ""It's not an easy issue. It depends on the rules of each city and state, because it is not a federal government decision,"" she said. 
 
The San Francisco-based start-up declined to comment. 
 
In Brasilia, lawmakers have voted to ban the unregulated services of Uber, but the federal district governor vetoed the ban and set up a commission to decide what is best for the city. 
 
In Rio, the city council proposed a bill to prohibit unregulated taxi services in a move designed to ban Uber. 
 
Mayor Eduardo Paes has not yet decided whether to sign it into law, but has said he would like to develop a rival technology for the city's taxi drivers. 
 
The chilly reception for Uber contrasts with Rio's embrace of another icon of the so-called ""sharing economy."" Home-rental marketplace Airbnb Inc is an official accommodation provider for the 2016 Olympic Games next year in Rio, which has a paucity of affordable hotel options. 
 
In Brazil's largest city, Sao Paulo, a vote to ban the ride-sharing software is also awaiting a second vote from the city council and the signature of Mayor Fernando Haddad. 
 
Uber has support from Brazil's antitrust watchdog Cade, where officials see the advantages that increased competition could bring to users and advocate a negotiated co-existence between the ride-share service and city taxis. 
 
Taxi drivers complain that Uber drivers are not properly regulated and have fewer overhead costs, giving them an unfair advantage.

The internal communications solution , DeskAlerts has confirmed the roll out of version 8.0.8.27 today. The latest generation version of the service marks a major milestone with the official inclusion of the ground breaking DeskAlerts cloud service. 
 
Anton Vdovin, Project Manager at DeskAlerts said Were delighted to roll out this latest version of DeskAlerts, which is part of our regular scheduled updates. We are particularly proud of this particular issue of the system as it includes the cloud version of our corporate communications product. 

We feel that a cloud-based service is a strategic addition to DeskAlerts, giving users even more control over how and where they use the service for internal communications. It is a perfect fit for DeskAlerts and an asset along similar lines as our mobile apps. 

 
The DeksAlerts cloud solution which is debuting in version 8.0.8.27 allows existing DeskAlerts users to deploy their own version of the corporate communications software on DeskAlerts own services. The cloud version will be migrated to cloud.deskalerts.com, offering secure, convenient access from any device, on any operating system and in any geographical location. 
 
Carefully developed over a number of months, DeskAlerts Cloud has a user-friendly interface, with a premium placed on ease of set up. For users wanting to create their own DeskAlerts server in the cloud, the process is no more complex than entering their own corporate email address and hitting the log in button. If a server hasnt yet been set up, a streamlined interface does the job in a few minutes, with no technical or coding know how required. Once the server is set up, users log in as usual with their existing DeskAlerts credentials and are directed to their own corner of the cloud right away. 
 
A number of other performance improvements have also been squeezed into this scheduled August update, including a series of enhancements which have been introduced to speed up the service itself. These include the unveiling of a new, optimized dashboard calendar and campaign area. 
 
In addition to the launch of the DeskAlerts cloud service, many existing tools and functions also benefit from performance boosts, giving an overall quicker and ever more streamlined experience. 
 
Version 8.0.8.27 of DeskAlerts follows hot on the heels of another launch, that of the newest DeskAlerts iOS app.  Version 3.0 of the app went live in the  App store earlier this week with a raft of changes and improvements. Most notable of these advances was a better, more intuitive interface. Other changes included enhanced functionality and a series of fixes to make the app faster and smoother than ever. 
 
Used by businesses large and small across a growing number of industries, DeskAlerts can be accessed online, via the cloud and through the app. It makes access to a number of powerful internal communication tools easy through the web, in the office or on the move.

The Association For the Study of Songun Politics UK(ASSPUK), the Juche Idea Study Group of England(JISGE) and the UK Korean Friendship Association(UK KFA) today issued a joint statement in support of the statement of the DPRK History Society concerning the ""Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai"";
Firstly , it ill becomes the current south Korean ruler to comment on the ""Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai "" as the puppet regime established by the US suppressed those associated with the "" ""Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai"" and even went to the extreme of murdering its prime minster Kim Ku. Thus is a case of double standards by the south Korean puppet regime.
Secondly, the south Korean puppets are trying to elevate the so -called "" ""Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai "" as some kind of force for the salvation of Korea and a """"base for struggle for independence"", whereas in reality the ""Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai "" was a few bourgeois nationalists divorced and isolated from the masses. In actual fact, as the DPRK History Society  correctly points out, the Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai was heavily dependent on the reactionary Kuomintang (Chinese nationalist party ) . As the statement says "" It is a well-known fact that since its establishment in Shanghai, China in April 1919 till its disbandment in August 1945 the ""Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai"" barely kept its existence under the care of the Chiang Kai-shek-led Nationalist Party"". It is pure nonsense for the south Korean puppets to try and promote the provisional government as some kind of liberation force. This is a grave distortion of history .
We condemn the south Korean puppets for the distortion of history as well as fraudulent hypocrisy .

As of this writing, Coleen’s movie opposite Derek Ramsay has earned more than P100 million which puts her among the ranks of other box office actresses like Toni Gonzaga, Kathryn Bernardo, Angelica Panganiban and Bea Alonzo, among others. Coleen is currently busy with the second book of her afternoon top-rating soap Pasion de Amor. On top of this, Star Cinema executives also revealed that she will part of a new film come 2016 which will have her acting opposite two leading men, who are yet to be named. Due to all these things, Coleen related during the recently-concluded thanksgiving blogger’s conference of her movie, that she rarely gets to go to It’s Showtime. Of late, the noontime variety show has been spearheading the search for a partner for Angelica Jane Yap aka “Pastillas Girl.” On the show’s Thursday episode, Pastillas Girl turned emotional over the bashing that she has been getting ever since she appeared on the noontime show. “Although I went kanina, that’s the first time to experience the whole Pastillas Girl thing. And you know she seems like a genuine person. She spoke from the heart earlier. Pero she talked about how she feels about everything. Umiyak pa siya and everything,” said Coleen. To the naysayers of the segment, Coleen stressed that, “You know none of it is scripted. What I think is if you start to disregard the entire competition between the networks, you start to see that this girl is really special. She has something to offer naman to people. She deserves where she is now.” Seeing that like her, Pastillas Girl, also received a lot of judgment without really hearing her side yet, Coleen offered some advice. “Mas mahirap sa kanya kasi hindi siya artista. So parang wala pa siyang nararamdaman na good feelings about being here sa showbiz eh bina-bash na siya,” she pointed out. “Ang advice ko sa kanya eh kapit lang, kapit lang sa Diyos kasi God is really the only one who can get you through everything.” Coleen Garcia has advice for Pastillas Girl about bashers Continue to source: Push.com.ph (article and image source) or browse other latest showbiz news articles!

3089,"U.S. stocks were mixed in late afternoon trading as a slump in health care stocks offset gains for financial stocks. The market started the day higher as investors were encouraged by a report that showed the U.S. economy grew faster in the spring than previously estimated. 

Financial companies got a boost after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said that the central bank was still likely to raise interest rates this year. Nike jumped after posting strong earnings. 

KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell two points, or less than 0.01 percent, to 1,929 as of 3:13 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 83 points, or 0.5 percent, to 16,278. The Nasdaq composite dropped 50 points, or 1 percent, to 4,684. 

SPORTSWEAR SPURT: Nike soared after the company's earnings surpassed analyst expectations. Nike climbed $10.27, or 9 percent, to $125.15. 

GROWTH REVISION: The U.S. economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.9 percent in the April-June quarter, up from a previous estimate of 3.7 percent, the Commerce Department reported Friday. The strength came from gains in consumer spending, business investment and residential construction. 

RATE RISE COMING: Yellen said in a speech late Thursday that she expects the Fed to begin raising interest rates by the end of the year. She suggested global economic weakness won't be significant enough to alter the central bank's plan to raise its key short-term rate from zero by December. Record low interest rates since the 2008 global financial crisis have been a boon for stocks, underpinning a bull market that has run for six and a half years. 

THE QUOTE: ""A gradually increasing rate environment is a positive, because it sends a signal ... that the U.S. is on a good, if not great, recovery to growth,"" said Scott Keifer, global investment specialist at JPMorgan private bank. He expects economic growth to average about 2.5 percent next year, allowing the Fed to raise interest rates gradually. 

FINANCIAL BOOST: Banks and other financial companies rose as bond rates climbed. The combination of higher rates and a growing economy is good for those companies. Banks can earn more from making loans when they can charge customers more to borrow money. Citigroup rose 2.8 percent and Bank of America climbed 2.6 percent. 

EUROPE'S DAY: France's CAC 40 jumped 3.1 percent, while Germany's DAX climbed 2.8 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 gained 2.5 percent. 

VW SLUMP: Volkswagen shares fell again on Friday. The company named Matthias Mueller, the head of the group's Porsche unit, to be the new CEO on Friday. His predecessor Martin Winterkorn quit the job this week over the scandal, which has tarnished the company's reputation. VW shares ended down 2.8 percent on Friday and dropped almost 30 percent for the week. 

BONDS, CURRENCIES: U.S. government bond prices fell. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.16 percent from 2.13 percent late Thursday. The euro rose to $1.1197 while the dollar edged up to 120.73 yen. 

ASIA'S DAY: Japan's Nikkei 225 finished up 1.8 percent. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.2 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng inched up 0.4 percent. China's Shanghai Composite dropped 1.6 percent. 

METALS: Gold closed $8.20 lower at $1,145.60 an ounce. Silver edged lower, dropping 1.9 cents to $15.11 and copper fell 1.9 cents to $2.28 per pound. 

ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 79 cents to close at $45.70 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

FUTURE Australia batsman Chris Lynn has been confirmed as the new skipper of the Queensland Bulls.

Lynn will take on the captaincy for the three-week Matador BBQs one-day Cup tournament following the selection of Bulls captain Usman Khawaja to tour Bangladesh with Australia’s Test team at the same time.

News Corp revealed the Lynn captaincy news last week and how the 25-year-old is set to be the new Brisbane Heat captain in the Big Bash.

The Bulls will also welcome three debutants for the domestic one-day tournament next month.

Towering fast bowler Billy Stanlake, English-born batsman Charlie Hemphrey and South African-born Marnus Labuschagne have all been included in a Queensland Bulls one-day side for the first time.

Both Hemphrey, who scored a century for the Bulls in the last Sheffield Shield match last season, and Labuschagne made their first class debuts for Queensland in 2014-15.

Labuschagne, 21, played five Sheffield Shield games last season and has come from outside the Bulls squad after impressing during recent pre-season practice games where he scored two half centuries in three games.

The 204cm Stanlake, 20, is yet to represent Queensland at senior level but was an Australian Under-19 squad member for two seasons and attended the National Cricket Centre last year as a national performance squad scholar.

1773,"MINNEAPOLIS >> Through injuries, trades and upheaval, the Minnesota Lynx have struggled at times to find their footing this season. 

They have overcome the unfamiliar feelings of instability to land in a most familiar spot one step away from the WNBA Finals. 

Maya Moore had 20 points and eight rebounds to help the balanced Lynx advance to the Western Conference finals with a 91-80 victory over the Sparks in Game 3 of the conference semifinals Tuesday night. 

Moore was just 6 for 21 from the floor, but Seimone Augustus added 16 points and Deveraux Peters scored 12 big points off the bench to push the top-seeded Lynx into their fifth straight conference finals. They will play Phoenix, which swept Tulsa in the other semifinal. Game 1 is on Thursday night in Minnesota. 
  
“The longer this team plays, the better we’re going to get,” Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve said. 

Candace Parker had 28 points and 13 rebounds for the Sparks, who haven’t been to the conference finals since 2012. They trailed by 14 points in the first half but rallied to cut the deficit to one in the fourth quarter. 

The Lynx responded with a 9-0 run to hold off Los Angeles. 

“We were stagnant in the first half and we shot ourselves in the foot,” Parker said. “But we were able to bounce back and make it a game.” 
  
Minnesota outscored Los Angeles 22-4 in second-chance points and converted 15 turnovers into 20 points to improve to 18-2 all-time at home in the postseason, the best record in WNBA history. 

“That was the Lynx team I was hoping for in that we were aggressive in everything that we did,” Reeve said. 

Just like everything else this season for the Lynx, who won two championships in three seasons before losing to the Mercury in last year’s conference finals, nothing came easy in this series. They edged the Sparks by two points in Game 1, were beaten convincingly in Game 2 in Los Angeles and had a runaway in Game 3 get a little too close for comfort in the second half. 
  
The Lynx entered the season among the favorites to get out of the West and only bolstered those odds when they acquired Sylvia Fowles from Chicago midway through the season. But injuries to Augustus and Lindsay Whalen and Fowles’ gradual transition back to playing after sitting out in Chicago made it difficult for them to forge any kind of continuity heading into the playoffs. 

After dropping Game 2, the Lynx were in danger of a massively disappointing first-round exit entering the elimination game. 
 
 
  
Moore and Augustus struggled mightily in the early going, shooting just 2 for 13 in the first quarter. 

But the suffocating Lynx defense squeezed Parker and the Sparks. Los Angeles shot just 26.7 percent in the first quarter and turned the ball over 10 times in the first 13 minutes to fall behind by 14 points. 

“They put a lot of pressure on us and we didn’t deal with it very well,” Sparks coach Brian Agler said. 

Parker was whisper quiet in the first half, rendered ineffective by Rebekkah Brunson’s physical defensive presence. She didn’t hit a shot until 90 seconds into the second quarter and didn’t hit her second field goal until there was less than two minutes to play in the half. 
  
She came alive in the third quarter, scoring 13 points on 5-for-6 shooting to bring the Sparks roaring back. Her two free throws with just under nine minutes to go in the game cut the deficit to one, but the Lynx scored the next nine points and Parker gave them another one when she picked up a technical foul for arguing with the officials after a five-second call that gave Minnesota a 75-67 lead with 3:30 to play. 

Fowles scored nine of her 13 points in the fourth quarter and Whalen had 14 points and six rebounds. 
  
“We really came together, especially at the hardest parts of the game,” Whalen said. “That cohesion was huge for us. We needed it.”",d32075ca-82cd-4f1a-8660-5c91e67e85e4,News,2015-09-23T07:50:29Z,Inland Valley Daily Bulletin,Sparks rally falls short vs. Lynx in Game 3,0.0,News

3389,"Currency markets have reacted positively to news that Malcolm Turnbull has ousted Tony Abbott to become Australia's 29th prime minister. Currency markets have reacted positively to news that Malcolm Turnbull has ousted Tony Abbott to become Australia's 29th prime minister. The Australian dollar rose to an overnight peak of US71.52c, its highest in more than two weeks, in the wake of the Liberal Party spill late on Monday.

Shortly after Mr Turnbull announced his challenge late on Monday afternoon the currency dipped to a low of US70.63c before slowly ascending after it became increasingly clear that a change in the leadership was imminent.

The Aussie had already been on the rise late last week after better than expected local employment data, and amid a sense that the currency had been oversold during the recent markets rout sparked by turmoil in Chinese equities.

But analysts said the change in leadership could provide a much-needed boost to consumer and business confidence, which in turn is likely to support economy and ultimately the Australian dollar.

Citi analyst Josh Williamson said both the change in PM but also an expected change of Treasurer should be positive for financial markets.

""The market had lost faith in Joe Hockey following poorly received budgets and a perceived inability to 'read' the economy, in our view,"" Mr Williamson said in a note overnight.

Mr Williamson said he expected the change in prime minister to lift both business and consumer sentiment.

""We think both business and consumer sentiment readings have been adversely affected for a number of months by the lack of economic and fiscal policy direction under Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey,"" Mr Williamson said.

""Malcolm Turnbull's narrative of engaging in informed economic debate rather than catch phrases provides some hope that previously forgotten inquiries into areas that could increase economic growth, productivity and supply side reform could now receive more attention.""

Convenience store owner Vida Ofori Causey out of Worcester, Mass. was charged in federal court Monday after pleading guilty to $3.6 million worth of food stamp fraud. 
 
According to authorities, Causey abused the program between 2010 and 2014. Food stamps, officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), is run by local and federal agencies. It is overseen by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). She was able to scam the program by buying food stamp benefits from receipts for half the actual value. 
 
“Causey purchased the benefits at a discounted value of approximately fifty cents for every SNAP dollar,” a press release  from Department of Justice stated . “By so doing, Causey caused the USDA to electronically deposit into a bank account controlled by her the full face value of the SNAP benefits fraudulently obtained.” 
 
As a result, recipients had cash on hand to buy restricted items. The restricted items could include alcohol, cigarettes and even drugs. The program is supposed to be used to provide food to low-come individuals and families. In total, Causey defrauded the USDA for approximately $3,638,900.

5326,"James Madison U start-up gets seed funding for observation platform technologyBy David Schwartz
Published: September 9th, 2015 A Harrisonburg, VA-based company spun out of James Madison University (JMU) has closed a $250,000 seed round to commercialize a tethered, hovering observation platform technology. Blue Vigil’s innovation is designed to provide a low altitude vantage point while carrying a wide variety of cameras, sensors or radio equipment. The technology is mobile, lightweight and easy to use, removing the need for additional manpower or training. “Blue Vigil will offer a powerful observation and communications platform to law enforcement officials, first responders, event organizers and others,” says the start-up’s CEO Todd Stave. “The support from the Harrisonburg investment community and James Madison University is allowing us to rapidly bring this valuable technology to the markets.” InnovateTech Ventures, a Herndon, VA-based firm specializing in developing early-stage tech companies, and a small group of regional investors worked with JMU’s Office of Technology Innovation and Economic Development to identify the technology, recruiting Stave, an experienced entrepreneur, to serve as CEO. “Bringing together people to create locally based technology companies is a great example of how JMU is engaged with the community,” says university president Jonathan Alger. The university has signed an agreement with Blue Vigil to provide the start-up with office space as well as access to interns and resources for research and development. The company has committed to keeping at least half of its jobs in Harrisonburg for the next three years. “The launch of Blue Vigil through the collaboration of JMU, InnovateTech and Harrisonburg private investors is a private-public partnership enabling the commercialization of a disruptive technology in a manner which supports regional economic development goals,” says Dr. Yvonne Harris, JMU Vice Provost for Research and Scholarship. “JMU plans to continue working with these partners to develop more start-ups using this model.” Source: PR Newswire Posted under: Tech Transfer e-News",856b77ac-0569-4549-96ba-c9083a27bd23,Blog,2015-09-09T16:18:44Z,Tech Transfer Central,James Madison U start-up gets seed funding for observation platform technology,1.0,News

1922,"By RUTH WEISSMANN 
 
A week ago, the nice people at Goodyear Auto Service left me stranded in downtown Ithaca for nine hours. My “check engine” light had come on, a persistent yellow glow on my dashboard that demanded attention before I could continue my biweekly Wegmans runs. I dropped the car off (hold on, let me get the sweaty socks and granola bar wrappers out) and left on my bike, figuring — incorrectly — that it’d be an hour or so before they called me back in. 
 
After coming to terms with to the fact that I would spend my day biking around town searching for a stronger Wi-fi signal, I wound up at Barnes & Noble, my childhood mecca for all things fact and fiction. I wandered the aisles with no agenda, delighting in the idea that the employees would shelve the Kama Sutra in the “Living Your Best Life” section and stopping to flip through the cookbooks. I like to circle the store, nabbing titles that pique my interest, and I ended up by the daily planners, where it is quiet and I am left virtually alone to peruse my selections. 
 
I had picked up a book called “Good Poems,” a massive collection of the poetry read by Garrison Keillor on the radio every morning. My experience with poetry stops with the third grade state test — I don’t read too much of it, and I get upset when it doesn’t rhyme. As I skimmed through a couple of the poems, names like Thoreau and Dickinson jumped off the page. Holding the book felt so adult, so scholarly — and because ‘Scholarly Ivy Leaguer’ is my day job, I bought it. To date, I’ve read about eight of the poems. The book sits on my nightstand, glaring at me; It wants me to further my poetic education instead of rewatching Parks and Recreation for the umpteenth time. I started to wonder: Did I buy the book because I had the sudden urge to read poems, or because I wanted to be somebody that reads poetry? 
 
Spoiler: It’s the latter. I wanted to be caught examining those lengthy stanzas; to appear brainy, like someone who spends her free time turning the cogs of her brain rather than turning the radio up on her way to get Thai food. To some extent, I did enjoy the poetry. But its purchase was a thinly veiled attempt to brand myself as an intellectual. Exactly how much of what we do is an effort to become something we believe we should be? How much of our lives do we spend biting our bottom lips through things we don’t find fun in an effort to maintain an image in our own minds? I think we all strive to keep up certain appearances in the name of viewing ourselves as athletic or effortlessly popular or tolerant of a level of alcohol that in truth makes us cringe. It’s that old American ideal — fake it ’til you make it. 
 
Of course, far be it from me to decry those who own yoga pants without actually practicing yoga — it’s like wearing a cloud. But ever since that poetry book, there’s been an annoying voice in the back of my head (one that sounds eerily akin to the genie in Aladdin). Am I only part of a pre-law frat because I want to say I’m taking the bar? Do I do keep a shelf of classic novels because I want to slyly reference Hemingway in conversation? Am I nodding at cultural references I don’t understand to avoid people discovering that I grew up without cable television? 
 
I don’t mean to suggest that everything we do has an ulterior motive — quite the opposite. But I think there are small things hidden in the corners of our lives that we always wanted to be, and aren’t yet. That poetry tome, for all its quiet mocking, informed an excellent point — instead of choosing the qualities you want like candy out of a vending machine, you ought to be focusing on what you do for yourself and nobody else. In my mind, there lies happiness. 
 
People who live authentically are rare, and you can spot them a mile away. They don’t profess who they are — they don’t have to. These people are content with simple internal validation. Often they aren’t dressed the part; They do yoga without the tell-tale yoga pants. Maybe someday I will stop buying books to appear more bookish, but for now, I’m going to set a reminder every night before bed. Because I’m finishing that poetry book, one verse at a time.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT OF THE COURT
Delivered from the Bench at Ottawa, Ontario, on September 15, 2015.
[1]               In the judgment under appeal, the Federal Court declared that the change in policy applicable to women who wear the niqab, that requires them to unveil to take the oath of citizenship, was unlawful. This policy change first came into effect on December 12, 2011 and was initially enshrined in Citizenship and Immigration Canada’s [CIC’s] Operational Bulletin 359. The policy change was shortly thereafter incorporated into section 6.5 of CIC’s policy manual, CP 15:Guide to Citizenship Ceremonies.
[2]               One of the reasons given by the Federal Court for its judgment was the determination that this policy change was mandatory. The Federal Court also found that the policy change conflicted with the requirements of the Citizenship Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-29 and with the regulations made under that Act.
[3]               The appellant has conceded that if we do not interfere with the Federal Court’s finding as to the mandatory nature of the policy change, this appeal must be dismissed in part because paragraph 27(1)(h) of the Citizenship Act delegates authority to make regulations regarding the taking of the oath of citizenship to the Governor in Council and this policy change was not adopted by the Governor in Council.
[4]               While we do not necessarily agree with all the reasons given by the Federal Court, we see no basis to interfere with the Federal Court’s finding as to the mandatory nature of the impugned change in policy as this finding is overwhelmingly supported by the evidence. It follows that this appeal must be dismissed.
[5]               We decline to address the issues concerning the legality of the impugned policy change under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms as a determination on this point is unnecessary for the disposition of this case and the record before us is fairly scant as concerns the Charter challenge. Moreover, we believe that it is in the interests of justice that we not delay in issuing our decision through the examination of an unnecessary issue so as to hopefully leave open the possibility for the respondent to obtain citizenship in time to vote in the upcoming federal election.
[6]               As a result, the appeal will be dismissed with costs.

1861,"Once shunned by business and visitors as a barren streetscape, the western half of Melbourne's CBD over the past decade has been transformed. 

The ""battle of the beds"" in Melbourne is shifting in favour of hotels in the city's western precincts as weary travellers choose venues close to major transport hubs.

Once shunned by business and visitors as a barren streetscape, the western half of Melbourne's CBD over the past decade has been transformed by rapidly rising apartment towers and a dramatic shift of thousands of office workers and apartment dwellers to the Docklands.

That change is being reflected in visitor habits, STR Global data shows.

A shift in room and occupancy rates has taken place as guests are more likely to place their heads on a hotel pillow to the west of Elizabeth Street.

Analysis of all hotels in the CBD, Southbank and Docklands – divided geographically to the east and west of Elizabeth Street – shows occupancy rates in the west have climbed between 1 and 2 percentage points higher and there has been a much sharper jump in revenue per room.

Average revenue per room in hotels in the city's western end were $15 higher in 2014 than those in the east and $14 more over this year to August, STR Global data shows.

The different occupancy and revenue rates might be linked to contrasting accommodation standards at each end of the city as well as ""demand metrics"", STR Global's business development manager, Matthew Burke, said.

The city's premium five-star hotels clustered around the Paris end of Collins Street have traditionally experienced better than average visitor metrics.

CBRE's latest Australian Hotel Markets Snapshot shows Melbourne's revenue per average room (REVPAR) was up 3.8 per cent in financial year 2015.

""The short-term outlook for Melbourne is for continued room demand growth,"" it said.

Until relatively recently, most hotel accommodation was concentrated in the city's east.

Gary Stickland, general manager of the boutique Alto Hotel on Bourke, said the redevelopment of Southern Cross Station to include the SkyBus depot had put the western end of the city on travellers' radar.

Alto had an average occupancy rate of 93.1 per cent last financial year.

Major events at the Melbourne Convention Centre, Etihad Stadium and the Grand Prix in Albert Park also attracted guests wanting the convenience of proximity to venues.

""In February 2016, we are already fully booked for one weekend for the Royal [Edinburgh] Military Tattoo,"" Mr Stickland said.

""At the end of the day, people don't come to Melbourne to stay in a specific hotel . . . they come to a city or destination for a reason. They want to be close to the event that they're attending or the activity they're wanting to participate in,"" he said.

The expansion of Docklands has relocated the demographic centre of Melbourne to the west.

Mr Burke said that shift was likely to accelerate with the vast bulk of future hotel room development in the Docklands end of town.

Hoteliers and developers have moved to exploit the trend.

At least 2246 rooms are in the development pipeline in the western end of the CBD. In contrast, only 432 are expected to be built in the east, STR Global figures show.

Newer hotel stock can also attract more visitors, a factor working in the west's favour. However, it could also prove difficult for existing operators.

""It's certainly going to be a bit of a challenge,"" Mr Stickland said. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.",6a3bc1e5-7be0-4a4e-8006-c17e4a99946e,News,2015-09-22T14:15:00Z,Lakes Mail,Central Melbourne divided in battle for hotel beds,0.0,News

1536,"In the backdrop our previous Supply Chain Matters commentary related to Boeing and its decision to shortly assemble new 737 commercial jets in China, we provide another related development. In November of 2014, we called initial attention to the announcement that Boeing had initiated a multi-billion long-term supply agreement with Japan based Toray Industries for the supply of carbon fiber composite material. This ten year strategic supply agreement was initiated to provide continuity of supply of carbon fiber material needed for the production of Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner and new 777X aircraft. Apparently Boeing is now considering a supply risk strategy regarding this strategic material. Last week, The Seattle Times reported that Toray Composites America (TCA) celebrated the completion of a fifth production line at its plant near Tacoma Washington, but further warned that additional expansion will center on other U.S. east coast and overseas investments. Noted in this Seattle Times report is that each pre-preg carbon fiber assembly line requires a $100 million investment and 14 months of rigorous testing before such line is qualified to produce high specification material.  With the addition of this fifth assembly line, executives at parent Toray in Japan now indicate that any further investments will be directed at the existing TCA facility located in Spartanburg South Carolina. Toray has purchased an additional 400 acres of land with plans to build a $1 billion fully integrated composites production facility that will span precursor chemical to finished carbon fiber tape. According to the article, Toray has signed additional supply contracts with Bell Helicopters and Brazilian jet producer Embraer. A Toray executive is reported as indicating that diversifying supply in South Carolina is a desire by both Toray and Boeing to insure supply continuity, in the event of a shutdown at the Tacoma based facility. More revealing are statements by this same executive indicating that Boeing’s longer-term thinking centers on the labor cost intensity associated with manufacturing this material in the U.S. , with an eagerness to transfer some composite supply sourcing to perhaps India, which has a growing demand for new commercial aircraft, and could provide more attractive labor costs. In the lens of Supply Chain Matters, this may be an additional indication that growing demand for new commercial aircraft within specific Asian countries may include additional provisions for more supply chain presence and value-add activity.",7d468d7f-243f-4749-a9e8-949584b187da,Blog,2015-09-30T00:39:39Z,Supply Chain Matters,Boeing’s Strategic Carbon Fiber Supplier Hints of Global Supply Diversification Strategy,1.0,News
367,"About 150 families in a in this city are showing their support for local law enforcement with a painted “thin blue line” — placed on the street curb in front of their homes.

Justin Weis, a former Marine Corps police officer, is making it his mission to paint the symbol all over the city.

“I want to let officers know that, while they’re in my neck of the woods, I’ve got their backs. Should they be injured in a fire fight or if someone tries to attack them, they’ve got a safe haven in my home,” Weis told News Center 7’s Lauren Clark on Thursday.

He took to Facebook a week ago, offering to paint the symbol for anyone who expresses an interest in displaying it. The requests, he says, just keep coming.

“I’ve received them from Troy, Tipp City, Vandalia — all the way down to Springboro and Moraine as well,” Weis said. “Of course, I’m really busy here in Huber Heights at the moment but I could see moving this on to other cities and municipalities.

Weis is not asking for money.

But some people, like Ann Dew, are making donations just to keep the project going.

“We’re a house or a family unit that will support our law enforcement — it’s basically just that,” Dew said. “With everything else going on, you know, we just need to start showing our support.”

Leftover donations will be given to the Huber Heights Police Department to use as it wishes.",50bd7519-bcee-4f4b-8bda-062902c8d26c,News,2015-09-25T04:24:19Z,Dayton Daily News,Painted thin blue line show of support for police,0.0,News

3455,"The growing trouble that Iran is causing in the world today isn't an aberration. It was foretold nearly 2,600 years ago by the Hebrew prophet Daniel while he was in exile with the Israelites in ancient Babylon.
The Israelites were taken into exile in about 586 B.C. by Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar who was used by God to administer judgment against the Jewish nation for her chronic rebellion against Him and her antipathy to His laws. The Persians later succeeded the Babylonians and continued to hold the Jews captive until about 445 B.C. when Darius II issued a decree to allow them to return home.
While the Jews were still being held in Babylon under Nebuchadnezzar's son, King Belshazzar, Daniel received an allegorical vision from God concerning a distant future time when Persia would become a powerful nation that would threaten the entire world. In the vision, Daniel saw a powerful two-horned ram take on and defeat all of its challengers until a shaggy, one-horned goat arrived from a distant land to destroy it.
Here's what Daniel saw and described: ""In my vision I saw myself in the citadel of Susa in the province of Elam; in the vision I was beside the Ulai Canal. I looked up, and there before me was a ram with two horns, standing beside the canal, and the horns were long. One of the horns was longer than the other but grew up later. I watched the ram as it charged toward the west and the north and the south. No animal could stand against it, and none could rescue from its power. It did as it pleased and became great."" (Daniel 8:2-5)
The Ulai Canal was located in the ancient Persian city of Susa. Daniel recognized the geography, but he was puzzled by the symbolism of the two-horned ram.
Then, the vision continued: ""As I was thinking about this, suddenly a goat with a prominent horn between its eyes came from the west, crossing the whole earth without touching the ground. It came toward the two-horned ram I had seen standing beside the canal and charged at it in great rage. I saw it attack the ram furiously, striking the ram and shattering its two horns. The ram was powerless to stand against it; the goat knocked it to the ground and trampled on it, and none could rescue the ram from its power. The goat became very great, but at the height of its power the large horn was broken off, and in its place four prominent horns grew up toward the four winds of heaven."" (Daniel 8:5-8)
After the goat's horn was broken off, Daniel saw a small horn sprout up among the four horns that replaced the prominent horn on the goat. Here's how Daniel described it: ""Out of one of them came another horn, which started small but grew in power to the south and to the east and toward the Beautiful Land. It grew until it reached the host of the heavens, and it threw some of the starry host down to the earth and trampled on them. It set itself up to be as great as the commander of the army of the Lord; it took away the daily sacrifice from the Lord, and his sanctuary was thrown down. Because of rebellion, the Lord's people and the daily sacrifice were given over to it. It prospered in everything it did, and truth was thrown to the ground."" (Daniel 8:9-12)
Daniel was puzzled by the vision until the archangel Gabriel appeared and explained it to him: ""I am going to tell you what will happen later in the time of wrath, because the vision concerns the appointed time of the end. The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia. The shaggy goat is the king of Greece, and the large horn between its eyes is the first king. The four horns that replaced the one that was broken off represent four kingdoms that will emerge from his nation but will not have the same power."" (Daniel 8:19-22)
The fact that Gabriel appeared and interpreted the vision to Daniel means the prophecy had special significance. Gabriel is one of the Lord's most powerful angels who stands in His presence. And he brings extremely important messages from the Lord concerning major events that will take place on the earth. It was Gabriel who appeared to Mary to announce that she would give birth to the Messiah Jesus Christ. (Luke 1:26) Thus, Gabriel's visit to Daniel tells us that the vision the prophet received was vital and necessary to be recorded for future generations to study and understand.
Gabriel then finished interpreting the vision with these words: ""In the latter part of their reign, when rebels have become completely wicked, a fierce-looking king, a master of intrigue, will arise. He will become very strong, but not by his own power. He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy those who are mighty, the holy people. He will cause deceit to prosper, and he will consider himself superior. When they feel secure, he will destroy many and take his stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be destroyed, but not by human power."" (Daniel 8:23-25)
What relevance does Daniel's vision have for today? It has extreme relevance because the vision is being fulfilled in our time. Gabriel revealed that the two-horned ram represented the kings of Media and Persia. Those two ancient kingdoms were located in what is now Iraq and Iran. The ram also represents Islam while its two horns represent Shia and Sunni Islam. But who does the one-horned goat represent?
Here's where the prophecy gets interesting. The goat represents a coalition of gentile nations, with the prominent horn, according to Gabriel, representing ""the king of Greece."" We know the modern identities of Media and Persia. But Greece? Isn't modern Greece militarily weak and financially insolvent? How could that nation possibly fulfill the prophecy? It can't. The prophecy is so baffling that many biblical scholars believe that it was fulfilled in 331 B.C. when Alexander the Great invaded and conquered Persia.
But that event couldn't have fulfilled the prophecy because it wasn't the time of the end. When Alexander invaded Persia, Christ's appearance on earth was still over three centuries away. How then can we explain the prophecy? Was it flawed, or was it false? It was neither.
In order to interpret the prophecy, we have to understand that Greece was the most prominent gentile nation on earth in the ancient times. The gentiles were often referred to as Greeks and vice versa. In fact, the apostle Paul occasionally interchanged the two in his epistles. Here's an example: ""There is neither Jew nor Greek (gentile), slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus."" (Galatians 3:28)
Another relevant factor is the proximity of literal Greece to Iran. Literal Greece exists to the northwest of Iran while the nation identified as Greece by Gabriel in Daniel's vision comes from the far west to confront Media and Persia. Furthermore, Daniel witnessed the metaphorical goat come from a distant land without touching the earth. (Daniel 8:5) This indicates that Iran will be attacked either by fighter jets and or long range missiles.
But who is this nation? That nation is the United States that still possesses the most potent military and nuclear arsenal on earth. And some U.S. military officials have admitted in recent years that the only way to stop Iran from threatening the world is via a military invasion. And Iran recently became a much bigger threat to the world with the terrible deal the U.S. negotiated with the Islamic regime.
The deal lifted economic sanctions and arms embargoes against Iran, and allowed the regime to dictate the terms of inspections of its nuclear facilities.
It was a horrible deal that strengthened Iran and brought us closer to the fulfillment of Daniel's vision. Certainly, under the Obama administration, the U.S. will never launch an attack against Iran because the Obama administration loathes war. But another president in the future--perhaps the next one--will be forced to confront and destroy Iran before the Islamic regime begins launching missiles against Israel, Europe and the United States.
It's important to understand that Daniel's vision also reveals that the ""king of Greece"" will be ""broken off"" after its successful invasion of Iran. That means the U.S. is going to fall as a world superpower and be replaced by four nations. (Daniel 8:22) What nations could those be? They will likely be Russia, China, India and either France, Germany or Italy.
It's also important to understand that the Antichrist will eventually come from one of these four nations. (Daniel 8:9-12) The nation that this wicked ruler is likely to come from is Russia that's identified by both Daniel (Daniel 11) and Ezekiel (Ezekiel 38-39) as the major source of trouble for Israel and the world in the last days.
It's no secret that under President Vladimir Putin, Russia is upgrading its military and nuclear arsenal. Putin has predicted that Russia is going to become the most potent military force on earth. Despite Russia's sagging economy, Putin's administration has committed to spending $700 billion to renovate and upgrade Russia's military, nuclear arsenal, fleet of nuclear subs and ICBM technology by 2020.
But don't the Russians and the Iranians have close economic and political ties? They do. Then why would Russia sit back and allow the U.S. to invade Iran? Because Russia's relationship with Iran is mainly an economic one. The Russians need money and they sell military hardware and nuclear technology to Iran for economic purposes. The Russians will only allow the U.S. to take out the current Iranian regime if Russia is allowed to rebuild Iran and select its new government that would be controlled by Moscow.
What role will Israel play in these events? The Jewish nation is going to survive because the Islamic regime in Iran is going away. That's God's purpose in raising up the U.S. to destroy Iran. And after the U.S. falls from power, Israel will likely seek a new powerful political partner in Russia. Remember that the Antichrist will eventually defile the rebuilt Jewish Temple in Jerusalem. (Daniel 9:27, Matthew 24:15, 2 Thessalonians 2:4)
So Israel is going to play a significant role in end time world affairs leading up to the return of Jesus Christ.
But before that happens, the United States and Iran have a date with destiny, as foretold by the prophet Daniel nearly 2,600 years ago.",979d629a-8e6d-4132-909a-e472defa10cb,Blog,2015-09-01T22:53:13Z,Prophecy Review Today,"America, Iran and The End Times",1.0,News

1232,"Is your user acquisition cost too high? These are 5 mobile game marketing strategies to reduce UA cost, attract players and grow revenue organically. 

User acquisition can be a lot like that head contraption from Saw.

In the mobile game industry, paid advertising techniques on mobile devices, such as mobile ad networks, are what's typically known as user acquisition or UA.

It's the standard way to monetize mobile games.

The problem is user acquisition cost is high and rising.

And because of that, mobile game developers seem to be either closing up shop or desperately looking for ways to reduce their user acquisition cost before they have to.

The math is simple.

For a mobile game to stay profitable its user acquisition cost has to stay below its customer lifetime value (CLV).

And I'm absolutely hell-bent on helping mobile game developers reduce user acquisition cost.

That said, here are 5 actionable, mobile game marketing strategies that I want you to execute to reduce user acquisition cost, attract players and grow revenue organically...

If you're like most developers, you've got an email newsletter on your website because you know it's important, but it's also kind of a nuisance, right?

You might not have a ton of addresses so it's not super exciting to try and figure out what to send each week. And because of that, maybe you haven't sent anything in a while.

Not good.

Email is 40x better at acquiring new customers than Facebook and Twitter combined.

So here's what I want you to do...

Start investing in an 

Your offer could be an exclusive origin story, a PDF comic book or some type of in-game promo code.

In any case, it has to be something valuable enough for your audience to fork over their email addresses.

It all sounds very simple, but if you start doing this your email list will become one the best ways to grow revenue organically and reduce user acquisition cost.

Does this sound familiar? You've got an official website for your game, and it takes a lot of time and money to manage for what feels like very little return on investment.

Its primary function has really become information or PR, rather than marketing or selling games.

If that sounds familiar then you're missing a giant opportunity to generate revenue.

So, here's what I want you to do...

Convert all your official game websites into landing pages (or squeeze pages), because that's going to improve clicks through to your marketplaces.

If you're not sure how to do that please read my official game website design strategy.

Follow that guide all the way through, start growing revenue with your official game websites and start relinquishing your dependency on paid advertising.

Let's say you're a F2P mobile game with IAPs, and you're using mobile ad networks to monetize. That's the common mobile game business model.

But what inevitably happens is this...

You're going to get jealous of all the players those networks are sucking right out of your game. Your retention rate will drop and your IAP revenue will follow.

You'll be left making the vast majority of money by sending players away from your games.

User acquisition is a lot like that head contraption from Saw.

And there's a lot of mobile game developers struggling to get out of it.

Here's what helps unlock that...

Instead of relying 100% on mobile ad networks to monetize your games implement native advertising with the goal of increasing IAPs.

For example, let's say your game is Super Mario Bros 3 and a player finds a magic flute. They should see a 3-tier, native advertisement asking them which world they'd like to warp to and at what cost.

Rolling your own native advertising is one of the best ways for F2P mobile games to grow revenue and reduce user acquisition cost. 

400 million people around the world use Dropbox, the standard in cloud storage accessible from any device anywhere. But I don't want to talk about storage.

I want to talk about those 400 million users.

In the startup world, that's unbelievable. And it's a known fact Dropbox spent very little on advertising.

So, how'd they do it?

They did it with incentivized referrals.

When you sign up for a free Dropbox account you get 2 GB of storage. But if you refer it to a friend and they sign up too, Dropbox adds another 500 MB to your account.

And I want you to do the same type of thing for your games. It's called an incentivized referral program.

You've no doubt a reward system in your game. Utilize that system to leverage referrals from your players because that'll encourage organic shares, expanding your audience at a rapid pace.

Marketing channels are places online where you talk about or post content about your games, such as websites, forums, social media and email newsletters.

And every day you post new content in those channels such as screenshots, memes, trailers, video, articles, interviews and so on.

The problem is, everyone's basically getting the same information about your games wherever they go.

Nothing's exclusive.

So, here's what I want you to do…

Reserve big content reveals for only certain marketing channels.

For example, what if Twitter was the only place online where people could see new screenshots of your game? Here's what you might post in other channels to encourage followers...

Want to see our game before anyone else? Follow us on Twitter where every Saturday we post 3 exclusive, never-before-seen screenshots of [game]!

This strategy immediately does three things:

It increases your social audience because people have an incentive (1). It increases the value of your content because it's exclusive (2). And it increases total shares because your audience will want to be the person who shares it for you (3).

Content exclusivity is a powerful strategy for building an audience and reducing user acquisition cost.

User acquisition, or paid advertising techniques on mobile devices, isn't the only way to sell mobile games.

Don't buy into the lie, literally or figuratively.

There are dozens of ways to reduce user acquisition cost. And when you start taking into account your specific game's experience, there's exponentially more.

IAAX will lease five Airbus A320-200s aircraft for a period of 12 months and pay US$350,000 per month to AACL. 

IAAX will be paying a similar rate as the previous lessee, Indonesia AirAsia (IAA), and in total AACL will receive US$21 million from this leasing exercise.

5890,"Howdy all, Gonna forgo my regular chapter this week for a couple reasons. First and foremost, I have been working on Riders & Kickers. Four proofs on this thing. I got The Green and Lynch's Boys in two goes. Riders & Kickers is half the size of those and for some reason, has taken more work to get done. I can't decide if I am more picky or if I am simply distracted. It's been a hell of a year, most of which has gone by in dreamlike and often painful blur. Anyways, I kicked the third proof copy back this week, so keep your fingers crossed. The other thing is that I am having to read over the chapters that will comprise the next, and final, book. Yes, we are coming up on the end of the trail. I've got to end this somewhere, and I want to make sure everything's tied up all nice and neat before I'm done. So like the other books before it, I have to re-read it to make sure it pans out right. We have a little ways to go...a couple more miles.  The idea of finishing makes me as sad as it does happy. I've been doing this so long, I'm a little scared to stop. Between re-reading Riders & Kickers until I want to puke, and sitting down and reading chapters 200+ as if I were just a reader, I can't write. Too much going on in my head. Fortunately, I'm almost done reading. I think I'll be back on track next week. But I don't want to rush it. Gotta do it right. I really do feel like I am  riding tired through the purple dusk with a warm, yellow light shining through the trees ahead of me. A few more fresh horses, and we'll be home.

3086,"_ BERKELEY -- A medical marijuana dispensary operator has sued the city and three other dispensaries in federal and state court, alleging the defendants created an illegal monopoly that shut out competitors and drove up costs for patients.

In the federal suit filed earlier this month in U.S. District Court, Chris Smith, principal in Forty Acres Medical Marijuana Growers Collective, also accuses the defendants of racketeering, in asking the court to put an end to the city's ""flagrantly unlawful actions to establish and enable the unlawful monopolization of the sale of medical marijuana in Berkeley by a few individuals operating in blatant violation of California law."" 

Smith also alleges that the other three dispensaries violated what was California's prohibition on for-profit medical marijuana organizations.

The three dispensaries cited in the suits are Berkeley Patients Group; Berkeley Patients Care Collective; and Cannabis Buyers Club of Berkeley. Also cited as co-defendants are the Berkeley City Council and the city's Medical Cannabis Commission.

City Attorney Zach Cowan, without elaborating, said in an email, ""All (the suits) are without merits, and we will be moving to dismiss them all.""

A call to Cannabis Buyers Club was referred to another person, who said ""no comment."" A call to Berkeley Patients Group was referred to the marketing director, who did not return a voice-mail message. A person posted outside Berkeley Patients Care's premises suggested contacting the management by phone, but a voice-mail message was not returned.Advertisement Forty Acres had operated for several years at 1820-1828 San Pablo Ave. until the city ordered it shut earlier this year after declaring it a public nuisance. Several years earlier, the city had ordered Forty Acres to cease operations because the city already had the maximum number of dispensaries, three, allowed under city rules at the time.

The citywide cap on dispensaries has since been raised to four, and on Tuesday the City Council will receive a report on the selection process and conduct a review.

Forty Acres was one of the applicants earlier in the current selection process but was rejected, according to a city staff report.

Meanwhile, Forty Acres had reopened on Ashby Avenue, but as of Friday it was not open for business, the result, Smith said, of a preliminary injunction obtained by the city.

""I don't know why they put so much effort into closing a club if they call themselves a sanctuary city for medical cannabis,"" Smith said.

He said Forty Acres is ""being targeted for cultural differences,"" a theme also raised by defenders of Forty Acres in January, when the City Council ordered the San Pablo Avenue venue shut down, voting 7-2, with Councilmen Max Anderson and Kriss Worthington dissenting.

Several detractors had told the council they found Forty Acres' clientele intimidating, while supporters noted that Forty Acres' clients are mostly black, and the neighborhood is undergoing gentrification.

1705,"It’s funny – you would think we spent the entire summer in our backyard, but we actually avoided the deck and grass at all costs through the months of June, July, August, and most of September.  It was TOO HOT.  But now that it’s cooling off, we’re actually getting back outside as a family.  Hoorah! 
 

 
Speaking of being outside… 
 

 
I made Candy Cane Lane iced tea this weekend, and it was THE BOMB. 
 
  
 
Anyway… We did a major backyard renovation when we moved into our home three and a half years ago.  But here are the best part of our backyard! 
 
  
 
The Hammock 
 
  
 
The Husband gave me this hammock for my birthday (I think for #30?  Not sure – the years have started to blend together!).  I love laying in it and looking up at the trees.  It’s also a pretty good kiddo toy.  Hah. 
 

 
The Large Deck 
 
  
 
Our original deck was super small .  The design was so poor – for a decent-sized backyard, a little rectangle where you could hardly fit a few chairs just didn’t make sense. 
 

 
The first time my mom saw the house, she said, “You should expand this deck out so it touches the top of the hill.”  Kristien and I were like… “You’re a GENIUS!” So that’s exactly what we did.  I love how much room there is now for eating, lounging and playing. 
 

 
Our Sun Sails are pretty cool, too – they were only $20 each at Costco and create so much shade.  
 
  
 
The Sand Box 
 
  
 
In the back corner of the yard is our sandbox, which I got on Craiglist for $30 for Henry’s 1st birthday.  It is BY FAR his most loved and used toy.  I love the sandbox because he’ll head outside to the backyard and entertain himself forever – I love that it’s open-ended play. 
 

 
The Geodome Climber 
 
  
 
SO EXCITED about this addition!  I originally saw this product featured on a post by Janet Lansbury about Outdoor Play Spaces and knew I immediately had to buy it. I have been LUSTING for a swing set (things that parents say…) but decided that a geodome climber was much more cost and space efficient.  
 

 
We get an incredible amount of use out of this thing (BFF Nicole and I even climbed on it the other night!) and it’s so fun to watch Henry learn to navigate it.  I can tell that it will be used for many years by both kids.  And get this… it was only $200 or so! 
 

 
Things I Want to Add to the Backyard… 
 
  
 
A Mud Kitchen 
 
Rock climber grips along the side of the fence so Henry can climb along the side 
 
A tire swing 
 
  
 
A kiddie-sized picnic table

2397,"Many are yet to hit public streets Google is expanding its self-driving car fleet quickly: in the last four months the number of cars it is permitted to drive on California streets has more than tripled.

As of Monday, Google has licenses for 73 self-driving vehicles, up from 23 cars in mid May, according to records from California’s Department of Motor Vehicles. Under state law, companies wishing to test autonomous vehicle technology on public roads need a permit for each vehicle from the DMV.

All of the expansion of Google's fleet is for its latest model, a small, rounded car with a distinctive LIDAR laser imaging sensor on its roof and a top speed of 25 miles per hour.

Google has licenses for 50 of the vehicles although only a handful are currently on public roads. They can be seen driving close to the offices of Google X in Mountain View. 

A Google self-driving navigates streets near the company's headquarters in Mountain View, California, on June 29, 2015.

The remainder of Google's self-driving car fleet consists of previous generation Lexus RX450h SUVs.

These look a good deal more industrial with sensors bolted to the sides and front of the car and a similar laser imaging system on the roof.

A Google self-driving navigates streets near the company's headquarters in Mountain View, California, on June 29, 2015.

Together, the Google driverless cars were averaging about 10,000 miles per week on public roads as of early September, according to the company.

To date, Google has reported a handful of accidents and incidents involving the cars, but none have been attributed to the software. In all reported cases, accidents were either due to other drivers or happened when the car was under manual control, the company says.

With the latest Google fleet expansion, there are now 102 autonomous vehicles licensed to take to the streets in California.

The second biggest fleet after Google is Tesla's, which has 12 licensed cars and has been testing out an autonomous driving mode for use on highways. Tesla is expected to release that to owners . Mercedes Benz has 5 cars and then Volkswagen, Delphi, Bosch, Nissan and Cruise Automation each have 2 cars. BMW and Honda each have one autonomous car licensed in the state, according to the DMV.

Contributed by- Hitesh Vaidya, Practice Head (Urban Reforms), IPE Global 

The urban sector at present is going through a lot of action and upheaval. Every state and city in the country wants to hop on to the ‘Smart City’ bus. Every state is struggling intra-political and administrative battles in order to include their best horses in the “Urban Premier League”. I have never witnessed such a feeling of euphoria and fierce competitiveness amongst states and cities on discussing urban challenges and branding their best horses for undertaking this journey. 

However, surprisingly, the names which are emerging as potential candidates for this premier list are not big cities but small and medium towns. Further, a surprise factor is that erstwhile Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM ) cities are struggling to find their way into this league. 

One would have thought them as ‘low hanging fruits’, where huge infrastructure investments and reforms have already happened during the last five years and only a minimum push to introduce smart solutions was required to take them to the next level. Even the conditions laid down for participation in this race provided a clear advantage for JNNURM cities. 

The rules suggested for taking this journey towards smartness calls on cities to address two broad parameters (1) Physical Smartness: Retrofitting, Redevelopment, and Greenfield; and (2) Operational Smartness: Incorporating smart solutions for bringing operational efficiencies in cities, and responsiveness to citizens’ needs and requirements. 

Once each state has earmarked/identified their suitable candidates, the race for smartness will begin. Out of 100, only 20 will be qualified in round one to take this journey forward and the rest will be asked to prepare and again come up for the subsequent rounds. It is the first time that states and cities are competing not only in branding themselves as smart, but also in creating a unique identity for themselves. This not only represents a paradigm shift which is taking place in addressing the challenges of urban transition witnessed by India, but also sending serious policy signals to state and local governments to work in converged and coordinated frameworks for addressing the urban menace. 

However, to embark and sustain this journey is not going to be easy. Looking at the existing governance and service delivery frameworks, it is surely a daunting task and cities will require huge handholding and implementation support ranging from knowledge products, expert consultant services, hands-on training, peer-to-peer learning and knowledge sharing platforms. But the journey offers an opportunity to discard old ideas and mind-sets in changing the way we plan, implement and develop longer visionary approaches for managing cities rather than short term knee-jerk reactions, which have started haunting our governance systems at local levels.",a52e8392-e312-4bcb-912a-6685461c4d79,News,2015-09-29T12:38:35Z,EGov Online,Journey to ‘smart land': No one wants to miss the bus,0.0,Blog

New Treasurer Scott Morrison confirmed he was taking over responsibility for competition policy, along with the response to David Murray's Financial System Inquiry, given their importance to the economy.  

""I expect there will be a temptation to be pragmatic – pick up the political and economic winners and leave controversy well enough alone,"" said Allen & Overy partner Peter McDonald. 

Mr McDonald said the path for reform was always going to be treacherous, but a change of minister added extra spice. 
 
Lawyers predict that it could lead to more objective and less polarising progress, given the clear conflict of interest of having competition policy fall under the small business portfolio. But small business fears that removing competition law to the ambit of the new Treasurer could signal the government is leaning more towards the interests of big business. 

Despite hopes for progress, many corporate lawyers would rather one element be left behind: the so-called ""effects test"", one of 56 recommendations proposed by the Harper review, which would amend the current long-standing misuse of market power rules. 

Prime Minister Turnbull has assured that the effects test will be dealt with by cabinet after it was pushed as part of the new Nationals' coalition agreement. Before Mr Turnbull's successful leadership challenge, the issue had been dumped despite the protestations of former small business minister Bruce Billson who had pushed for the reform. 
Business community on edge  
With Mr Morrison indicating he was ""going to take my time on it"" the timeframe remains unclear leaving the business community on edge. 

The Productivity Commission supports the reform. If introduced, a company would need to have the ""purpose, effect or likely effect"" of substantially lessening competition to breach misuse of market power restrictions. The current provision requires proof that a company ""took advantage"" of its market power and its purpose was to damage a competitor. 

Productivity Commission chairman Peter Harris lamented this week that controversy over the reform was derailing progress on other Harper-supported recommendations that could boost the nation's productivity, income and employment. 

Those who oppose the changes include Professor Bob Baxt, an emeritus partner at Herbert Smith Freehills, who said it would not help to protect small business against bigger, more efficient competitors. 
 
""It's an absolute fallacy to think it will change the way the courts deal with their concerns,"" he said. 

""Competition law was never intended to protect small business from more efficient competitors."" 

He said misuse of market power laws should be left alone until the right case came to the High Court for determination. This could occur if the ACCC wins a bid for special leave to appeal to the High Court over its loss against Flight Centre in a price fixing case . It will also be a matter for determination by the full bench of the Federal Court in November when it will hear the  ACCC's appeal against Pfizer  for misusing its market power. 

PricewaterhouseCoopers partner Murray Deakin said the new cabinet should be very wary about introducing an effects test, which would place Australia at odds with the rest of the world. 
 
""The introduction of an effects test with such a low market power threshold is likely to constrict, not expand economic activity, which is not what this country needs,"" he said. 

Clifford Chance partner Dave Poddar said it was Australia's competition law equivalent of a ""zombie section"" that kept coming back from the dead. 

""Competition policy is a whole of economy issue and it's important that the pro-competitive reforms in the Harper Report are taken forward to unlock productivity benefits to the economy as a whole,"" Mr Poddar said.",72c7eb78-6aa8-4a9c-8581-3dcbb730f3bd,News,2015-09-24T05:12:26Z,Australian Financial Review,Lawyers cheer Treasurer taking responsibility for competition policy,0.0,Blog
349,"Prolonged sitting has been associated with adverse health effects that are only minimally neutralized by exercise, and a new study says aiming for less time spent sitting is the best way to stay healthy. In the study, thought to be the first to explore strategies to conquer what has become a serious public health concern, the research team worked with data from 38 previous intervention trials.

Sixty percent, or 23, of the trials appeared promising in relation to the remaining 39 percent, or 15.

More promising ideas included providing workers with sit-stand desks, encouraging people to keep track of how much time they spend sitting, setting personal goals for reducing sitting time and setting reminders to remind us to take a break.

All of these methods had proven themselves to be successful on their own and, what's more, none of them involve reminding people to exercise.

Other effective methods included informing people of the health benefits that could arise from spending less time sitting.

""The importance of this study is not in showing that interventions can work, but in pointing out how they might work,"" says co-author Professor Stuart Biddle of Victoria University in Australia. ""This is crucial if behavior is to be achieved more efficiently and effectively.""

After wrapping up their research, the team recommends looking at sitting time as something independent of the need to exercise more.

While they hope public health workers and policy makers will pick up on their findings, they advise individuals to start thinking this way now.

""...the findings should also be of interest to anyone looking to improve their health by reducing their own sitting time in their day-to-day lives, as many of these interventions can be adopted on an individual level,"" says co-author Dr. Benjamin Gardner of King's College London.

Published in the journal Health Psychology Review, the study supports another from earlier this year suggesting that regardless of regular exercise, prolonged sedentary periods still pose major health threats.

""Avoiding sedentary time and getting regular exercise are both important for improving your health and survival,"" said Dr. Alter, Senior Scientist, Toronto Rehab, University Health Network (UHN), and Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences. ""It is not good enough to exercise for 30 minutes a day and be sedentary for 23 and half hours.""

While the meta-analysis concluded that those with high exercise quotients experience fewer of the consequences of sitting, exercise should not be viewed as a way to cancel out these negative effects.",ec6e35e1-126d-4568-9f9b-10920d6b9650,News,2015-09-23T07:03:26Z,Times Live South Africa,Sitting less a better goal than exercising more: study,0.0,News

She overflowed with gratitude for everything Red Bird does for the seniors as well Clay County. Pansy is a young 85 year old sweetheart who beamed with pride as she showed us her quilting work. We couldn't resist her strong sales tactics, and purchased several handmade items to bring back home!
At the home of, Galin, we were able to visit with her and her grandchild. We instantly feel in love with this family. Her energy, kindness, and positive thoughts filled our hearts. This was an eye opening experience for our team to truly see how others live in such depressed/poor conditions in the U.S. Our team loved on them--knowing not to fix them; just love them. She proudly showed us the work Red Bird had done on her house and how much she loves each person involved in helping.Dinner that night, our team had clean-up duty. 3 of the team met our cook, Gail, an Appalachia resident (pictured).

You probably heard some of the amazing claims about a series of four “blood moons” and what this could mean relative to Bible prophecy. Well, number four just took place (September 27 or 28, depending on where you live) and nothing happened! That’s right. Nothing. 
 
John Hagee (author of “Four Blood Moons”) has been promoting a theory that God is sending signs in the skies that may precede the second coming of Jesus. Hagee says we are the last generation, and that God is sending signs to indicate that “…we’re going to see something dramatic happen in the Middle East involving Israel that will change the course of history in the Middle East and impact the whole world.” 
 
Well, four blood moons have come and gone and nothing happened. 
 
What is a blood moon? it is a total eclipse of the moon–a lunar eclipse, where the earth blocks the direct light of the sun from reaching the moon. The moon sits in the earth’s shadow. During a total lunar eclipse the moon appears red because indirect light from the sun passing through the earth’s atmosphere takes on a red hue and illuminates the moon. There is no blood on the moon. 
 
Blood moons are not rare at all. We get two of them every year. They often fall on Jewish holidays because of the way the Jewish calendar works. Sometimes it happens that four consecutive eclipses fall on Jewish holidays. And that’s what all the hype is about. When that happens, eclipses in the spring occur on Passover; the fall eclipses occur on the Feast of Tabernacles. That’s it. 
 
Are blood moons related to Bible prophecy. Not at all. Though that is what Hagee and others claim. Hagee says that every time four blood moons fall on Jewish holidays, something significant happens. But the historical record will not vindicate that claim. 
 
What about Bible passages that speak of “the moon being turned into blood”? Don’t those texts indicate something significant connected with the blood moons? No. The three texts ( Joel 2:28-32 , Acts 2:16-2 1 Revelation 6:12-13 ) have to do with judgments of God against sin. Those judgments took place long ago. 
 
Those texts were not about lunar eclipses, but were about the darkness associated with judgments of God. For more on this kind of highly dramatic figurative language, read Isaiah 13:1-10 and Ezekiel 32:1-11 . Those texts speak of God’s judgments on Babylon and Egypt. Those, too, have already taken place. 
 
A FINAL WORD 
 
Folks often ask me, “What about signs that tell us when Jesus is coming back?” 
 
Sorry, there are no such signs in the Bible. Jesus said this in Matthew 24:36 … 
 
“But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone.” 
 
Note that Jesus said that even He did not know. Hagee doesn’t know. John Hagee is a false teacher. You and I don’t know when Jesus will return. Just be ready.

NEW YORK 
 
It was a day full of business for Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the second day of his six-day official visit to the United States. 
 
Media moguls of the world on Friday lined up to meet Modi here, followed by a series of bilateral meetings that he had with the leading CEOs of US-based companies. 
 
The Prime Minister gave a sneak-peak into the flagship programme of his government, aptly balancing India’s interest with expectations that the US Inc may have with the country of 1.3 billion people, a market which they are keenly looking at. 
 
The Prime Minister observed that the changes in technology in media in recent times have led to an enormous democratisation of knowledge. 
 
He said the world was now technology-driven society where growth of digital infrastructure is as important as the growth of physical infrastructure. He suggested to the CEOs that India represents both the biggest opportunity and the biggest challenge for them and urged them to keep regional languages in mind as they develop their content and as they firm their investment plans for India. 
 
He also spoke of the government’s vision for Digital India, the plan to connect 6,00,000 villages through broadband connectivity and he asked the CEOs to visualise the citizens of the 21st century and think about what values they will represent and what challenges they will face. 
 
Modi also spoke of the role that digital technology could play in human resource development and further strengthening democracy and in India’s development narrative. He also gave a number of suggestions to them in terms of how media and communications companies could be part of nation’s development story. One idea that he gave was that a communication university could be setup in the country, which could then help further progress in the areas that they are really interested in. 
 
The round table meeting on media, technology and communications, the growth story for India was attended by range of CEOs including Rupert Murdoch, the Executive Chairman of Newscorp and 21st Century Fox, his son James Murdoch, CEO of 21st Century Fox, Robert Thomson, CEO, Newscorp, Uday Shankar, CEO Star India, David Zaslav, President and CEO, Discovery Communications, Michael Lynton, CEO Sony Entertainment, Michael Roth, CEO Interpublic Group of Companies, Shane Smith, CEO, Vice Media, Martin Sorell, CEO, WPP, Jeff Bewkes, CEO, Time Warner, Nancy Dubuc, CEO, A+E Networks, Anthony Pratt, Chairman, Visy Industries, William Duhamel, Route One Investment Company and Jeff Ubben, CEO ValueAct Capital. 
 
As James Murdoch himself summed it up, 40 per cent of the world’s entertainment industry was present in that room and this was a combination of executives dealing with media and entertainment and also executives who are venture capitalist and investors in media related companies. 
 
After finishing the meeting with media honchos, Prime Minister had a series of bilateral meetings with the leading CEOs of US based companies. 
 
External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Vikas Swarup said in a media briefing that 42 of the world’s leading CEOs of Fortune 500 companies were together in that one room. “I was told that the net worth of all the companies put together is USD 4.5 trillion,” he said.",5a3e6c7a-562f-4524-aad5-b2972373a337,News,2015-09-25T20:20:13Z,Navhind Times,Modi hardsells India dream to America Inc,0.0,News

Net loss[2] was RMB598.1 million ( US$96.5 million ) and loss per ordinary share and per American depositary share (""ADS"") was RMB3.29  (US$0.53) . On an adjusted non-GAAP[3] basis, net loss was RMB596.9 million ( US$96.3 million ) and loss per ordinary share and per ADS was RMB3.28  (US$0.53) .

""During the second quarter of 2015, our shipments to China and the U.S. grew significantly and increased by 110% and 35%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2015. Due to our continuous efforts in market diversification, our shipments to emerging markets, such as Northern and Southern Africa , Central and Southern Asia , Middle East and Latin America , continued to make remarkable progresses."" 
 
""We successfully repaid the RMB1.2 billion three-year unsecured medium-term notes due in May 2015 , and we are actively taking measures to prepare for repayment of the RMB1.0 billion five-year unsecured medium-term notes when they become due this October and are exploring a number of financing options including liquidation of idle assets, introduction of strategic investors and potential new cooperation model with our business partners. Also, for our downstream project development business, we have adopted and will follow a core principle of 'less investment, and quicker turnover' in order to maintain a stable cash flow. We believe these measures will help us to enhance our cash position, and allow us to gradually improve our balance sheet."" Mr. Miao concluded. 
 
Second Quarter 2015 Financial Results 
 
Total Net Revenues 
 
Total net revenues were RMB2,716.1 million ( US$438.1 million ) in the second quarter of 2015, compared to RMB2,905.8 million in the first quarter of 2015 and RMB3,408.9 million in the second quarter of 2014. Total PV module shipments (including 43.2MW shipments for PV systems of the Company's own downstream PV projects) were 727.9MW in the second quarter of 2015, compared to 754.2MW in the first quarter of 2015 and 887.9MW in the second quarter of 2014. Revenues were not recognized for 43.2MW of internal shipments as required by U.S. GAAP. 
 
The decrease in total net revenues in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2015 was mainly due to a decrease of PV module shipments in the second quarter of 2015 and decline in the average selling price of PV modules, which was primarily due to higher proportion of our shipment to China market and the depreciation of Euro and Japanese Yen against Renminbi in the quarter. 
 
Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 
Gross profit was RMB171.0 million ( US$27.6 million ) in the second quarter of 2015, compared to RMB410.8 million in the first quarter of 2015 and RMB532.1 million in the second quarter of 2014. 
 
Gross margin was 6.3% in the second quarter of 2015, compared to 14.1% in the first quarter of 2015 and 15.6% in the second quarter of 2014. The decrease in gross profit and gross margin from the first quarter of 2015 to the second quarter of 2015 was mainly due to the decline in average selling price of PV modu les a nd the increase in unit manufacturing cost as a result of a lower utilization rate of production facilities in the second quarter of 2015. Gross margin on sales of PV modules was 7.9% in the second quarter of 2015. 
 
Operating Expenses 
 
Operating expenses decreased to RMB349.3 million ( US$56.3 million ) in the second quarter of 2015 from RMB477.2 million in the first quarter of 2015, and compared to RMB618.1 million in the second quarter of 2014. The decrease in operating expenses from the first quarter of 2015 to the second quarter of 2015 was mainly due to the recognition of a gain from disposal of the land use rights held by Fine Silicon, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Yingli Green Energy. 
 
Operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues were 12.9 % in the second quarter of 2015, reduced from 16.4% in the first quarter of 2015 and 18.1% in the second quarter of 2014. 
 
Operating Loss and Margin 
 
Operating loss was RMB178.3 million ( US$28.8 million ) in the second quarter of 2015, compared to operating loss of RMB66.4 million in the first quarter of 2015 and operating loss of RMB85.9 million in the second quarter of 2014. 
 
Operating margin was negative 6.6% in the second quarter of 2015, compared to negative 2.3% in the first quarter of 2015 and negative 2.5% in the second quarter of 2014. 
 
EBITDA

For the R MB 1.0 billion five-year unsecured medium-term notes du e in October 2015, the Company is exploring various measures for the repayment of these notes . The C ompany is also working on a number of financing options to continue to manage the Company's liquidity and to enhance its financial flexibility. 
 
Downstream Development in 2015 
 
In China , the Company began the construction of 78 MW of PV projects and connected 94 MW of PV projects to the grid in the second quarter 2015. As of June 30, 2015 , the Company had a total of over 400 MW of PV projects under construction across a dozen provinces in China . 
 
In July, the Company was selected to develop and construct a 50 MW PV project in Shanxi Province , China , which will be one of the key demonstration projects of National Energy Administration's ""Top Runner"" program. 
 
In consideration of China's nationwide delay in subsidy allocation, long-term operation of large ground-mounted PV stations would require significant capital. Accordingly, the Company has adopted a more prudent approach to downstream project development business and is in active negotiations with certain leading corporations about potential sale of the PV projects developed by the Company. The Company has approximately 100MW of PV projects sold or close to sale to those parties. 
 
Expected Non-Cash Impairment Charge on Long Lived Assets in Third Quarter and Fiscal Year 2015 
 
As a result of the lower-than-expected utilization of certain production facilities of the Company in the second quarter of 2015 and the expected continuation of such utilization in the remaining quarters of 2015, the Company has concluded that impairment triggering events have become apparent in the third quarter of 2015 and has begun the process of performing its long-lived asset impairment analysis with respect to those production facilities. While the impairment analysis has not been completed yet, the Company expects to recognize a significant amount of non-cash impairment charge on those production facilities in the third quarter of 2015, which will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial results for the third quarter of 2015 and fiscal year 2015. 
 
Business Outlook for Third Quarter and Fiscal Year 2015 
 
Third Quarter of 2015 
 
Based on current market conditions, the Company's current operating conditions, estimated production capacity and forecasted customer demand, the Company expects its PV module shipments to be in the estimated range of 550 MW to 580 MW for the quarter ending September 30, 2015 . 
 
Fiscal Year 2015 
 
Based on current market conditions, the Company's current operating conditions, estimated production capacity and forecasted customer demand, the Company expects its total PV module shipments to be 2.5 GW to 2.8 GW for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015 . 
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
To supplement the financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating loss, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per ordinary share and per ADS and EBITDA, each of which (other than EBITDA) is adjusted to exclude, as applicable, items related to share-based compensation, interest expense related to the changes in the fair value of the interest-rate swap and the amortization of the debt discount, the amortization of intangible assets, inventory provision and non-cash provision for inventory purchase commitments. EBITDA excludes interest, tax expenses, depreciation and amortization. The Company believes excluding these items from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful for its management and investors to assess and analyze the Company's on-going performance as such items are not directly attributable to the underlying performance of the Company's business operations and/or do not impact its cash earnings. The Company also believes these non-GAAP financial measures are important to help investors understand the Company's current financial performance and future prospects and compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see the financial information included elsewhere in this press release. 
 
Currency Conversion 
 
Solely for the convenience of readers, certain Renminbi amounts have been translated into U.S. dollar amounts at the rate of RMB6.2000 to US$1.00 , the noon buying rate in New York for cable transfers of Renminbi per U.S. dollar as set forth in the H.10 weekly statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board as of June 30, 2015 . No representation is intended to imply that these translated Renminbi amounts could have been, or could be, converted, realized or settled into U.S. dollar amounts at such rate, or at any other rate. The percentages stated in this press release are calculated based on Renminbi amounts.

2355,"Wales head coach Warren Gatland has made three injury-enforced changes for Thursday's World Cup Pool A clash against Fiji in Cardiff. 
 
Bristol full-back Matthew Morgan replaces Liam Williams, who is recovering from concussion, while centre Tyler Morgan replaces knee injury victim Scott Williams and wing Alex Cuthbert takes over from Hallam Amos, who is sidelined from the rest of the tournament with a shoulder problem. 
 
It is otherwise the same team that beat England at Twickenham three days ago, with James Hook, who was called into the squad as a replacement on Monday, named among the replacements.

Gatland retains the pack on duty against England, with flanker Dan Lydiate and number eight Taulupe Faletau both winning their 50th caps. 
 
Matthew Morgan, 23, and 20-year-old Tyler Morgan make their first World Cup starts as Wales look to take another major step towards the quarter-finals, with Gatland's selection reflecting the huge importance of Thursday's game. 
 
Tyler Morgan missed out on original World Cup selection but was then drafted in as a replacement for Cory Allen, who suffered a tournament-ending hamstring injury after scoring three tries against opening opponents Uruguay. 
 Must keep up momentum  
Victory for Wales would put them within touching distance of the last-eight, and also leave England having to beat Australia at Twickenham on Saturday or the host nation will suffer an embarrassing pool stage exit. 
 
""It is important we build on the success and momentum from last weekend and take that into Thursday,"" Gatland said. 
 
""Fiji have performed very well in their opening two games, and they will be coming to Cardiff looking to build on that themselves. 
 
""We have made three changes through injury, but go into this game with a strong side. 
  
""We are looking forward to being back at the Millennium Stadium on Thursday and having the crowd right behind us in an important World Cup fixture."" 
  

 Injury woes  
Apart from beating Fiji, Wales will also hope they can emerge unscathed in terms of injuries, with Australia looming at Twickenham nine days later. 
 
Gatland has so far lost almost a sixth of his original 31-man World Cup squad through injury - a casualty count comfortably higher than any other team - with Amos and Scott Williams following Allen, full-back Leigh Halfpenny and scrum-half Rhys Webb in being sidelined from the tournament. 
 
Hook apart, the bench is unchanged from that on duty at Twickenham last Saturday, with again no place in the match-day 23 for Ospreys prop Paul James, who went off with calf muscle trouble during the Uruguay game.

 Air Freight   
   
 
Changi Airport Group (CAG) welcomes AirBridgeCargo Airlines (ABC) to Singapore Changi Airport, with its inaugural flight from Moscow, Russia, scheduled to arrive tonight. The international freighter carrier, which is part of Russia-based Volga-Dnepr Group, is launching twice-weekly Moscow-Singapore-Hong Kong-Moscow services with a Boeing 747-8F aircraft. ABC’s new services to Singapore establish Moscow as a new freighter city link for Changi Airport, and strengthen Changi Airport’s connectivity to Russia and beyond. 
 
The new dedicated cargo services to Singapore will facilitate the movement of cross-border shipments and enhance the country’s product offerings for its customers in Asia. With the addition of Singapore, which is ABC’s ninth online station in Asia, the airline will now provide over 500 weekly delivery solutions from the region, all with a delivery time of below 48 hours including handling procedures. The airline already has a diverse business portfolio in the region, connecting clients in China, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam with its cargo gateways in Europe, the USA and Russia. 
 
Robert van de Weg, ABC’s Senior Vice President, Sales & Marketing, said: “The ABC team is pleased to start connecting customers in Europe, the USA and Singapore with dedicated freighter services to Changi Airport. With the addition of this route, ABC is continuing its strategy to provide customers with better access to point-to-point deliveries within its global route network, while providing them with on-time, reliable and high quality service levels. Singapore, via ABC’s Moscow hub, will be directly connected to gateways like Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Milan without trucking. Asia is a vitally important market for ABC and we look forward to further growth in this dynamic region.” 
 
CAG’s Assistant Vice President for Cargo & Logistics Development, James Fong, added: “This new service by ABC marks a significant milestone for Changi Airport as it opens up new cargo opportunities between Singapore and Russia. Logistics players, who were previously limited by capacity constraints between Singapore and Russia, now have a direct option to transport large freight shipments as well as general cargo between the two countries. The enhanced air connectivity will foster further trade between both countries which is already growing steadily.” 
 
Changi Airport is one of the world’s busiest cargo hubs. In the first half of 2015, cargo throughput at Changi Airport reached 912,300 tonnes. During this period, 1,034 tonnes of cargo was handled between Singapore and Russia. Between 2010 and 2014, air cargo volumes between Singapore and Russia grew by an average growth rate of 16% annually.

4931,"It's not as complicated as you think. 
Yesterday we saw the photo of Arsene Wenger flying to Paris, and it could have meant one of two things.

One, he was going back to France to chill out while the international break played itself out while providing TV commentary during France's matches. Or it could have meant that, but also to pry away a few assets from the capital city's biggest club.

According to the London Evening Standard, Wenger flew in to Paris yesterday to initiate talks for striker Edinson Cavani and holding midfielder Adrien Rabiot. Apparently, according to this article, Wenger wants to give Francis Coquelin a chance to hold down that spot but recognizes the options behind Le Coq are Mathieu Flamini and a severely broken-down Mikel Arteta. Netting Rabiot would give him an extremely-promising, long-targeted player of theirs, while Cavani would fulfill his desire to only upgrade at striker if a world-class option was available.

However, PSG hasn't shown an apparent willingness to sell either player, but offered Zlatan up to Arsenal as an alternative.

Deveron - The Last Great Malt
John Dewars & Sons, the owners of the Macduff distillery in northern Aberdeenshire, have announced that the first ever range of single malts from the distillery are to be released this October.  These will be bottled as The Deveron, the name of the river while runs next to Macduff and then out in to the North sea.  The new range will feature expressions of 10, 12 and 18 years of age with all bottled at 40% ABV.  The price of the 10 years old is still to be confirmed but the 12 years old will be £39 and the 18 years old £79.
The Macduff distillery is relatively modern and was founded in 1962.  The Deveron 10 years old will be exclusive to France with the 12 and 18 years old being available in selected world markets including Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, Sweden, Taiwan, the UK and the USA. The range is the last to be released in Dewars' series called The Last Great Malts.  This has seen whiskies released from their five Scottish distilleries.
Glenfiddich - Gets a reboot
The world's best selling single malt has announced that it will be releasing new packaging for the remainder of its core range.  The new bottle design and presentation tube for the Glenfiddich 12 and 15 years old expressions will appear in retailers worldwide from mid-September.  This joins the 18 years old Small Batch single malt, which appeared on the market back in November last year.  The bottle and packaging feature a more prominent and evolved stag logo, gold trim, bolder type and a cream band around the base.
Sarah Harding, the Senior Brand Manager for Glenfiddich, commented: “We are thrilled with the refreshed core range. Glenfiddich is a superior whisky, so naturally we want its presentation to match the quality of the award winning liquid. The prestigious new look will hopefully capture and reflect our whisky making credentials and the brand’s authenticity and family heritage.” Gordon & MacPhail - Generations in the making
One of Scotland's largest and leading independent whisky bottlers has unveiled its oldest and most unique single malt to date - the Mortlach 75 years old.  The bottling is the latest in Gordon & MacPhail's Generations series, which has seen them showcase some of their oldest casks. Third and fourth generations of the Urquhart family, the owners of Gordon & MacPhail joined distinguished guests at the launch held at The Royal Opera House in London.
The whisky was distilled at the Mortlach distillery in Speyside and then laid down to mature in a first-fill ex-sherry cask in November 1939.  It has been under the careful watch of Gordon & MacPhail ever since and has been bottled at the natural cask strength of 44.4% ABV after 75 years.  There are just 100 bottles available and these will be priced at £20,000 each.
The Mortlach 75 years old Generations comes presented in a bespoke crystal decanter featuring 75 cuts to represent each year of maturation, a presentation plinth and two crystal glasses.  This sits in an Aniline leather bag, which includes a special book written by Charles Maclean and Alexander McCall Smith.
Royal Brackla - The Last but one Great Malt
John Dewar & Sons have announced a range of single malts from its Royal Brackla distillery in Speyside.  The distillery was founded in 1812 and was the first Scotch whisky distillery to receive a Royal Warrant (by William IV in 1835).  The new range forms part of Dewars' larger range called The Last Great Malts, which showcases whisky from each of their five distilleries.  Ranges from Aberfeldy, Aultmore and Craigellachie are already on the market with Macduff (bottled under the Deveron name) to follow this Autumn (see above).
The Royal Brackla range features expressions of 12, 16 and 21 years of age.  They will be priced at £46, £85 and £175 respectively.  All are bottled at 40% and will be available from mid-September in 10 worldwide markets - Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, Sweden, Taiwan, the UK and the USA, plus Global Travel Retail. Stephen Marshall, Global Marketing Manager for The Last Great Malts, said: “This was described as ‘The Drink Divine’ by the Royal household in the 1830s, so we had to take our time and the entire team have done an amazing job that really does justice to Royal Brackla’s incredible heritage. There’s only one whisky in the world that can be the first Royal whisky and I feel privileged to have worked on this”.  Speyside - Back in black
The Speyside distillery near Kingussie in the Cairngorm mountains has launched a new 'black whisky' named Beinn Dubh.  This translates as 'black mountain' from Gaelic and refers to the mountain Ben Macdui, which is the highest in the Cairngorms and also known as Beinn Dubh by locals.  The whisky has been finished in toasted ex-Port casks from the Douro Valley in Portugal and this is what is said to give the very dark colour.  It was launched at the Thunder In The Glens, Europe's largest Harley Davidson festival, in Aviemore earlier this week.  Beinn Dubh is bottled at 43% ABV and has a recommended price of £50 a bottle. Patricia Dillon, the Managing Director for Speyside Distillers Ltd, said: ""Like the mountain, the whisky is dark and mysterious. It is very much the whisky of the Cairngorms – the water used in its production is from the Black Mountain itself, and the malted barley is sourced locally. We are passionate about the Cairngorms and they are very much part of the distillery’s story.""

NEW YORK 
 
Microsoft has given longtime executive Brad Smith the title of president, as the company continues its transition to a new generation of leadership. 
Smith’s full title will be president and chief legal officer. He has been Microsoft’s general counsel since 2002 and became an executive vice president in 2011.CEO Satya Nadella announced the appointment in an email to employees. Nadella said he wants Smith to play a bigger role in strengthening Microsoft’s relationships and representing the company publicly. Smith will help lead the company on issues like privacy, security and accessibility, he said. Smith, 56, joined Microsoft in 1993 and has held several other titles, including company secretary. 
Smith is a familiar face for investors because he has been a regular presence on the company’s investor conference calls for almost a decade, said industry analyst Katherine Egbert of Piper Jaffray. “It is interesting that they would put him as president of the company because he doesn’t come from the operational side,” she said. “I think it’s a promotion of someone who’s been a solid executive for them for a long time.” 
Shares of Microsoft Corp. rose 19 cents to $43.48 on Friday. The stock is down 7.5 percent over the last year.

2501,"An Australia Post worker who was shot dead after lunging at police with a knife on the NSW Central Coast was not sacked from his job on the day of the shooting, but had left work because he was feeling unwell, according to union officials. 

Warning: some people may find the attached video distressing

﻿ 

Steve Hodge, a long-term Australia Post employee who had a history of mental health issues, on Wednesday afternoon in a tense confrontation with police that a witness recorded on a mobile phone camera.

The footage, taken about 3.15pm, shows police repeatedly pleading with Mr Hodge to drop the large knife he was carrying.

""C'mon mate. You don't want to do this ... Put it on the ground or we'll shoot,"" one officer can he heard saying, before Mr Hodge advanced on one of the officers with his knife raised.

Three shots rang out and Mr Hodge fell to the ground. He died at the scene.

It has been reported that Mr Hodge was sacked from his job on the day of the shooting, before returning to the post office that afternoon with the knife.

However, the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union (CEPU), which represents postal workers, said Mr Hodge, a union employee, had not been terminated from his job.

Instead, Mr Hodge had gone home from work that day ""because he was unwell"", a union spokesman said.

An Australia Post spokesman said the organisation was providing counselling and support to staff following Mr Hodge's death.

""We are saddened by the loss of a valued, long-term team member and our thoughts are with his family and colleagues,"" the spokesman said.

""We will do everything we can to provide them with support at this difficult time, and we are providing counselling services to our staff and customers.

""Nothing is more important to Australia Post than the safety of our people and we will work with relevant authorities to thoroughly investigate all aspects of this tragic event.""

CEPU branch secretary Jim Metcher said that Mr Hodge was ""always held in high regard and supported by his colleagues"".

""Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends along with our local retail members who have been subjected to this horrific ordeal,"" Mr Metcher said.

1887,"Reading take on Everton this evening (8pm kick-off) for only the 11th time in their long history. 

The Merseyside club have shaded the previous meetings, winning six while Royals have emerged victorious on three occasions. 

There has been one draw, a 1-1 stalemate at Goodison Park in 2007 which will always be remembered for Sylvester Stallone’s half-time appearance on the pitch. 

But as well as looking at previous meetings between the sides, we thought we would take a look at how Steve Clarke has fared against the Toffees since hanging up his boots. 

We’ve gone back to when he arrived at Newcastle in 1998 alongside Ruud Gullit. Then we’ve looked as the statistics from his time as assistant manager at Chelsea, West Ham and Liverpool, as well as his stint in charge at West Brom. 
Related:  An expert view on Everton   Newcastle: Played 4 - Won 1, Lost 2, Drew 1 
In his first season at St James’ Park, Clarke suffered home and away defeats against Everton during the 1998/99 campaign. 

Things improved the following year, however, as the Magpies followed up a 1-1 stalemate with a 3-1 success in March 2000. 
Chelsea: Played 12 - Won 8, Lost 0, Drew 4 
 There were plenty of reasons to smile for Steve Clarke when Chelsea met Everton. 

As you would expect, Clarke’s time at Stamford Bridge saw him enjoy an excellent record against the Blues. 

In fact, he never lost to the Merseysiders while he was with Jose Mourinho in west London. 

They met 12 times in all competitions, with Chelsea winning eight and drawing four. 

Included in those victories was a League Cup semi-final success during the 2007/08 season. 
West Ham: Played 4 - Won 0, Lost 3, Drew 1 
Having enjoyed several seasons of dominance over Everton while at Chelsea, things changed when Clarke moved to West Ham alongside Gianfranco Zola. 

Over two campaigns from 2008 to 2010, West Ham failed to beat the Blues home or away. 

They met on four occasions, with the Toffees winning three. The only draw came in April 2010 when the sides shared a four-goal thriller. 
Liverpool: Played 4 - Won 3, Lost 0, Drew 1 
 Steve Clarke celebrates with Kenny Daglish after Liverpool beat Everton in the FA Cup semi-final. 

Clarke moved to Liverpool in January 2010 and had a good record against the Blues while on Merseyside. 

The two teams met four times, with Liverpool never losing to their neighbours. 

The Reds won three, including an FA Cup semi-final, and drew the other of their meetings. 
West Brom: Played 3 - Won 1, Lost 1, Drew 1 
This was Clarke’s first job as a head coach and he enjoyed mixed results against Everton during his spell in charge at the Hawthorns. 

He picked up one victory, a 2-0 success in September 2012, and then had a draw and a defeat in his other two games against the Blues.

766,"DYLAN Walker and Aaron Gray are expected to make a full recovery from their overdose of painkillers, amid growing calls for the NRL to address the problem of the misuse of ­prescription medicine within rugby league. The condition of the South Sydney duo has improved considerably since they were rushed to St Vincent’s hospital on Tuesday morning and they could be released by the end of the week.

After being admitted in a critical condition, Rabbitohs CEO John Lee on Wednesday said that assessment has since been updated to good.

Lee said the pair were now free of medical equipment that was supporting them after their near-death experience.

TROUBLE: Mark Geyer reveals addiction “They’ve gone from critical to stable and now I can report that their condition is even better, it’s good,” Lee said.

“Both the players are very alert. They’re communicating with medical staff and with their families.”

Lee said Gray’s situation was particularly dire.

“Their health was paramount and that’s why the medical staff at St Vincent’s acted very quickly to stabilise them,’’ he said.

“It was a very serious matter. If circumstances had been different, if there hadn’t been another person at the unit, we might have been talking about a totally different event.”

  Joe Launchbury knows Wales will still be incredibly tough to beat   
Adding to the problems facing Gatland are the concerns over props Paul James, Samson Lee and Aaron Jarvis as Wales find their playing resources being stretched to the limit. 

			 
Launchbury, however, recalls when England visited the Millennium Stadium in February while contending with a lengthy casualty list of their own yet still claimed a rousing 21-16 victory. 



 
""It's bit of role reversal because we went to Cardiff in the Six Nations with some injuries and the guys put in a great performance. The shoe is now on the other foot,"" Launchbury said. 

""Wales are coming to an away ground and have a huge opportunity to upset us in the World Cup. 

""From when Warren and Shaun Gatland were at Wasps, I know the sort of messages they will be giving to their players in the week. I am sure they are hugely excited. 

""Warren will be telling them to make a fast start and really try and use their forward pack to get a foothold in the game. 

			 
""They have some nasty injuries which is huge shame and they will miss those players, but others are coming in who are exceptionally talented with a lot of caps behind them."" 

Launchbury made an impression from the bench in Friday's 35-11 victory over Fiji and is among a number of players pushing hard for a starting place when head coach Stuart Lancaster names his team on Thursday morning. 

""What a huge challenge this will be against a really strong Welsh side. It's important that everyone keeps on pushing because this is a tournament that you are desperate to be involved in. They guys who came off the bench really made a difference against Fiji,"" Launchbury said.

Between soccer, fall ball, tutoring, swim practice and everything else, evenings can be pretty hectic, right? Planning is definitely key to balancing everything, but sometimes we just forget to plan. I know I can’t be the only one. This weeknight dinner was concocted on one such evening where I just threw what I had into a sauté pan and hoped for the best. Well, it was delicious and done in 20 minutes. 
 

 
Ingredients: 
 
2 tbsp olive oil 
1lb Sweet Italian turkey sausage (removed from casing) 
½ a yellow onion (diced) 
1 package of fresh baby kale (roughly 4 large handfuls) 
½ lb cooked pasta of your choice 
1 tbsp butter 
Salt & pepper 
 
First, get that water going for your pasta. 
 
Now heat up the olive oil in a large sauté pan. Toss in your onion and sausage. Check your pasta water, it should be about done. Get your pasta cooking! 
 
Once the sausage is browned, the onions are translucent, and your pasta is near done, toss in the kale and add some salt and pepper. Cover and turn down the heat. 
 
Add the cooked pasta and tablespoon of butter to the sausage and kale, toss and serve. So delicious and filling! Hope you enjoy!

462,"Keep your scanner tuned to this station. Robotech is back! 
 
Chapter 83: Reflex Point 
 
This is exciting! Reflex Point! The whole story has been heading towards this point for so long! My expectations are very high. 
 
The Regis muses on irony, and how protoculture allows the Invid to change into any form they like, but their extensive research has concluded that HUMANS, HUMANS ARE THE BEST DESIGN. 
 
“We are Invid, we cannot fail, I will not allow it.” 
 
 

 
A group of troublemakers, AKA our heroes, are startled by an explosion nearby. Hoping it might be that spunky Rick Hunter, they head towards it only to find some damaged mecha in a smoking crater. 
 
Scott carefully surveys the damaged mecha and pronounces that there are no survivors. 
 
“Nobody said war was pretty.” The narrator, setting the tone as always. 
 
Proving that Scott is an idiot, a survivor promptly turns up – an intelligence agent called Sue Graham, who looks a lot like Marie Crystal but isn’t. Her assignment is to record the mission for Admiral Hunter and send him information. 
 
Scott is furious to find out that Sue filmed the deaths of her colleagues instead of joining in the battle and getting killed alongside them. He and Lancer get aggressive and judgy at her. 
 
Hundreds of Invid are approaching. Sue tells them all to deactivate their protoculture cells and abandon the mecha so the Invid think everyone is dead, but they are so busy not trusting her that they leave it to the last minute and only just make it into the woods. 
 
Their Cyclones have a near miss, but the jeep and the Beta are both knocked into a ravine by the stompy Invid. Aww, ships, no. (Don’t worry, they’re fine later) 
 
Sue has some good news, at least: there is a force of Admiral Hunter’s fleet, called shadow fighters, hanging around the dark side of the moon, ready to launch an assault against the Invid when “the time is right”. Scott repeatedly challenges her about doing her job (passing information to the local fighters to give them hope, and collecting data to send back to the fleet) rather than going rogue freedom fighter like him, which is the Only Correct Moral Choice. 
 
Scott needs to not be in charge any more. 
 
#TeamSue 
 
The crew all have adorable space sleeping bags that make them look like caterpillars. Scott is angsting about Marlene Mark I, and Marlene Mark II suggests that he’s never going to be over her. She has a good point considering that he NAMED HER AFTER HIS DEAD GIRLFRIEND. 
 
Scott and the crew are reluctantly going on a mission to collect a magic special space cannon that Sue told them about. Scott suspects that Sue has set them up so she can get some amazing footage of them getting “creamed” by the Invid. 
 
I’m confused by their lack of distinction between a spy collecting necessary war intelligence, and a paparazzo-style media bunny. Mind you, Sue doesn’t help the situation by saying things like “Admiral Hunter’s going to love this footage” which implies she is creating entertainment for the poor bored Admiral instead of, you know, helping the war effort. 
 
On the other hand, maybe Rick is just super bored. It’s not easy at the top. 
 
Even the narrator complains that Sue is shooting nothing but film footage, when the Invid attack. Annie isn’t shooting anyone either! Because it’s NOT HER JOB OR HER SKILLSET. 
 
I can’t help noticing that this episode called Reflex Point does not seem to actually have anything to do with Reflex Point. Surely they’ll get there soon, right? Right? 
 
The leader of this particular Invid battalion is a glam rock style blond who bleeds green when he is killed. Sue is delighted to have proof that the Invid are turning themselves into humans – but Marlene is less than delighted, because she is bleeding green from a scratch on her arm. 
 
YOU GUYS I THINK MARLENE IS AN INVID! 
 
Marlene flees in horror, and Scott is surprisingly calm and forgiving about the whole thing, thinking more about how upset she must be than worrying about whether she was spying on them. It’s his one moment of being pretty awesome in an episode that is mostly all about him being a dick. 
 
Sue drops dead from, I don’t know, irony, I guess, and Scott gives a grave speech about how she was the most dedicated professional he ever met in the REF, which goes to show that even when he’s being nice, he’s also a massive hypocrite. 
 
As the episode closes without any sign of Reflex Point, the narrator works harder to get up our hopes that Admiral Hunter will be turning up any minute. 
 
I… don’t think he can be trusted… 
 
But they wouldn’t keep mentioning Admiral Hunter this much if he wasn’t going to turn up in the final episode, right? RIGHT?

649,"What is a reasonable number of coffees per day? 

""I had 10 yesterday,"" said the young woman drinking a 4pm latte at the local bakery cafe. That seems like rather a lot – maybe I mis-overheard her.

Down the road at the Italian fruit and veg barn the checkout operator was sipping from a takeaway cup. ""Hot water,"" she said. ""I'm coffeed out. I had two at home this morning and two here.""

""How are your caffeine levels?"" is a common greeting in the specialty coffee business, where drinking too much is an occupational hazard. But how much is too much?

Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines are reassuringly vague: ""Enjoy in moderation."" In the US, the Mayo Clinic hedges: up to 400 milligrams of caffeine a day ""appears to be safe for most healthy adults"". That's about four filter cups a day, or as many as six espressos on American caffeine content figures – fewer with the higher-dose espresso shots common in Australia.

The real question is not ""How much?"" but ""How many is reasonable?""

In Finland the mid-morning coffee break is legislated into working conditions: as usual, Scandinavia leads in progressive social policy. In Australia it's more of a common law right; the only question is how much time you can spend away from work organising it.

The mid-morning takeaway could be your second of the day if you ""need"" caffeine to get moving in the morning. One on the way back to the office after lunch would make three – still within the health guidelines, though buying two a day makes coffee a budget line item of its own.

The appearance of Jawbones and Fitbits gives you the means, with a bit of honest cup-accounting and daily scrutiny of the sleep graph, to see when that third or fourth cup has sent you into sleep debt.

But the accounting is complicated by an outbreak at cafes offering batch-brewed filter coffee supported by floor staff bearing refills … how many is that now?

The physical symptoms of over-caffeination include jitters, anxiety, palpitations, increased heart rate, nausea and sweating: not really apparent to casual waitstaff bearing vacupots​ until you get down the list to cardiac arrest, by which time it's too late.

Certificate IV in responsible service of caffeinated drinks, anyone?

Emerging dental methods allow everyone from scaredy cats to those with challenging dental issues to achieve perfect smiles reports SantaRosaCosmeticDentist.com 

Santa Rosa, CA, United States of America - September 23, 2015 /MarketersMedia/ -- 

Today's society treats a person's appearance much like a career asset, in that a great deal of importance is placed on something as simple as a smile. In many cases, the first impression a person makes on another, be it for a job, a first date or meeting the in-laws, has much to do with the appearance of their teeth and the quality of smile which goes with it. For this reason, the US -- and California in particular -- have seen a dramatic increase in the number of cosmetic dental procedures in recent years. And while research shows most employers consider a person's smile to be an extremely important part of the appearance, from a psychological standpoint, whiter teeth and a bright smile convey trust. 
 
According to Santa Rosa Dentist Mark S. Frey, DDS , major changes are not always needed to improve a person's appearance or feelings about themselves. Says Frey, ""Even a subtle change in a smile helps to project an image of self-confidence and high personal esteem. When a person feels good about themselves, it shows in their appearance. While the first procedure most people think of is teeth whitening, there are a number of other procedures someone can use to improve their smile."" 
 
Mark S. Frey, DDS , a local general, family, and cosmetic dentist in Santa Rosa for 20 years, says technology has improved significantly in recent years allowing a great deal more than good oral health. Dr. Frey explains, saying, ""Although our primary mission is always better oral health, cosmetic dentistry goes well beyond this. We recognize that restored confidence in one's smile and appearance can be beneficial to patients as well. We are here to help individuals not only achieve proper oral health and hygiene, but also to provide a long-lasting positive impression on the people in their lives. This goal is aligned with our ongoing mission to remain Santa Rosa's Best Family and Cosmetic Dentist ."" 
 
For many patients he's seen in his two decades of practice, comments Dr. Frey, the goal of achieving a beautiful smile comes at a price of overcoming their fear of dentists. ""We understand that sometimes the fear of going to the dentist may prevent patients from seeking out proper oral care and maintenance. To help with this, we offer an oral conscious sedation option to patients."" This type of treatment is especially helpful for those who require a great deal of work done in a short period of time, says Frey. ""Oral conscious sedation can be a life-changing opportunity to receive the dental care needed, or the smile that you've always been hoped for."" 
 
About Mark S. Frey, DDS: 
 
Established in 1996, Mark S. Frey, DDS is a family dental practice offering comprehensive general and cosmetic dental care. Their focus is providing exceptional state-of-the-art dentistry in an atmosphere of comfort and compassion. The practice employs the latest in dental technology such as digital x-rays, fluorescent light cavity detection, Invisalign, and in-office tooth whitening and the Waterlase, which allows them to perform many types of fillings and gum treatments without the need for using a local anesthetic. For entertainment and distraction, overhead monitors allow patients to watch their favorite tv shows or movies during treatment. 
 
Dr. Frey hails from Pasadena, CA. He is a graduate of the University of Southern California School of Dentistry and completed a general practice residency in hospital dentistry at Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center in Downey, CA. Prior to coming to Santa Rosa, he served as the Director of Dental Services at Maua Methodist Hospital in Kenya.

2829,"Study found those who turned to whole grains and healthy fats saw a drop in heart risks. 
By Emily Willingham 
HealthDay Reporter 
 
TUESDAY, Sept. 29, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- When trimming saturated fat from your diet, subbing in whole-grain foods helps your heart, but turning to white bread doesn't, a new study shows. 
 
""This is very important stuff,"" said Dr. Robert Vogel, a cardiologist at the University of Colorado, Denver, who wrote a commentary accompanying the published study. ""If you substitute high-quality carbohydrates like fruits, vegetables and whole grains, then lives are saved. It's that simple."" 
 
""Folks don't just spontaneously drop a few hundred calories of saturated fat out of their diets without replacing them with something else,"" explained study first co-author Adela Hruby, a research fellow at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. ""The 'something else' makes a difference to their health."" 
 
The study and the commentary were both published online Sept. 28 in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology . 
 
Hruby and her colleagues based their conclusions on information from close to 85,000 women and almost 43,000 men, all participants in two long-running investigations, the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. 
 
All of the men and women were free of diabetes, heart disease and cancer when they signed on. Researchers tracked details on many aspects of the participants' lives, including their diets. 
 
Hruby and her colleagues assessed results of food questionnaires completed by the study volunteers every four years. During a follow-up period of up to three decades, coronary heart disease was diagnosed in more than 7,600 participants. 
 
The study authors compared self-reported food frequencies between those who did and did not develop heart disease. 
 
The researchers found that when the men and women replaced 5 percent of their saturated fat calories with healthier polyunsaturated fats, such as those found in nuts, the risk for coronary heart disease dropped by 25 percent. 
 
Replacement with monounsaturated fats such as olive oil dropped risk by 15 percent, and replacement with whole-grain carbs was linked with a 9 percent decrease in heart disease risk. 
 
But subbing in processed carbs such as white bread or white rice for saturated fat had no effect on risk for heart disease. 
 
This lack of effect means that saturated fat, found in animal products like butter and red meat, looks neutral for heart disease only when it's compared to eating refined carbs and sugar instead. Compared to other options, though, it's the non-heart-healthy choice. 
 
However, the study only found an association between dietary fats and heart risk, not a cause-and-effect relationship. 
 
""When you compare it to other types of fat or whole grains, saturated fat is not benign, as some recent studies appear to have suggested,"" said Hruby. 
 
Vogel emphatically agreed. ""People need to know that saturated fat is bad, and numerous studies have shown this,"" he said. 
 
The findings also mean that consumers should get rid of saturated fat, said Michelle Cardel, a spokesperson for the Obesity Society and an assistant professor in the department of health outcomes and policy at the University of Florida, in Gainesville. 
 
""Rather than trying to add more healthy fat into your diet, the focus should be on replacing saturated fats with healthy fats,"" Cardel said. ""You can replace them with foods high in healthy fats, including fatty fish like salmon, avocados, nuts and seeds."" 
 
Vogel has some very specific advice for the health-conscious consumer. ""If you insist on meat, eat lean meat,"" he said. ""Poultry would be better than [red] meat, white meat poultry would be better than dark meat, and fish would be better than poultry."" 
 
When it comes to carbs, said Vogel, check the nutrition labels for two key features of whole grains. ""A whole grain is something where the first ingredient says 'whole grain,' not the third or the fifth, but the first,"" he said. The second feature is that the whole-grain food contains at least 3 grams of fiber per serving. He added, ""5 grams would be better, 7 would be better still."" 
 
Replacing saturated fat with healthier fats and healthy carbs doesn't mean sacrificing taste, said Hruby. Pointing to foods with healthier polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, such as walnuts, salmon and olive oil, she noted that ""many of these foods have been a part of other delicious dietary patterns, like the Mediterranean diet, for decades, maybe even centuries."" 
 
Cardel agreed. ""People tend to love foods with higher quality fats, like avocados, nuts and seeds,"" she said, but acknowledged that ""sometimes people are a little bit wearier of high-quality carbohydrates. Starting with more familiar healthy carbohydrates, such as fruit, oatmeal, beans and whole-wheat bread can make the transition easier."" 
 
Vogel said that people don't need to retrain their taste buds to eat healthier -- ""they have to retrain their brains.""

3058,"According to our 2015 calendar, summer isn’t quite over yet. But that’s not stopping Kenny Chesney and Miranda Lambert from gearing up for the hottest ticket of next summer. 

Fresh off his record-breaking Big Revival Tour, Chesney announced on Tuesday a brand new summer 2016 tour with Lambert on tap to join the stadium shows. 

This isn’t the first time the country superstars have joined forces on stage. Lambert opened for Chesney back in 2009 and in June of this year, she made a guest appearance singing “You and Tequila” during Chesney’s tour stop in Chicago. 

“She’s got so much soul and grit, heart and the ability to get to the core of a song,” Chesney exclusively told ETonline. “Thinking about what song would make sense, well, she’s the kinda woman who understands that complicated feeling of waiting for something that’s not good for you, but feels so good.” 

At the time, Chesney kept mum about a potential in-studio collaboration with Lambert — but clearly those creative juices were flowing! 

“Miranda is the real deal,” Chesney said in a press release on Tuesday. “She’s a songwriter, first, and a real vocalist. She’s puts it all out there when she’s on stage, and I loved touring with her so much in 2009, I can’t believe it’s taken us this long to get her back out here – because I love every single thing about who she is as an artist and a person.” 

Specific tour dates have not yet been announced, but we do know that Chesney has tapped Sam Hunt and Old Dominion to serve as the opening acts. Both artists had previously penned hits for Chesney, including “Come Over” and “Save It For A Rainy Day,” respectively. 

“The second I heard Sam’s demo for ‘Come Over,’ I knew he was onto something very unique,” Chesney, who gave Hunt his first cut, said. “Watching him develop as an artist, seeing his songwriting evolve – and knowing how he brings it when he gets onstage makes him a perfect act to come out with us. He’s fun, alive and all about the music.” 

Fans who saw Chesney’s Big Revival Tour this summer should already be familiar with Old Dominion (“Break Up With Him”), who will kick off this next tour with a longer set. Their debut LP, Meat and Candy, is out Nov. 6. 

No word on when we can expect new tunes from Chesney, but Lambert has been pouring herself into the creative process ever since news broke that she and Blake Shelton had divorced in July. Get the scoop on her latest writing sessions in the video below.

4163,"Ever since a little kid I was obese, in sixth grade my weight was 62kilograms, which when I recall is average weight of my classmates in engineering final year! It's not the weight that's important now, it's the humiliation I went through, every hallway I remember where I was ridiculed, people and my mates saying hey fatass, dumbo, motu! I cried, as I was publicly ashamed, both the weight and humiliation grew with my age, in my engineering first year, in the year 2012 I happen to reach my heaviest size and weight 118 kilograms, and yeah the amount of criticism I'd to face too increased exponentially, I was told right on my face that one day I won't fit through one of the class doors, they said to me I eat like elephant and look like elephant, well I'm talking about friends, who said all these right on my face. I was compared to all the funny looking things in the world which are heavy and huge, I cried! But, but, but.....  Posting this today, I currently weigh 90.7 kilograms, and lot leaner, and lot stronger, stronger physically and extremely mentally! I say, the world isn't for the weak minded, it's not about how strong you're either, it's about how deeper you dig in yourself and how hard were you pushed and how strong and tall you bounced back! It's still not how hard the opponent punches you and pushes you to ground, it's all about how much will power you still have to face him/her and say right on the face, "" I'm ready to tear you apart"", remember the opponent here can be anything, it can be the society, it can be your fears it can be the person who insulted you, it can be a disease! I was fighting with me, I was pushing myself to my extreme boundaries, my mind wasn't ready for all the treatment I was giving to my physical body, but still that drop of determination I always had and that mental ego that said, "" shut the hell up and move your ass!"". I am not weak, I'm the stronger me!

921,"In the 1st inning on Monday night, the Mets loaded the bases with nobody out. Perhaps two weeks ago an extended rally was certain, particularly with the team facing the completely moribund Braves. Now that the air has seemingly been let out of the Mets, it didn't seem like such a guaranteed proposition. Lucas Duda popped out for the first out. Travis d'Arnaud followed by hitting what looked like a sure Double Play ball right to Adonis Garcia at 3rd. I groaned, because at least that's what I figured would be the case. But Yoenis Cespedes slid hard into 2nd and took Daniel Castro out of the play, allowing d'Arnaud to reach and Curtis Granderson to score.
Lost in this play was Daniel Murphy, who had been running from 2nd to 3rd on the play and pulled up to try to avoid getting tagged out. However, Murphy then apparently decided he'd had enough of this and turned towards second to watch the play, as opposed to doing his job and continuing to run to 3rd. By time it dawned on him that he probably should have done that, it was unfortunately too late as Garcia threw back to Overratedton Simmons and Murphy was tagged out to end the inning, a rather odd but perfectly Murphian 5-4-6 Double Play.
In the 3rd inning, Jon Niese, who by this point had retired the first 8 Braves to face him, all on ground balls, walked Shelby Miller, the opposing pitcher. This was bad enough, but Shelby Miller, hitting .059 on the season is clearly a lousy hitter even for a pitcher. Michael Bourn followed by hitting a clean single through the right side. Castro followed by grounding to short, but Wilmer Flores' throw was a little wide and pulled Lucas Duda off the base at 1st and Castro was aboard on the error. By now, you probably had a good sense of where this was heading. Niese has made a career out of letting these minor irritants snowball into full-blown bloodbaths. This season, it's probably happened to him every other time he's taken the mound. Freddie Freeman, who was due for a good Met-killing moment, was coming to the plate. Everything was once again about to go haywire.
But it didn't. Freeman hit a rope to center that kind of knuckled a little bit, but Cespedes caught the ball and the Braves were turned away.
The Mets, in addition to their ill-gotten 1st inning run, had every opportunity to run Shelby Miller out of the building. Michael Conforto hit a Home Run in the 2nd inning, another opposite-field shot, as his power display continues to impress. Miller then came about as close to completely unraveling as you can, but the Mets ultimately let him off the hook. He walked Niese, walked Granderson and was honing in on 60 pitches in the 2nd inning. For Miller, a good pitcher, this season must be so demoralizing. He hasn't won a game in what, 22 straight starts? Somehow, he sucked it up and got through 6 innings, which is a credit to him.
So, Niese survived his attack of himself and managed to make it through 6 innings, although I think he may have been pre-emptively removed as he'd only thrown 87 pitches. Then again, with Niese, you try not to press your luck. Addison Reed threw a clean 7th inning. The Mets doubled their lead when Murphy double home 2 runs and remembered to keep running until he reached his intended base. Tyler Clippard returned to the mound with a mostly uneventful 8th inning (if you consider a hit and two Wild Pitches uneventful) and Jeurys Familia, though not in a Save situation, closed out a sanity-saving 4-0 victory.
This was my 20th game of the season at Citi Field, a lofty number that I haven't reached since 1999, and for those 20 games, this is the 13th the Mets have won. There becomes less and less to say about these games as the days wind down because basically, either the Mets win or the game stunk. Fortunately, the Mets won. The crowd seemed partially into things, which was OK. Last Monday, the game I was at was basically amateur hour because I found myself sitting around people that weren't paying attention to the game altogether. There were also about 12,000 fans there and this was a relevant team playing a relevant game. Of course, last week, the Mets were playing the irrelevant Marlins. Last night, the crowd was a bit heartier, even though they were playing the equally irrelevant Braves. I wonder if the fans are finally starting to develop a bit of a sense of urgency here. Lord knows the Mets could use the extra energy.",41d0959b-ba60-4f93-86c2-b86e644719c4,Blog,2015-09-23T04:00:11Z,The Ballclub,That's Much Better,1.0,Blog
968,"Government has issued a directive to Municipal and Districts Assemblies (MDAs) to be circumspect in their spending as it makes adjustment to expected revenue from the export of crude oil. 
 

 
Finance Minister Seth Tekpeh 
 
The directive means that most of the country’s MDAs who rely on government for funding would have to alter their expenditure pattern or devise legitimate means of generating internal fund to supplement their operations. 
 
Issuing the directive, Finance Minister Mr. Seth Terkper cautioned local government heads not to engage in unplanned expenditures to help maintain the medium term fiscal consolidation objectives of the government. 
 
“In this regard, MDAs that are funded from the Annual Budget Funding Amount (ABFA) are to control their expenditure within the Budget allotments provided by the Ministry of Finance”, he said. 
 
Earlier this year, government reviewed expected revenue from the export of crude oil from 95 US dollars per barrel to 57 US dollars per barrel. 
 
However, the fast fall in the price of oil to US 45.70 dollars per barrel means that Ghana’s external source of income will decrease, putting pressure on the national purse. 
 
Fiscal deficit reduction 
 
Ghana’s 2015 budget aims at reducing the fiscal deficit from 10.2 percent of GDP in 2014 to 7.3 percent of GDP in 2015. 
 
There has been two adjustments of the budget deficit mainly on account of crude oil price developments. 
 
Preliminary data for the first half of the year indicate that, total revenue and grants was higher than the target for the period. 
 
At the same time, total expenditure including the clearance of arrears was lower than target. 
As a result the cash fiscal deficit for the period was 2.3 percent of GDP against a target of 3.4 percent. This compares to a deficit of 4.3 percent of GDP for the same period in 2014. 
 
The total revenue and grants for the period was 11.2 percent of GDP, against a target of 10.6 percent of GDP. 
 
In nominal terms, the outturn was 5.4 percent higher than target and 32.9 percent higher than the outturn for the same period in 2014. 
 
Ghana’s good performance in total revenue and grants was mainly due to a strong growth in domestic revenue. 
 
Tax income 
 
Tax revenue amounted to GH¢11,403.9 million, 8.4 percent higher than the Budget target of GH¢10,516.3 million. 
 
In nominal terms tax revenue was 32.1 percent higher than the outturn recorded for the same period in 2014. 
 
The strong performance in tax revenue was mainly due to the good performance of petroleum taxes, VAT and trade taxes resulting from the imposition of the Special Petroleum Tax and exchange rate depreciation as well as improved revenue administration and efficiency. 
 
GDP estimates for first half of 2015 
 
Total expenditure, including payments for the clearance of arrears for the first half of 2015 amounted to GH¢18,068.5 million (13.5 percent of GDP) against a target of GH¢18,805.7 million (equivalent to 14.0 percent of GDP). 
 
The outturn was 3.9 percent lower than the budget target but 14.1 percent higher than the outturn for the same period in 2014. 
 
The growth in expenditure was mainly due to higher spending on goods and services and foreign financed capital expenditure. 
 
The cash fiscal deficit of 2.3 percent of GDP for the period under review was financed mainly from domestic sources, resulting in a Net Domestic Financing (NDF) of the budget of GH¢1. 875.4 million (1.4 percent of GDP). 
 
The NDF for the period was 57.3 percent lower than the budget target of GH¢4,395.1 million and 48.6 percent lower than the outturn for the same period in 2014. 
 
Foreign Financing of the budget was GH¢1,218.0 million representing 39.4 percent of total financing, against a target of GH¢206.1 million. 
 
Thus domestic financing constituted about 60.6 percent of the total financing of the deficit for the first six months of the year.",b38e92ee-e1b4-4188-adc7-3bc36854d7fb,News,2015-09-07T15:04:13Z,Spy Ghana,Reduce your expenditure or face our wrath – government tells assemblies,0.0,News
242,"STORY BY LAUREN VELASCO As a new election cycle kicks into full gear, Drake professor and alum Jennifer Glover Konfrst is beginning her political campaign to be District 43’s Representative in the Iowa House. Konfrst would represent the cities of Clive, West Des Moines, and Windsor Heights. Konfrst is also a professor in public relations and political advocacy. When it comes to having two different jobs, she knows how to keep them separate from one another. “I see myself as wearing two separate hats. These paths are parallel but are never crossing,” Konfrst said. Although Konfrst is a novice to the campaigning process, she is familiar with policy and legislation. Aside from teaching political advocacy, Konfrst has also worked for the US Senate. Konfrst’s political background makes her no stranger to Iowa District 43 either. She has several ideas that she hopes to implement if she is elected. “I feel like this is a time when my skills in public service are needed to bring people together and not keep dividing them,” Konfrst said. One of Konfrst’s main focuses is on the public education system in Des Moines. The low funding for public education and mental health programs provides a challenging but necessary goal for Konfrst. “It is very important to me that public education and mental health programs are funded in Iowa because everyone deserves to be treated well by the state,” Konfrst said. Konfrst has an important group of people helping her throughout her campaign. One notable volunteer is Drake PR alum Taylor Larson. “Before attending Drake, I had no background in politics. But by living in Des Moines, you just get immersed in the political atmosphere,” Larson said. Larson is currently a first-year law student and hopes to someday work in policy and legislation. After graduating from Drake as an undergraduate in public relations she has always stayed close to Konfrst. “(Konfrst) would be a great representative. I know she is listening (to her district) and she would be a great person for the job,” Larson said. “She would do everything in her power to let people know what’s going on.” State Senator of Iowa Janet Peterson is also one of Konfrst’s supporters for the election process. She endorsed Konfrst’s campaign and will volunteer for her as well. Peterson has served in the Iowa Legislature for 15 years total, as a representative and as a senator. “I love it when I see great people make a decision to run for public office. That’s why I was thrilled to see my friend Jennifer Konfrst announce her run for the Iowa House,” Peterson said.“She’s smart and successful. She shares our Democratic values and she knows how to get things done,” Konfrst and her outside team of supporters and volunteers will work towards getting a primary election, which will take place in June of 2016, followed by the general election in November of 2016. In the meantime, Konfrst will continue to advocate her goals for District 43. “When I make changes, I want to make sure people are represented fairly and all voices are heard equally.”",31019551-536c-4752-a10e-3d659d13beb9,Blog,2015-09-17T00:05:09Z,The Times-Delphic,Journalism professor to run on platform of education reform,1.0,Blog

3392,"Robert Williamson (Photo: Advertiser file photo) 

Robert T. Williamson, of Lafayette, the former private investigator at the center of a bribery scheme involving the Lafayette-area district attorney’s office, was sentenced Friday to six-and-a-half years in a federal prison. 

He must surrender to authorities by 2 p.m. Nov. 12. 

Williamson, 67, a former Rapides Parish resident, pleaded guilty June 8 to one count each of conspiracy to commit bribery, bribery involving a program that receives federal funds and Social Security fraud. 

U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Foote, prior to sentencing, said Williamson was the mastermind behind the bribery scheme, convincing and bribing five others with no prior criminal activity into participating. 

Between 2008 and 2012, Williamson paid three employees of the district attorney’s office to bypass the normal judicial process to quickly resolve cases for his clients. The cases involved mostly drunk driving offenses, but also drug cases and felony cases. 

He also bribed workers at a nonprofit and a driver’s education business to forge documents saying his clients completed community service and driver’s ed classes when they did not. 

Williamson was the subject of a 2001 Town Talk series about his disputes with law enforcement officials and insurance companies related to electrical shock injuries his wife, Sonya, suffered in 1989 at an Alexandria hotel. His wife, a Glenmora native, was left with debilitating injuries. 

Authorities were suspicious about Sonya’s injuries because of numerous previous insurance claims filed by members of the Williamson family, but doctors said Sonya’s injuries were real. 

In the Lafayette case, Williamson, who is not an attorney, was paid as much as $5,000 by his clients. 

On Friday, when Williamson’s attorney asked for a reduced sentence, claiming there was no victim, Foote disagreed. 

“The victim in this matter is the public trust,” she said. “And that’s far worse than if Mr. Williamson had simply stolen money from an individual.” 

Williamson addressed the court, saying, “I apologize to the community and the court ... I am greatly sorry for what I caused.” 

Thomas Damico, Williamson’s attorney, argued unsuccessfully for a lesser sentence, saying the scheme would not have happened without the cooperation of Barna Haynes, the long-time secretary to former district attorney Mike Harson. Haynes, 61, is serving 18 months in a federal prison after pleading guilty for her role in the conspiracy. 

The plot worked this way. Williamson paid Haynes to transfer cases from city court to district court, to fill out documents and to schedule his clients to appear before a judge outside of the normal court process. 

Greg Williams, the assistant district attorney who handled all of those cases, also accepted gifts and cash from Williamson. His secretary, Denease Curry, knew of the payments and failed to report the bribery. 

Williamson also paid Sandra Degeyter, an Acadiana Outreach Center employee, in cash and in-kind contributions to falsify certificates stating his clients completed court-ordered community service work when they had not. After Degeyter left the nonprofit, she allegedly split the bribes with Elaine Crump, who still worked at the outreach center. 

Williamson also paid Lawrence Bergeron of Safety Premiere Training to create false and fraudulent driver safety certificates.The federal government did not pursue charges against Bergeron. 

With the bribery system in place, Williamson’s clients were able to appear before a judge faster than through the normal court process and present “proof” that they completed the usual court-ordered community service work. As a result, they would never lose their driver’s license and their charge would be wiped off their record faster thanks to Haynes. 

The Social Security fraud charge against Williamson is because he received $77,677 in Social Security payments while claiming he had no income even though he was receiving income from the bribery scheme, federal officials claim. 

Haynes pleaded guilty in July to one count of conspiracy to commit bribery. She is serving 18 months in the Carswell Federal Medical Facility, a medium-security prison/medical facility in Fort Worth, Texas. 

Williams, 47, and Degeyter, 64, both pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bribery and were sentenced to two years probation and six months of home confinement. 

Curry, 49, and Crump, 62, both pleaded guilty to one count of misprision of a felony for failing to report the bribes. They were sentenced to two years probation and 200 hours of community service. 

The case was investigated by the FBI and Social Security Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys John Luke Waller and Robert Abendroth prosecuted the case.

229,"15 de septiembre de 2015,   15:52 Rome, 15 Sep (Prensa Latina) Argentinian super star Diego Maradona has trashed the idea of UEFA President Michel Platini succeeding Sepp Blatter as new FIFA president. 
 Argentinian football legend Maradona suggests Platini is every bit as corrupt as the disgraced, outgoing Blatter.  He has also suggested he'll stand by the side of another candidate come election time. 
During an appearance on Naples television station PiuEnne  Maradona made it clear he considers voting for Platini as merely a vote to continue the same culture of corruption that has recently defined football's governing body: ""Blatter did a lot of harm to football and with Platini, it's a farce. They pretend to be separated, one at FIFA and the other at UEFA, while in fact they were always side by side."" 

Maradona didn't stop there. He stressed that Platini is no different than Blatter and that the Frenchman is the wrong man to introduce much needed change at the top of the sport: ""If we want a transparent FIFA, we cannot vote for Platini who has been close to Blatter, who taught him how to steal."" 

The controversial former World Cup winner revealed he will back Prince Ali of Jordan for the presidency.    Maradona even intends to work alongside Ali should the Prince win: ""If he should win the election, I will be at his side as vice-president.""

4906,"The aspect ratio of any given movie literally frames our experience of the entire work. Whereas real-life exists in 360 degrees in all directions, filmmakers must make very conscious decisions about what to put inside that box, what to exclude from it, and how to present it all to the audience. 
 
For the most part, movies stick to a few standard widescreen aspect ratios, or, if the filmmaker is feeling a bit daring, the less common 4:3 aspect ratio. (For example, Fish Tank  and  Ida .) But one video essay argues there’s been a rise in experimentation with non-traditional aspect ratios, including films that change proportions mid-scene (i.e., Tom at the Farm or  Life of Pi ) or reject the idea of a rectangular frame altogether (Gust Van den Berghe’s  Lucifer ). Watch and learn after the jump.

2133,"St. Jude Medical Gains CE Mark for 27mm & 29mm Portico TAVR Valves to Complete a Full Portfolio of Portico Sizing Options for Physicians Treating Patients with Aortic Stenosis  
The latest approval increases patient access to the Portico system, a TAVR valve that provides excellent patient outcomes and the opportunity to optimize device placement 

ST. PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 

St. Jude Medical, Inc. (STJ), a global medical device company, today announced the European CE Mark approval for the 27mm and 29mm Portico™ Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement System. The approval follows previous approvals of the 23mm and 25mm Portico valves, allowing St. Jude Medical to offer physicians an expanded range of fully repositionable, retrievable TAVR valve sizes. The Portico valve accommodates a patient’s native anatomy with diameters ranging from 19 to 27 mm. 

Aortic stenosis is one of the most common forms of cardiovascular disease in the world, and develops as the aortic heart valve becomes calcified, narrowing the valve and preventing a complete opening. Over time, aortic stenosis disrupts the blood flow from the heart, which causes the heart to pump harder and results in weakening. TAVR procedures provide physicians an additional treatment option for patients with severe aortic stenosis who are considered high risk for open heart surgery. 

“Aortic stenosis is a serious, potentially life-threatening condition for patients who are unable to receive a traditional open-heart valve transplant,” said Dr. Helge Mollmann, the cardiology head of Transcatheter Valve Therapies at Kerckhoff Heart Center Bad Nauheim, Germany. “Transcatheter aortic valve replacement has revolutionized how we treat these patients, and by offering a complete portfolio of Portico valve sizing options, St. Jude Medical has further helped broaden the patient population that can be treated with this family of valves.” 

The Portico system was developed to simplify TAVR procedures for physicians by improving control, ease of use and accuracy over other commercially-available TAVR valves. The system offers the ability for the Portico valve to be fully recaptured and repositioned prior to full deployment and release from the delivery system, providing physicians more options to place the valve in the targeted location. The Portico system has also demonstrated low rates of permanent pacemaker utilizations post valve implant as a result of heart block and was designed to minimize the risk of paravalvular leak (a leakage of blood caused by a space between the heart tissue and a replacement valve). 

“Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is a complex procedure, and feedback from physicians worldwide has continued to press upon us the fact that offering a system that provides physicians more control and a simplified procedure is important,” said Eric Fain, M.D., group president at St. Jude Medical. “In developing our Portico valve, we took such feedback into account, designing a full portfolio of sizing to ensure physicians could comfortably rely on one device family for a range of patients.” 

During a transfemoral implant procedure, the Portico valve is delivered by catheter through the femoral artery in the leg and is positioned while the patient’s heart continues to beat. Use of the Portico valve alleviates the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, which involves a machine taking over a patient’s heart and lung function during surgery and can cause added strain on an already frail heart. 

The 23mm the 25mm Portico Transcatheter Aortic Heart Valve are both CE Mark approved and commercially available in Europe. In the United States, the Portico valve is currently being evaluated in a clinical trial through an investigational device exemption (IDE) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Portico IDE trial originally launched in May 2014, and is designed to support U.S. approval of the Portico system.

575,"Days before a stop in Cuba on his way to the United States, Pope Francis on Thursday told young people from both countries that government heads who fail to plant the seeds of future leadership are ""worthless ... dictators."" 
 
Francis, who was elected in 2013, has been credited for being the chief advocate for renewing diplomatic ties between Washington and Havana. 

The Pope on Thursday responded from the Vatican to questions from students in Havana and New York during a CNN en Español teleconference on his Scholas initiative, which seeks to bring young people together via sports, art and technology. The event was held in partnership with the United Nations Children's Fund. 

Asked by a Cuban student about the example of his leadership, Francis said, ""I will tell you one thing, a good leader is one who is capable of bringing up other leaders. If a leader wants to lead alone, he is a tyrant. True leadership is fruitful. Each one of you has the seed of leadership."" 

He added, ""The leaders of today will not be here tomorrow. If they do not plant the seed of leadership in others, they are worthless. They are dictators."" 

Francis, the first pope from Latin America, earned praise from both U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro for helping restart relations between the neighboring countries. 

In July, the two countries reopened embassies in Havana and Washington. 

Pope Francis' whirlwind tour to Cuba and the United States begins Saturday, when he arrives in Havana for a trip that includes mass at Revolution Square, a meeting with government officials and a visit to the Shrine of Our Lady of Charity del Cobre, the island's patron saint. 

The Pope will be the third consecutive leader of the Roman Catholic Church to visit Cuba. St. John Paul II stopped there for several days in 1998, and Pope Benedict XVI visited for three days in 2012. 

Relations between the Vatican and Cuba, strained during the 49-year rule of communist dictator Fidel Castro, have improved since the younger Castro replaced his sickly brother as president. 

Cuba was officially atheist from 1962-1992, and an annual State Department report issued last year said religious activity there is only allowed ""if explicitly authorized"" by the government. The Catholic Church estimates between 60% and 70% of Cubans are baptized. 

Another Cuban student Friday urged the Pope to remember the poor and marginalized and to pray for a lifting of the longstanding U.S. embargo against Cuba. 

Francis said he would do ""all that is possible"" to ""build bridges"" and foster communication leading to friendship. 

Previous popes, such as St. John Paul II, who was raised in communist Poland, had little love for totalitarian states but believed that sanctions impoverished ordinary Cubans and isolated a government that might be won over through careful diplomacy.",2e812da1-1e5a-40f4-bf42-273a9a43aa6f,News,2015-09-18T16:01:46Z,KOAT,Pope Francis criticizes 'dictators.'

Andujar was to be honored in his hometown of San Pedro de Macoris on Tuesday and buried Wednesday. 

The right-hander finished his major league career with a 127-118 record and a 3.58 ERA with the Cardinals, Houston Astros and Oakland Athletics. He was named to the All-Star team four times in 13 seasons and helped the Cardinals win the 1982 World Series, posting a 2-0 record against the Milwaukee Brewers in the Fall Classic, including a victory in Game 7. 

In 1984 and 1985, Andujar won 20 and 21 games and finished fourth in the National League Cy Young Award voting both years. He was considered one of baseball's top pitchers in the 1980s.

We're talking Bettie Page bangs, and considering Rita Ora is the fourth celebrity we've spotted with them in the past few weeks, we can safely say retro short fringe is a thing. Other sightings have been on Kim and Kourtney Kardashian at a photo shoot and on Taraji P. Henson. And the best news about bangs like these is that they're easy to get via a wiglet (like this one from classyrebel.com), so you don't even have to commit to them. But if you want to go for a real chop, keep mind that you should tread carefully if your face is very short and wide or very long and thin. For the far ends of the spectrum, a long face will just look longer and for short-faced ladies, your bangs will have to be so short to get air between your brows and your fringe that you may wind up looking like you have a nail brush glued to your forehead.

It is basically twisted pair of cable with some improvement done on it to improve transmission speed up to one hundred megabits in a second. Many homeowners, businesses and office owners at one time in their lives they are faced with the decision select which type or kind of wiring to install for the purposes of network. Cat 5 cabling Dallas has for many years now been predominantly chosen by many users but recently there are several options available to select from. 
 
Blocks that are commonly known as punch downs and also modular connectors are used to connect such cables. Most of cat 5 is not shielded and they rely on a design pair that is twisted and with a balanced line and also differential signaling that is used for rejection of noise. This can be terminated using T568A scheme and also T568B scheme. These two schemes has the potential to work very well and can be assorted in installation as long as similar scheme is being utilized on both sides or ends of that cable. 
 
Each of these four pairs found in such a cable contains different and specific number or quantity of twist that is per meter which reduces crosstalk among the pairs. Although these cable assemblies consist of four pairs this type is not totally limited to only four pairs. An application known as the backbone they use more than one thousand pairs. 
 
Balanced lines assist in preventing or protecting the signal from being interfered with by noise. The cable is known to exist in stranded and also solid conductor forms. The stranded type is regarded as flexible and durable as it can withstand any kind of bending without necessary breaking. 
 
The cost saving as an advantage means that the cost of purchasing and installing the system should not cost one a lot of money. They are the least expensive cables of them all for networking and also cameras. It can efficiently support four signals at a time implying that very little cable will be required to transfer signals among cameras or even computers which are close enough to each other. 
 
The next form is stranded conductor which generally is utilized to connect wall sockets to available computers in that room. This kind of wiring can be very flexible if installed by a professional person. The versatility of such a cable makes it good for various applications like the computer networks as well as telephone cabling even though there are better wires available in such a market. 
 
The next advantage is data transfer. This kind of wiring has its fair share of limitations and most specifically in an environment that is faced with constant changes in terms of technology. The first disadvantage of such a cable is the limited amount of data that can be transmitted through it. 
 
The potential of process at a speed of 100 megabits that is per second definitely met the needs of computers users then than it is the case today. As organizations grow and expand their data processing needs also grows and they now start processing large amounts of data through a single network creating the need for more advanced options. That is why the cat 5e was developed to improve on the weaknesses of the previous version.

927,"Carrots in baked goods don’t exactly constitute a serving of vegetables, especially considering that carrots typically make their appearance in layer cakes that are slathered with cream cheese frosting. While a classic carrot cake can be delicious, it isn’t the only way to bring carrots into your baked goods. These Whole Grain Harvest Carrot Muffins are a fantastic way to incorporate some carrots into your daily baking this season – no frosting required. 
 
These muffins start with a blend of regular all purpose and whole wheat flours. I avoided using all whole wheat flour because I did not want the muffins to feel to heavy or dense, and using a blend of flours gives them a much lighter texture. You can also use white whole wheat flour for both of the flours for a very similar result. The muffins are sweetened with brown sugar and a generous amount of spice before carrots are shredded up and stirred in to the batter. In these muffins, you can use regular orange carrots or rainbow carrots , which will add some flecks of color into the crumb of the muffins. After baking, the muffins are moist and tender, with some great spiciness a hint of nuttiness from the whole wheat flour blending into the sweet flavors of carrot and molasses (from the brown sugar). You’ll want to warm them up and serve them alongside a steaming mug of coffee on a cool morning, while you watch the colors of the leaves change. 
 
These muffins have an excellent flavor on their own, and I typically serve them as-is or with a side of whipped cream cheese. If you want to add a little more texture to your muffins, stir in half a cup of raisins or half a cup of chopped, toasted pecans. Both ingredients will add a bit of extra flavor to the muffins and are nice variations to have in your back pocket. The muffins are ready-to-eat on the day they are baked, however they will keep well for 1-2 days after baking when stored in an airtight container.

2368,"WAKARUSA — The staff and students of Wakarusa Elementary School invite the public to celebrate Patriot Day with a visit to the school gym Friday at 8:10 a.m. 
  
The school is located at 400 N. Washington St. near downtown Wakarusa. 
 
This annual tradition, more generally known as “National Anthem Day” for the school, began as a way to educate the students on the significance of the song, “The Star Spangled Banner,” which was penned in 1814 by Francis Scott Key as the War of 1812 was ending. 
 
According to vocal music teacher Shawn Skaggs, the realization that so few knew of the powerful message behind the lyrics was worth taking the time to educate. 
 
“The idea to start National Anthem Day came from a national poll which showed less than 40 percent of Americans today know the words to their national anthem, and many have little understanding of the meaning behind the text, and why they hear it sung or played at events across America,” Skaggs explained. 
 
This year marks the eighth commemoration of the event, “and it continues to be something the students look forward to yearly,” she added. In the days prior to this ceremony, the children spend time learning about the history of “The Star Spangled Banner,” as well as “the poetic language of the lyrics, the correct note values and melody, and the proper behaviors to demonstrate whether it’s sung or played,” Skaggs said. 
 
“This day has really become a chance for our students to reflect on what they’re truly thankful for in their everyday lives and what freedom means. Students have also learned and will present other patriotic songs demonstration their knowledge of our country’s heritage through music,” she said. The entire community is welcome to attend, with particular reverence for those who have been or are currently in service to America.

1133,"Verizon Still Scamming Customers: Tries To “Upsell” Me To 75Mbps, To Get Better Quality Netflix/iPhone Streaming This afternoon I called FiOS tech support to ask them to stop sending me emails about the pope’s schedule of when he is on TV and what channel to watch. Verizon provides no unsubscribe link and offers customers no way to opt out, so you have to call them to make the emails stop. I was transferred from tech support to sales who said they would remove me, but also told me that I should consider upgrading my 50Mbps service to 75Mbps a month as I was told that Verizon considers me a “heavy user” of their services. When I asked the rep how Verizon defines a “heavy user”, I was told that in the last 30 days, I have had 8 unique devices connect to my Internet connection. The rep also told me that I average between 30Mbps and 130Mbps a month, which of course makes no sense. If the rep was talking throughput, I max out at 50Mbps, there is no way I could be at 130Mbps. And if she was talking total bits delivered, 130MB would be almost nothing. I asked her if she was talking speed or throughput, but she didn’t know. She told me that based on my usage, I would get better quality Netflix streaming if I went from my current 50Mbps a month plan, to 75Mbps a month and wanted me to upgrade due to “current special offers”. When I asked her to explain to me how I would get better quality, she said if the Netflix movie were 75Mbps in size, it would download faster on a 75Mbps connection than my current 50Mbps connection. Of course we all know that Netflix doesn’t download anything, so her example is totally bogus. I explained this to the rep and pointed her to Netflix’s ISP Speed Index chart that shows for the month of August, Netflix streams delivered over Verizon averaged 3.64Mbps. So even if I had 8 devices all streaming Netflix at once, I would be at 29.12Mbps, still well below my current 50Mbps that I pay for each month. I’ve streamed HBO from 10 devices in my home, all at the same time, without any problems on my 50Mbps a month plan. Of course, the rep didn’t know what the Netflix’s ISP Speed Index chart was and still kept saying the word “download” in reference to Netflix. Not to be deterred, the rep then asked me if I had the new iPhone 6 and told me I should upgrade to 75Mbps if I did, as she said the new iPhone has “faster technology” that would work better if I had 75bps. Of course, she could not explain to me what the faster technology actually was and just used high-level and generic terms that mean nothing. When I again asked her to explain to me the difference between speed and throughput, she didn’t have an answer. This is the same Verizon FiOS scam I wrote about in April of this year. Time after time, I keep getting this same pitch from Verizon, trying to get me to upgrade my service based on a flat-out lie of “better”, “faster”, or “smoother” Netflix streaming. And why don’t their reps know the difference between speed and throughput?! Speed is the rate at which packets get from one location to another. Throughput is the average rate of successful message delivery over a communication channel. Simply saying the rep did not know or was not educated enough is not an excuse! When reps don’t know the basics, they will make stuff up. They have a responsibility to be accurate and set proper expectations with consumers as well as received the right kind of training on the services they are selling. If you think Netflix is “downloading” movies you should NOT be selling Internet services. Last time I blogged about this, Verizon said it was an isolated incident. It’s not. It’s widespread and I’ve gotten the same pitch four times now, all from different people inside the FiOS department. If Verizon is going to continue to deny to the media that they are actively trying to upsell consumers based on a lie, then I am going to start recording my calls with Verizon reps and posting them here on my blog, for everyone to hear. That will make it much harder for Verizon to say it’s an isolated incident. I am putting Verizon on notice that from here on out, every call I have with anyone in the FiOS group will be recorded. If someone from the FTC is reading this, please contact me. Verizon needs to be forced to stop this practice as the definition of a scam is, “to swindle someone by means of a trick”. That’s definitely what Verizon is doing; trying to “trick” consumers and many who don’t know better and don’t understand the technology will fall for it, and pay for something they do not need.",72399544-259f-4aee-9eaf-25f128d38704,Blog,2015-09-21T18:45:00Z,Media-Saver,"Verizon Still Scamming Customers: Tries To “Upsell” Me To 75Mbps, To Get Better Quality Netflix/iPhone Streaming",1.0,News
1687,"(CNN) -  
The Senate moved Wednesday to prevent the first part of a multi-step budget crisis when it voted overwhelmingly to keep the government funded through Dec. 11. 
 
The bill passed 78 to 20 and now goes to the House, which must act before midnight to prevent a shutdown, and House Republican leaders have said they plan to pass the bill in time. 

Meanwhile, top-level negotiations between Republican leaders in Congress and the White House to resolve the remaining steps -- including a longer-term government funding bill, an increase in the debt ceiling, approval of new funds for highway construction, passage of expiring tax provisions -- could begin ""very soon,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday. 

But those talks could be marred before even getting started after McConnell insisted in a phone call last week with President Barack Obama that House and Senate Democratic leaders not be allowed at the table, a demand the President refused to accept, multiple officials told CNN. 

McConnell has suggested for weeks he expected to open talks directly with the White House, bypassing Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, Sen. Chuck Schumer and other Democratic leaders with whom he has a tenuous relationship. A spokesman for McConnell wouldn't comment on why he wanted to bar Democrats from the talks. 

White House officials also declined to discuss the call, which took place last Thursday just before Obama met with Reid and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi in the Oval Office, according to a Pelosi aide. But they pointed to recent comments by White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest who said that Democrats must be part of any negotiation. 

Reid insisted Tuesday he would be part of any negotiations. 

""We've been calling for responsible budget negotiations for months,"" he said. ""If there are any talks, I will be invited."" 

McConnell said he hoped the stopgap spending measure would ""allow time for cooler heads to prevail."" 

News of the anticipated but long-awaited talks came days after House Speaker John Boehner, a known dealmaker, complicated the process by announcing he would leave Congress at the end of October. It was not clear what impact his sudden departure would have on what will be his final major budget negotiation. But some Democrats -- who fear Boehner's replacement will cower to demands from the right not to cut a deal -- said they hope Boehner will wrap up all the remaining issues before retiring. 

""I would hope that Boehner would make it easier on the people who are going to follow him,"" Reid said. ""Get it all done before he leaves."" 

In an interview on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday, Boehner suggested he may want to do just that. 

""I don't want to leave my successor a dirty barn. I want to clean the barn up a little bit before the next person gets there,"" Boehner said. 

McConnell said he had ""no earthly idea"" how much work would be completed before Boehner leaves. 

""We are going to have to deal with all of these issues between now and December 11,"" McConnell said. ""How much of that could come together before Speaker Boehner leaves, I have no earthly idea."" 

At issue in the negotiations is how much to spend on the government operations. 

Many Republicans want to break existing budget caps to increase spending for defense while most Democrats want to break the caps to increase funding for domestic programs. But the conservatives in the House who helped force Boehner's exit say they want to rein in government spending and don't want to break the caps at all. 

McConnell said one of his biggest priorities in the talks will be to set a top line spending figure for this year and 2016, which would allow Congress to carry out a normal appropriations process next year. Washington has run on ""continuing resolutions"" for some time, which don't allow Congress to make changes to the way money is spent or to alter policies within government agencies. 

""Let us at least be honest. With a continuing resolution, no waste will be cut. No spending will be cut. No regulations will be stopped. And the debt will continue to mount,"" Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said in a floor speech explaining why he would vote against the continuing resolution.",533e7b29-68ad-4656-b297-cb344fb2bcc0,News,2015-09-30T15:31:56Z,WCYB-TV,Senate OKs bill to fund government until Dec. 11,0.0,News

1966,"by Danny Haiphong The author endorses former Panther leader Elaine Brown’s critique of the movie, However, Blacks Against Empire, the acclaimed book on the Party, meets his approval as “actual historical analysis that is useful for those seeking lessons from the lived struggle of the Panthers.” In Defense of the Panthers: Why the Film “The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution” Should be Put Down, and the book “Black Against Empire” Picked Up by Danny Haiphong “It is critical that we to study the history and politics of the Black Panther Party and derive lessons from their struggle.” The Black Panther Party is one of the most demonized organizations in US history. White supremacists, corporate media tools, and ruling class parasites of all stripes have attempted to soil its legacy since it declined along with the entire radical political movement of the mid 1970’s. The overtly racist critics have called the Black Panther Party gangsters and a Black version of the Ku Klux Klan. These are relatively simple narratives to dispel given the wealth of historical material on the politics and programs of the Black Panther Party. What is harder to address, but just as important to condemn, are the supposedly honest interpreters of the Black Panther Party who debase its history despite claims of doing the opposite. Meet Stanley Nelson’s new documentary The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution. In nearly two hours, Nelson displays a montage of interviews and video clips that effectively depict the Black Panther Party as a non-ideological, disorganized, and infantile group. There is ZERO mention of the Black Panther Party’s revolutionary, socialist orientation. No historical context is given on why or how the Black Panther party formed, or what activities and actions helped grow the organization. Eldridge Cleaver is elevated to superstar status in the film, while Huey Newton is portrayed as a gangster whose best days were spent behind prison walls. Even worse, Nelson brings on former Panther members and historians who outright smear the Party’s legacy. One historian claims in the film that the Panthers “repudiated” the armed struggle in place of their survival programs. In actuality, the Black Panther Party was disarmed by the state through the California legislature’s passage of the Mulford Act, which banned the open carry of firearms. The act was specifically created to weaken the Black Panther Party’s influence in the Black community. Survival programs thus represented a logical transition in the Party’s political work. What the film mentions only briefly is how the Panthers maintained armed self-defense when it came to raids on their offices, programs, and residences. More absurdly, the film completely erases how survival programs, which included not only the free breakfast program but also liberation schools, health clinics, and ambulatory services, were adopted under the principle of “survival pending revolution.” The Black Panther Party saw the poor Black community as a revolutionary class. Survival programs were formed as a means to relate to the struggle of poor Black Americans and at the same time give the party an opportunity to develop the revolutionary consciousness of the masses. Of course, the truth does not matter to a film maker intent on debasing the Black Panther Party. Nelson’s documentary makes so many errors that it is difficult to focus on just one. Elaine Brown’s critique of the film condenses some of the more critical offenses. For one, the film glorifies the erratic Eldridge Cleaver and demonizes Huey P. Newton. Newton was a founder of the Party and his leadership was critical to its growth. In the response to the North Richmond police murder of 22 year-old Denzell Dowell, Newton helped organize the small Oakland chapter to take up an independent investigation of the murder in conjunction with their regular police patrols. The Panthers became adored in North Richmond, as evidenced by the arms they brandished during a Panther-led rally for Dowell. The rally drew national attention and requests for Black Panther chapters elsewhere in the country began to mount. This is just one way Newton was instrumental in the organization’s success throughout its existence. “Survival programs represented a logical transition in the Party’s political work.” It should be of no surprise that a film so intent on demonizing one of most important ideological and political leaders of the Black Panther Party omitted the context that indeed made the organization the vanguard of the period. Nelson’s highlight reel not only misses the context that gave rise Black Panther Party, it contains more than one historical distortion. No mention was made of COINTELPRO’s role in fueling the split of the Oakland and New York chapters through a forged letter sent to Huey Newton informing him of a future assassination attempt on his body by the east coast branch. Bobby Hutton’s murder was chalked up to his desire to “shoot em up” when in reality it was the Oakland police, and possibly Cleaver’s misleadership, who murdered him in cold blood.  And finally, another historian makes the claim that independence movements in Vietnam, China, and Algeria were logically attracted to the Black Panthers Party’s “Anti-Americanism.” Such a racist simplification erases the heroic struggle against imperialism waged by these national liberation struggles and strips the Black Panther Party of their active and independent efforts to forge internationalist solidarity with them. Luckily for us, there is a secondary account of the Black Panther Party that paints a more accurate picture of the organization’s history and politics. Black Against Empire: A History and Politics of the Black Panther Party uses interviews with members and archived Panther newspapers to present a narrative of the Party’s rise and fall. In it, one can find entire chapters dedicated to the historical context that gave rise to the Party, as well as the conditions and efforts that led them to choose Marxist thought as their guide. Rather than tokenize Fred Hampton’s assassination as the single expression of the FBI’s desire to “prevent the rise of a Black Messiah”, Black Against Empireexplicitly shows that the US government indeed viewed the Party as a “threat to the internal security of the nation” and employed a multifaceted war against them. The authors of Black Against Empire rightfully take the war on the Panthers seriously and explore the impact the repression on the Party’s growth and fall. Repression had the effect of publicizing the Black Panther Party in a way that drew supporters of a growing anti-establishment movement that made the connection between the US government’s war in Vietnam and its war on Black America. This brought political and financial support to the Party’s survival programs. The Panther’s organizational response to repression was action. They rallied the anti-war movement at home and built relationships with the anti-imperialist struggle abroad. At their height, the Black Panther Party had chapters in dozens of countries including Algeria, Japan, and numerous European nations. But perhaps the most important contribution of Black Against Empire is its examination of the Black Panther Party’s decline. Rather than mimic Nelson’s racist attacks on Huey Newton, Black Against Empire offers an actual historical analysis that is useful for those seeking lessons from the lived struggle of the Panthers. The book concludes that a shift in social conditions withdrew public support and isolated its revolutionary approach. The Vietnam War eventually ended and so did the draft. Additionally, US imperialism renewed diplomatic relations with many of the Panther’s international allies. And a Black misleadership class was created to isolate the Black Panther Party’s politics in the Black community. Changing social conditions only exacerbated the impact of the splinters and divides created by the US government’s war on the Panthers. These developments paved a difficult terrain from which to operate, forcing most chapters to close by the latter half of the 1970. A sober analysis of the Black Panther Party is impossible without the exploration of the social conditions that fueled its growth and decline. It is even less possible to understand the true character of the Black Panther Party without knowledge of the historical context of their politics. Not only does the documentary The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolutionfail to meet both requirements, but also it simultaneously forwards the same racist, anticommunist filth that has dominated narratives of the Panthers since their decline. The film concludes that the Party’s demise happened in part through Newton’s connections to the “underground scene” and “former prisoners.”  This heinous demonization of the Black Panther Party falls in line with the entire film. Rather than acknowledge that working class Black Americans and prisoners were the foundation and life of the Party, the film paints the Black Panther Party as a childish group of gangsters who merely had some interesting moments. Such a characterization could be nothing further from the truth.Black Against Empire and the numerous primary works created by former Panthers, some of whom remain political prisons to this day, provide ample evidence of the Black Panther Party’s revolutionary legacy. One can read Black Against Empire, Huey Netwon’s Autobiography, or Elaine Brown’s A Taste of Power for a critical history and analysis on the formation of the Black Panther Party. Newton’s doctoral dissertation War on the Panthers gives all the information one needs to know about the extent and significance of the US government’s war on the Black Panther Party. And these just skim the surfaces of the works available for those interested in a true education on the Black Panther Party. It is critical that we to study the history and politics of the Black Panther Party and derive lessons from their struggle. Political education is a revolutionary act. US imperialism cannot maintain its parasitic existence from sheer exploitation alone. The state, and all of its connections to the mass media, is the force from which the ruling class manages resistance to imperial rule.  This includes the physical repression levied from the police, military, and the courts as well as the psychological repression experienced through schools and media institutions. The Black Panther Party has received massive levels of both forms of repression precisely because of the threat they posed to the state and the imperialist system as a whole. But you wouldn’t know this from watching Stanley Nelson’s documentary. It is essential for those who claim to be in the movement against capitalism and white supremacy to study and learn from those who came before us. We can start by putting down Nelson’s documentary and picking up Black Against Empire and the work that inspired it. source: http://blackagendareport.com/in_defense_of_panthers",d5b7d3ce-9c8c-4817-a8ac-c00d2236584d,Blog,2015-09-23T20:57:52Z,Moorbey'z Blog,"In Defense of the Pantherz: Why the Film ""The Black Pantherz: Vanguard of the Revolution"" Should be Put Down, and the book ""Black Against Empire"" Picked Up",1.0,Blog

If you haven’t seen the trailer for Amy yet, go watch it now. The recent documentary from director Asif Kapadia is a haunting sketch of the life of Amy Winehouse that revives her music for new fans, and gives former fans the second dose of Winehouse they had all been waiting for. 
 
The film traces the artist’s rise and fall from her teenage beginnings as a jazz club frequenter, to her international fame with the Grammy Award-winning Back to Black , and finally to her tragic overdose at the age of 27. 
 
With footage from home videos, television and radio interviews, and heartbreaking post-mortem interviews with her closest friends and relatives, the film gives an explicit glance into the tragic and not so uncommon life of a high-profile celebrity. 
 
As a longtime Amy Winehouse fan, I was unsure of what to expect from the film. My interest in her was mostly confined to her music, and I knew little about her life aside from her public battle with addiction and her death five years ago. 
 
While her music has clear reference to her struggles with mental illness, broken relationships and drug use, a clear portrait of her experiences has never before been available to the public. This glimpse into her life gives a new meaning to her lyrics that makes her music even more powerful than it was to begin with. 
 
Amy Winehouse grew up in London, England, where she started her career as a jazz singer. She lived in a middle-class home with a set of friends that would stick around until her last days. Her story does not sound uncommon or tragic when first told, but as she aged, fell into depression, became reliant on drugs and alcohol, and lived a life exploited by the public, a great talent grew smaller. 
 
A powerful aspect of the movie is its ability to couple Winehouse’s experiences with the corresponding music she wrote in those moments. The film will go into detail about a part of her life, such as the on-again off-again relationship with her eventual husband Blake, and follow the scene with a live recording of the song reflecting this time in her life. The documentary does a beautiful job at highlighting lyrics with elegant script up against record studio footage and scribbled poetry in notebooks. 
 
One of the most tragic parts of the film comes when hearing from her parents. They both noticed her depressive behavior, but shrugged it off as a passing phase as opposed to addressing it. Her mother was made aware of her daughter’s lifelong struggle with Bulimia when she was a teenager, but didn’t see anything wrong with the behavior until much later in her life. Her father acknowledges that his absence from home and the affair that kept him away from his family led to her early substance abuse, yet he never made an effort to get her help until it was too late. 
 
Seeing how the people closest to her reacted to her struggles was devastating. It all made her death seem inevetable rather than preventable. 
 
It would have been nice to see more about her early musical influences rather than just elements of her personal life, but the film does touch upon her young love of jazz and its influence on her first recordings. 
 
Previous fans as well as those unfamiliar with her music and story can enjoy the film. It is a well-made documentary that does a lot with found footage and conveys a tragic yet compelling story that any music fan would appreciate.

724,"Firefly and Serenity alumni Alan Tudyk who was announced as a member of the Star Wars Anthology: Rogue One cast has revealed that he nearly turned down the role. 
 
Tudyk revealed to Digital Spy that a filming clash with his crowd-funded web series Con Man almost meant that he would be forced to turn down director Gareth Edwards's offer, recalling ""[Gareth] offered it to me in the room - it didn't seem real, I said, 'I would love to say yes, but it is contingent on one thing. I can't believe I'm saying this, but if you're shooting in June, I have to say no' - because that's when we were shooting Con Man, and I couldn't figure out how to reschedule it."" 
 
However the stars aligned when Edwards told him he wouldn't be needed on the film's Pinewood Studios set, and whilst Tudyk didn’t divulge any plot spoilers, he did reveal that the majority of his scenes are with Diego Luna and Felicity Jones and added ""It's more fun on a movie set than I've had in a very long time, ""I didn't know what to expect. I really like my fellow cast-members - Diego Luna and Felicity Jones, I see them a lot, most of my scenes are with them. And Gareth is great. 
 

 
There's always those days that are really hard. You're wet, you're cold, it's way early... there's some interesting things when you're on-set that can be challenging. 
 
But when you get into that moment of, 'This is hard, this is terrible, I'm miserable' and then you're like, 'Oh look, it's Star Wars!' and that feeling is immediately erased. It doesn't last for a breath - you can't even get it out without going, 'But look over there! And look at that!'""

3716,"During his visit in Ghana today, President Buhari said he has so far declared his assets four times, for the four different times he has had cause to serve Nigeria in various capacities.
“I recall that in 1975 when late Murtala Mohammed became the Head of State, we were lined up - governors, ministers, members of the Supreme Military Council. Officials of Ministry of Justice were brought and every individual was made to declare his assets. All Heads of States and Government, governors, ministers, permanent secretaries have to declare their assets because it is a constitutional requirement.
I have declared my assets four times. When I was governor in 1975, I declared. After being Minister of Petroleum and as a member of Supreme Military Council, I declared.

One of our family's favorite ways to connect is to share a travel adventure.

We stopped over in England to raise a glass with Cousin Nancy at The Eagle and Child, a favorite hangout of J.R.R. Tolkien.

Then on to Romania...

...Hungary...

...and Slovakia.

It was like stepping back in time.

In some places horse-drawn carts and hay wagons were almost as common as automobiles.

Travelers shared the road, no matter what their mode of conveyance.

During haying time in Romania...

...everyone seemed to be out working in the fields with their wooden rakes and hayforks.

Grandma and Grandpa too. 
While shepherds watched over their sheep, as they have done since time out of mind.

We visited beautiful villages...

...and cities.

We saw the ancient painted churches of Bucovina, designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

We tried some new things...

...met some new friends...

...and made memories which we shall enjoy for the rest of our lives.

It's thrilling to go out into the world, but just as wonderful to come home again.

We found a treasure or two on our travels, but the best souvenirs...

...are always the new friendships, insights, and perspectives we carry home with us.

1194,"SANTA CLARA, Calif. -  The West Coast Conference announced its preseason golf polls on Wednesday, and Santa Clara University had three student-athletes named among the league's best.  

On the women's side, junior Annie Freman (pictured) - the WCC's Freshman of the Year and All-WCC First Team honoree in 2014 - was named to the All-WCC Preseason Women's Golf Team . The Broncos finished third in the five-team league last spring at the championship tournament.   

Senior Carlos Briones (pictured) and sophomore Hayden Shieh earned spots on the  All-WCC Preseason Men's Golf Team . Both are local products from the Bay Area, who are in the midst of outstanding amateur careers. Shieh was the top young player in the WCC a year ago, winning the 2015 WCC Freshman of the Year award.

1952,"Pregnancy: Weeks 21-24 12 Sep It’s been another month! Let’s take a look at how my pregnancy’s going. Here are my previous updates: weeks 1-7, weeks 8-12, weeks 13-16, and weeks 17-20. We’ll start with a bump pic… Weight Gained: By 20 weeks I gained 11 lbs total. Wk 21= +0 lbs, Wk 22= +2 lbs, Wk 23= +1 lb, Wk 24= +0 lb. So by week 24 I gained 14 lbs total. Symptoms: I tend to over heat more easily. I’ve noticed I get much sweatier than normal in body pump. TMI- I also get constipated regularly and only poop (hey, everyone does it!) every few days. For me, that’s out of the norm. I was a regular once-a-day-er, haha. My feet and belly seem to be more swollen/bigger by the end of the day. Nothing crazy or uncomfortable, just noticeable. Food Cravings/Aversions: Again this update, nothing out of the ordinary. I’ve been keeping an eye on my sugars and only indulging once a week (although I tend to over indulge), and that doesn’t even include froyo/soft serve ;) Good news though, I passed my glucose test! I’ve been eating a lot of nut butters and nuts in general. I tend to keep dipping the spoon in the jar or my hand in the container. Misc: I bought some new workout clothes that fit better. I never liked tight tops when running, but now I’m all about them to show off my bump!  My mom got me some work pants that I really like. I won this Mud Love bracelet from Carlee’s Blog. I got to pick which word I wanted off a list and I went with “family” because a) family is everything b) my family is always there for me and c) I’m starting my own family. All good things to remember and think about throughout the day. Workouts: Took things easy after my big race last Sunday ;) J/K, it was only a 5k. This week was the same as most. I’m just happy to be able to run still <3 Mon– Rest
Tues– 1 m walk on tread/ Body Pump

Fri– 4m on tread @ 9:15 pace

Sun– 1 hr on the Elliptical This bruise from the glucose test was especially fun to show off at body pump. My veins are full and plump, but small, so I almost always bruise after giving blood. It was really fun when I had to give blood every few days for a month for the IUI. Hopefully people don’t think I’m doing drugs while pregnant, haha. I doubt they do. I’m sure it’ll look good on the elliptical on Sunday, too when my arm stretches out holding the handles (or whatever they’re called.) Linking up with Erin for my weekend snapshot.

The deployment of the solution enables TM to have a singular, reconciled view of the entire network, providing a connected visual topology of the core fibre and distribution networks, associated services and customers as a single trustworthy source.   

Benedict Enweani, Ontology CEO commented: "" We are excited to  empower TM  in  realis ing its  1 - NetView   to enable a single view of its entire network system.  1-NetV iew is a visionary and ambitious project. It would be the pride of any operator, and we are deeply grateful to TM for giving us the opportunity to deliver a foundation  tool .  TM ' s empowering ethos has made it possible to innovate on a grand scale. Our corporate priority is now to invest in Malaysia as an ASEAN centre of excellence. "" 

"" We are indeed very happy to see that  1 - NetView is already gaining traction across wider user groups within  TM and ultimatel y it  will  enable TM ' s end customers to  experience the benefit of this empowering capability first hand. The innovative system enables rapid determination of fault impacts, simplification of lengthy process and faster correction of conflicting infrastructure data which negatively impacts both operations efficiency and customer satisfaction , ""   Benedict added.   

Giorgio Migliarina, TM Chief Technology and Innovation Officer commented: "" Our choice of Ontology for 1-NetView was based on the insight that joining up our many sources of network and customer data to obtain a trustworth y, dynamic, end-to-end topology would require innovative technology and a fresh approach. "" 

"" Ontology ' s graph-data and semantic modelling technology provides the flexibility needed  to deal with our wide range of data sources. It also enables a disciplined, agile approach to solution delivery with weekly progress that includes and enthuses end-users and management. The implementation of 1-NetView will enable us to improve our operational efficiencies  by the simplification of processes in provisioning and customer care , thus enhancing customers ' overall experience with our services . This is in line with our aspirations of 'Making Life and Business Easier' for our customers , "" Giorgio elaborated.   

The second phase only took 12 weeks to incorporate the distribution network. It builds on the 8 week initial deployment of 1-Netview, which enabled fibre core service impact analysis for enterprise customers and services. It is worth noting that both phases were delivered on-time and on-budget through the collaboration. 

A final phase of the project, to incorporate access network technologies and services, is now underway. This will complete the end-to-end (E2E) coverage of the solution and is scheduled to complete well before year end.

1559,"It seems every Republican you talk to or hear from is a Biblical scholar. Just about every letter you read in the newspaper is about someone’s religious beliefs or how sinful it is for women who become pregnant through rape or incest to abort. 
 
If you believe, as do Franklin Graham, Mike Huckabee and Pat Robertson, everything is an act of God or God’s will, why aren’t you angry about God aborting his own creations via miscarriages? 
 
As a Christian who doesn’t force anyone to share my beliefs or values, I can hardly believe God would be so careless with his creations as to create people attracted to the same sex and capable of loving one another. According to the Bible, the Lord came to Jeremiah saying: “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you.” 
 
If these are the words of God, why would he create someone attracted to the same sex knowing they would be living in sin? 
 
God gave us a free will. We are not programmed robots. Our strength does not come from within us, our strength comes from God through prayer. 
 
What may be right to you may be wrong to someone else. 
 
Forget about putting Christ back in Christmas. The right-wing Christians need to put Christ back in Christianity.

2113,"Football Association board member Heather Rabbatts has expressed her ""sadness and anger"" at news of Chelsea team doctor Eva Carneiro's departure from the club. 
 
Carneiro is understood to have parted company with Chelsea following the incident on the opening day of the season when she was criticised by manager Jose Mourinho. It is understood likely that she will launch a claim for constructive dismissal. 
 
Rabbatts said Carneiro had been subjected to verbal abuse and criticism after running on to the pitch to treat Eden Hazard - Chelsea were then temporarily reduced to nine  men against Swansea as Hazard had to leave the field. 
 
""News of Dr Eva Carneiro's departure from Chelsea FC makes me feel sadness and anger,"" said Rabbatts, who is chair of the FA's inclusion advisory board. 
 
""Eva was one of the few very senior women in the game, a highly respected doctor who has acted with professional integrity in difficult circumstances and whose skills have been highly praised by her colleagues, the club and governing bodies."" 
 
Carneiro has not been at Chelsea's Cobham training ground since she was removed from first team duties on August 8. Rabbatts said she had been effectively demoted for doing her job properly. 
 
A Chelsea spokesman said he could not comment on internal staffing matters. 
 
Rabbatts added: ""On the 8th August Eva fulfilled her duty as the senior medic and responded to the referee to enter the field of play to treat a player. Any other response would have been a dereliction of her duty and a breach of GMC guidelines as confirmed recently by the organisation of Premier League doctors. 
 
""In acting properly she was then subject to verbal abuse and public criticism and in effect demoted by her removal from the bench. 
   Promoted stories   
""Her departure raises a serious question on how players are safeguarded if their medical support is compromised."" 
 
Carneiro was also the victim of sexist abuse from opposing fans last season. The FA is still investigating a complaint from a member of the public that Mourinho used sexist language towards her after the incident on August 8 - he denies doing so. 
 
Rabbatts added: ""In addition, as chair of the Inclusion Advisory Board, I have a responsibility to support women in the game and Eva has been a role model for many girls and women who aspire to work in football. Her treatment sends all the wrong messages. 
 
""The footage of the abuse she has endured in silence from the stands during her career is something we should all be ashamed of. 
 
""Being passionate about the game is also about standing up against abusive chanting, bullying and insults to a fellow professional. 
 
""As a member of the board of the FA, I can make no comment on the FA investigation currently under way and this is rightly a matter for the regulation team. 
 
""However, I believe that all those who have an interest in these issues and who have a duty to safeguard relevant policies and procedures raise their voice in support of Eva and question how she has been treated. 
 
""I hope that Eva's own situation can be resolved quickly and positively, that she will be able to continue to work in a senior position within the game and that steps are taken to ensure that professional integrity is protected and women are properly encouraged to be a part of our national game, including at elite level."" 
 
The issue of team doctors has been discussed by the FIFA medical committee as a result of the incident. 
 
Earlier this month, FA chief executive Martin Glenn said: ""We work to a FIFA mandate on medical support. The duty of the doctor is to the player, not the employer. It is the Hippocratic oath. 
 
""It is an issue for Chelsea to sort out but I don't believe they are playing a dangerous game."" 
 
Minutes after the final whistle of the opening-day game, Mourinho explained why he  was upset with Carneiro and head physiotherapist Jon Fearn. 
 
He said : ""I was unhappy with my medical staff. They were impulsive and naive. 
 
""Whether you are a kit man, doctor or secretary on the bench you have to  understand the game. 
 
""You have to know you have one player less and to assist a player you must be  sure he has a serious problem. I was sure Eden did not have a serious problem.  He had a knock. He was tired."" 
 
The Football Association has received a complaint against the Chelsea boss, it was confirmed last week. 
 
Prior investigation into the incident in question has shown Mourinho is  likely to avoid a reprimand from the FA, unless new evidence comes to light. 
   
 Share article  
   
Mourinho is thought to  have said ""filho da puta"", which translates as ""son of a bitch"", on the  touchline in footage which was swiftly uploaded to the internet.  It is understood the complaint received by the FA claims Mourinho said ""filha  da puta"", which translates as ""daughter of a whore"". 
 
The complainant was implying Mourinho was referring to Carneiro directly after  she followed Fearn on to the field to treat Hazard, but the comment has  already been examined.",bf50e97c-1e22-448d-abbb-9a6c5c0b72f2,News,2015-09-22T17:59:14Z,This is the West Country,Eva Carneiro leaves Chelsea - to FA board member's dismay,0.0,News

1993,"“ Not invented here ” is never a very nice attitude to come across in business. The idea that something is better just because it has been worked on and tweaked by a company’s own staff is at best arrogant and, at worst, means the company will miss countless opportunities to produce better products or do so more cost effectively. 
 
Bringing in third-party vendors – anything from a single contractor to a team from a big multinational – will bring fresh ideas and often fresh impetus to a project. But there is also risk involved too. 
 
Corporate compliance teams – whose job it is to ensure the business is managing that risk – are typically bought into help evaluate of third-party vendors after they’ve been selected. It’s much better for all concerned if the compliance teams is in on the process from the beginning. 
 
As the global compliance counsel at a global manufacturer in CEB’s compliance membership recently said, “If you’re only getting involved at the last step, when the business has already decided to bring on a third party, you’re managing the process but you’re not managing the risk” (see chart 1). 
 

 
Chart 1: Ability to control risk decreases throughout the procurement process   Risk variability among prospective third parties, illustrative  Source: CEB analysis 
 
That’s why the compliance team takes a role early on in the procurement process. Compliance can exert greater influence when there are more third party options to consider and has a better chance to proactively affect the level of risk the business is willing to accept. 
 Two Ways Compliance Can Help with Choosing the Right Third-Party Vendor  
This approach has helped line managers at the large manufacturer select third parties with the best risk-reward tradeoffs and also help shape demand for compliance services. It has two main components. 
   
Help business partners question their assumptions : First, the compliance team challenges ingrained assumptions that line managers may have about who might be the best external candidates for a particular project (see chart 2). 
 

 
Chart 2: Assumptions line managers make about using third-party vendors  Source: CEB analysis 
 
The compliance team doesn’t add any layers of bureaucracy; it simply asks these questions at its regular meetings with regional business partners. This helps the compliance team gather intelligence about the potential third party relationships required to achieve a given business goal while there is still an opportunity to meaningfully alter the level of risk associated with a project. 
   
Make compliance costs transparent : Second, the compliance team prices out the amount of compliance-related costs associated with a particular third party. While most compliance teams assume that line managers won’t care about this kind of information, providing a more accurate cost-benefit analysis that includes compliance costs will show the value of the expertise that the compliance team can provide. 
 
Once business partners see this, they will become increasingly receptive to any perspectives from the compliance team in future discussions (see chart 3).

This two-pronged approach helps line managers select the third-party vendors with the right level of risk and reward, while ensuring their work will support the firm’s business goals.

294,"Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that Congress should repeal the unpopular ""Cadillac tax,"" an Obamacare tariff on premium health care plans. 
 
The tax is set to go into effect in 2018. 

Clinton said that while the Affordable Care Act -- one of President Barack Obama's top legislative achievements -- was ""working, plain and simple,"" there were some changes that needed to be made. 

""I have proposed new reforms to build on the progress we've made and lower out-of-pocket costs for families,"" said Clinton in a statement. ""That's why, among other steps, I encourage Congress to repeal the so-called Cadillac tax, which applies to some employer-based health plans, and to fully pay for the cost of repeal."" 

Clinton said some of her proposed reforms to Obamacare, which she has rolled out in the past month, would more than cover the cost of repealing the Cadillac tax, a measure that helped to pay for the health care reform law. 

Clinton's campaign first said the candidate disapproved of the Cadillac tax during a call earlier this month with the American Federation of Teachers, a powerful union that has endorsed Clinton. 

The call was first reported Tuesday by The New York Times. Shortly after the story was published, Clinton's campaign released a statement calling on Congress to repeal the tax. 

Union members, many of whom enjoy the generous employer-based coverage plans, would be hit by the 40% tax, which applies to plans with yearly premiums exceeding $10,200 for individuals and $27,500 for families. 

Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers and a longtime Clinton supporter, praised the former secretary of state's decision. 

""We are proud that Hillary Clinton has come out in favor of a repeal of the so-called Cadillac tax -- a harmful tax on health benefits that is hurting America's working families,"" she said. ""This tax already is being used by employers to shift an increasing share of health care costs to employees."" 

But many health care experts who view the tax as a crucial part of the Obamacare law are critical of Clinton's position. 

""The smarter move is to leave well enough alone and allow this tax to take effect,"" said Jared Bernstein, a former White House economist and senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in a Washington Post op-ed earlier this year. ""After decades of fighting for it, we're finally moving towards a more rational, efficient health care system. Let's not screw that up.""",bd0a0113-608c-4b84-9963-a7627fa9bea2,News,2015-09-30T04:13:39Z,16 WAPT,Clinton: End Obamacare tax on top health plans,0.0,Blog
5493,"MAMER MOTORSPORTS TAKES ON CARNAGE AT INAGURAL LOORRS BAJA RACE ROUNDS 11&12 
Cole Mamer and his team were prepared as they could be as they went south of the American border and pulled into the new Lucas Oil Off Road Race Series course at Estero Beach. The new course was located just miles outside of Ensenada, Baja California. 
 
LOORRS added in the new race course to this season race schedule and as many teams were nervous about taking the series to a new stop, Mamer Motorsports was excited for the change of pace, new fans and a new course to race the #35 Mamer Motorsports Pro-Lite on. 
 
It wasn’t long before the trucks were on the course running down four practices just in one day. The course provided the drivers with nearly a mile long of door to door opportunities to attempt a pass. The key to this course was to stay out of the dust, keep clean through the turns and keep on the gas you went through the rhythm section. 
 

When race day came Saturday, fans were lined at the gate waiting in anticipation to see a new form of off-road racing that hasn’t been to Baja since 2002. The thrill of meeting new drivers, seeing crews work on the trucks and witnessing first hand the carnage that can go into short course racing had the fans on their feet all day. 
 
The Pro-Lite race was the second race of the day and Mamer had to line up at the back of the stacked class after qualifying didn’t go his way. This didn’t stop Mamer though as that green flag dropped he immediately made 3 passes right out of turn one. When a wreck on the first lap brought out a full course yellow the trucks had to restart the race and Mamer had to go back to his original starting position. 
 
The 15 trucks took on the restart and once again Mamer went for multiple passes and pulled it off, this time passing 4 trucks on the restart lap. This was great momentum for Mamer as he let the race come to him. 
 

A dusty course didn’t distract the driver as he battled with Creed looking to take over the 6th place position. The 10 lap race was ticking down and once Creed crashed it moved Mamer up to that 6th place. He was on the tail of DeBerti as they were coming through the rhythm section when he found himself and DeBerti both getting sideways and with a quick reaction Mamer steered out of the way as DeBerti was spinning through the air and wrecking. 
 
Even though Mamer managed to avoid a major accident, his truck didn’t make it out alive as he fell to the back of the pack with broken front end of the truck. Mamer pushed through the rest of the race with a limp truck in 10th, but still was able to salvage some points. 
 

Mamer rounded out the weekend with a 9th place finish in round 12 and will be heading to Reno, NV for rounds 13&14 sitting 10th in points. Reno will provide the racers with many elevation changes, high speed sections and one last chance to really fight for a higher points standing before they head into the final stretch of the season.

2201,"For years, dating to the latter stages of the Bowl Championship Series through the start of the College Football Playoff, teams in the Pac-12 Conference have pointed to a unique argument when plugging the league’s postseason case: Unlike the rest of the Power Five landscape, we play nine conference games and a championship game.The argument remains unique. It simply holds less water after an opening-weekend performance that can only be termed a disaster for a Pac-12 pegged as one of the top two conferences in the Football Bowl Subdivision.Utah and UCLA have beaten non-conference Power Five opponents, Michigan and Virginia, that are trying to resurrect their programs, but their good work was undermined Saturday.The league lost two games against teams from the Mountain West Conference: Washington fell at Boise State, and Colorado did the same at Hawaii. Washington’s in the midst of a rebuilding project, while Boise State stands as the strongest team on the Group of Five level. Colorado’s loss is a poor omen for the Buffaloes’ own quest for respectability.Stanford was barely recognizable against Northwestern, managing just two field goals against a team with just six wins in its last 20 games. Those waiting for the Cardinal’s eventual offensive breakthrough should reconsider their optimism; Stanford clearly took nothing from last season’s late shift toward an up-tempo slant.

2850,"(September 02, 2015) CALGARY, Alberta, Sept. 2, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --Pembina Pipeline Corporation (""Pembina"" or ""the Company"") (TSX: PPL; NYSE: PBA) is pleased to announce that it has commissioned several key growth projects within its Gas Services and Conventional Pipeline businesses, placing approximately $650 million assets into service. Additionally, Pembina is providing an update on other key growth projects on-going across its business.

""I am proud of the work Pembina employees have done to commission such large scale energy infrastructure projects,"" said Mick Dilger, Pembina's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""I am also very pleased to advise that a large portion of these projects were placed into service on-time and under budget. Further, and most importantly, was the exemplary safety record that was maintained across all of these projects from construction through to commissioning.""

Gas Services Pembina's Gas Services business successfully commissioned 260 million cubic feet per day (""MMcf/d"") of new processing capacity and pipeline infrastructure in Alberta and Saskatchewan for a combined capital investment of approximately $320 million, which represents a seven percent savings versus the original project budget. 

In late August, Pembina safely commissioned its Saturn II facility, a 200 MMcf/d 'twin' of the Company's existing Saturn I Facility (""Saturn II""),ahead of schedule and under budget. Saturn II is an example of recognizing value achieved through leveraging an existing 'Pembina template' design, which supported the successful and safe execution of this project. Further demonstrating the benefits of the Company's integrated service offering, the natural gas liquids (""NGL"") volumes produced at Saturn II will also be transported on Pembina's Peace Pipeline system and will be fractionated at Pembina's Redwater facility. 

Pembina's Saskatchewan Ethane Extraction plant (""SEEP"") was commissioned in late August. SEEP was acquired as part of the Vantage Pipeline acquisition which closed in October of 2014. This facility has a deep cut processing capacity of 60 MMcf/d and ethane plus fractionation capabilities which supports up to approximately 4,500 barrels per day (""bpd"") of ethane extraction. The ethane volumes produced at SEEP will be transported under a long-term, fee-for-service agreement on Pembina's Vantage Pipeline. This project was successfully and safely completed on-time and under budget. 

Additionally, Pembina placed into service the gathering pipeline associated with the 100 MMcf/d Resthaven Expansion project (the ""Resthaven Expansion""). This project consists of a 12 inch diameter 28 kilometer pipeline with capacity to deliver 100 MMcf/d that will connect a customer's condensate recovery plant into Pembina's Resthaven facility. In advance of the expected in-service of the Resthaven Expansion, this newly commissioned pipeline will be able to provide additional gas volumes for Pembina's existing Resthaven facility. Construction of the Resthaven Expansion is underway and is expected be in-service by mid-2016. Once the Resthaven Expansion is complete, the facility's gross gas processing capacity will increase to 300 MMcf/d.

With the Saturn II and SEEP facilities in-service, Pembina's Gas Services capacity has increased 26 percent from 1,003 MMcf/d to 1,263 MMcf/d. ""This additional capacity supports Pembina in becoming one of Canada's largest third party gas processors,"" said Jaret Sprott, Pembina's Vice President, Gas Services. ""These plants provide increased exposure to attractive Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin multi-zone geology and represents Pembina's entry into Saskatchewan's prolific Bakken resource play."" 

Conventional Pipelines 

At the beginning of September, Pembina commissioned the high vapour pressure (""HVP""), or NGL, portion of the Peace and Northern Phase II pipeline expansion (""Phase II HVP""), and expects to have the pipeline fully commissioned by the end of 2015. In conjunction with the low vapour pressure (""LVP""), or crude oil and condensate portion of the expansion that was placed into service in April of this year (""Phase II LVP""), the Peace and Northern Phase II pipeline expansion (the ""Phase II Expansion"") is now in-service. In aggregate, the Phase II Expansion and all associated laterals represents an approximately $670 million of capital investment, of which approximately $330 million is attributable to the Phase II HVP project and approximately $340 million is attributable to the Phase II LVP project. The Phase II Expansion is underpinned by 5 to 10 year contracts with substantial take-or-pay commitments from approximately 40 customers. The Phase II Expansion is expected to increase Peace and Northern systems' capacity by 108,000 bpd in aggregate. As a result of commissioning the Phase II Expansion, total capacity in Pembina's Conventional Pipeline business will increase by 15 percent to approximately 830,000 bpd. ""These expansions provide much needed hydrocarbon liquids transportation capacity for the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin,"" said Jason Wiun, Pembina's Vice President, Conventional Pipelines. ""Pembina is well positioned to support future production growth through our existing asset base and through our committed growth projects that have significant embedded expansion potential.""

""With the commissioning of Phase II Expansion, including the LVP portion placed into service in April, and the approximately $320 million of new Gas Service's assets, this represents approximately $1 billion of new fee-for-service supported infrastructure,"" said Scott Burrows, Pembina's Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer.""This large scale investment helps to continue to grow Pembina's low risk fee-for-service asset base and demonstrates the value associated with Pembina's sector leading secured growth portfolio.""

Project Updates

In the coming months, Pembina will be commissioning a number of projects in its NGL Midstream business. Early in 2016, Pembina plans to commission the twin of its existing 73,000 bpd ethane plus fractionator (""RFS II""). The completion of RFS II will further strengthen Pembina's position as Western Canada's largest owner of fractionation capacity. Additionally, in early 2016, a small scale debottlenecking initiative to modestly increase propane plus throughput capacity at Pembina's existing Redwater Fractionator is expected to be commissioned. Finally, at Pembina's Corunna site, construction and commissioning of new brine pond, storage, rail, and truck infrastructure is well under-way, the new assets are expected to be phased into service through the remainder of 2015 and early 2016.

Pembina would also like to provide an update for the regulatory process associated with the $220 million expansion to pipeline infrastructure in northeast British Columbia (""B.C."") (the ""NEBC Expansion Project""). On August 26th 2015, Pembina withdrew its application for an expedited environmental review by the B.C. Environmental Assessment Office (""B.C. E.A.O""). Pembina's application was withdrawn to ensure that all First Nations and public concerns are identified and fulsomely addressed. Pembina intends to file a project application with the B.C. E.A.O in late 2015 and will be proceeding with preparing an environmental assessment certificate through the B.C. environmental assessment process, both of which will help support the project moving forward successfully. The anticipated schedule for the NEBC Expansion Project remains unchanged with an expected in-service date of Q4 2017, subject to regulatory and environmental approvals.

Brown recently shared that he would be going on tour in December and his announcement sparked a lot of backlash. Australian officials may stop him from entering their country due to the fact that he was convicted of domestic violence. “People need to understand, if you are going to commit domestic violence and you want to travel around the world, there are going to be countries that say to you, ‘You cannot come in because you are not of the character that we expect in Australia’,” said Senator Michaelia Cash , Australia’s Minister for Women.

972,"No, the US is not Japan and the Federal Reserve is not the Bank of Japan. But when we assess the implications of what could be the first Fed rate after 7 years of zero interest rate policy in the US, there's no better reference than the BoJ.
When Japan's asset bubble finally burst in 1990 and the nation was gripped in a deflationary spiral, the BoJ's easing policy took interest rates from 6.0% in 1991 to 0.50% in 1995. The central bank paused for three years as the global economy picked up and US demand powered ahead, until the Asian currency crisis hit the continent, forcing the BoJ to further slash rates, dragging the overnight rate to 0.25% in 1998 and 0% in 1999. Quantitative easing followed in 2001. 1st policy mistake In August 2000, satisfied with a modest recovery in inflation and prompted by the need to respond the global economic rebound as well as a series of Fed tightening, BoJ governor Masaru Hayami (known for his hawkishness and combative decisions against the cabinet) decided to raise rates by 25 bps. That proved to be the first policy error as the fallout from the dotcom bubble and the resulting recession in the US and in most of Europe accelerated Japan's deflationary crisis. Hayami was forced to ease again, slashing rates until they returned to 0.0% in early 2006. 2nd policy mistake. The 2nd and more publicized policy mistake occurred in late Q1 2006 as the BoJ, under governor Toshihiko Fukui, began withdrawing liquidity, which was created by raising excess reserves under the 5-year old quantitative easing policy. There were good reasons for reducing the extent of easing: Japan inflation was at 2-year highs, yen was at 3-year lows, the global economic recovery has entered its 2nd year, Fed had been raising rates for two years and even the European Central Bank had started tightening. But Fukui got carried away as the reduction of QE turned into higher rates. The overnight rate was raised back to 0.25% in July 2006 and to 0.50% in February 2007, then a nine-year high. As the global crisis imploded, the BoJ was forced to join all other central banks, dragging rates back to 0.1%. It may be disingenuous to call the BoJ's 2006 tightening a policy mistake as the dynamics prevailing at the time did justify such action. But the fact that the central bank not only quickly returned to zero rates, but also remained stuck in that phase well after other central banks partly withdrew their easing does highlight the structural deficiencies of Japan's savings/deflation dynamics, which were only worsened by the 2006-7 rate hikes. PM Abe's 2012 decision to go for shock-&-awe policy and currency easing reflects the structural complexities of Japan's savings-deflationary deficiency. And still not much progress, with the exception of a weaker yen. Fed Hike would be another Mistake. Despite notable tightening in the US jobs market and improved state of most US balance sheets, a Fed rate hike today will be a policy mistake. Inflation continues to deviate away from the Fed's 2.0% target, lingering at a four-year low of 1.2%, from 1.4% in March and 1.7% in July 2014. This will be exacerbated by the disinflationary impact of USD strength, while inevitable depreciation of the Chinese yuan will continue to supress US inflation to the extent of shadowing declines in US jobless rate. The liquidity gaps in the US treasury market and the threat of further yields spikes at a time when the Federal government is nearing another debt ceiling deadline implies a potential break in the bond market and a blow for equity valuations, long dependent on low discount rates. Aside from China, Saudi Arabia, a key strategic partner of the US is already suffering from the combination of plunging oil prices, rising budget deficit and having its currency –riyal-tied to a strong USD. The minutes of the July FOMC meeting have already revealed an admission of lower inflation and downside risks from China.

PUNE, India 

Market research titled Frontier Pharma: Innovative Licensing Opportunities in Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma says NHL market product pipeline has innovation in varying degrees across the majority of molecular target families and development stages for NHL therapeutics.

Complete report on non hodgkin lymphoma market spread across 115 pages, covering 10 major NHL industry analysis headings and supported with 12 tables and 49 figures is now available at http://www.reportsnreports.com/reports/425096-frontier-pharma-innovative-licensing-opportunities-in-non-hodgkin-lymphoma.html .

The current developmental non hodgkin lymphoma market pipeline addresses present gaps in the market, dominated by cancer immunotherapies and inhibitors of cancer-associated signal transduction. Pathways of significant interest include B-cell receptor signaling, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, and Wnt/ß-catenin signaling, as well as oncogenes such as BCL-6 and BCL-2. Characteristic cell surface molecules that represent targets for cancer immunotherapies include CD19, LMP-1/2 and CD20, with several pipeline drugs already approved for CD20. First-in-class drug development in non hodgkin lymphoma market (NHL) corresponds strongly to these known somatic mutations and affected pathways. Clinical results of drugs against profiled targets in this non hodgkin lymphoma market report show many are being investigated in relapsed disease.

The product pipeline for non-hodgkin lymphoma market (NHL) exhibits a lower degree of innovation than both the industry and oncology average, with just 28% of all pipeline products, or 33% of the pipeline for which there is a disclosed molecular target, categorized as first-in-class. This is in comparison to industry, breast cancer and lung cancer innovation rates of 43%, 57% and 59%, respectively. While NHL, collectively, is the sixth to tenth most common cancer dependent on territory, each individual subtype is classified as an orphan disease. With significant differences in each subtype's genetic profile and current treatment, there is reduced scope for the development of a targeted non hodgkin lymphoma market therapy with cross-subtype activity.

This does not present non hodgkin lymphoma market drug development as an attractive investment in comparison to other indications in oncology, particularly as survival durations across many NHL subtypes are relatively strong, and likely the reason for low first-in-class innovation levels. Order a copy of Frontier Pharma: Innovative Licensing Opportunities in Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma 2015 market research report at http://www.reportsnreports.com/Purchase.aspx?name=425096 .

The scope of this non hodgkin lymphoma market report aims to answer multiple questions based on current industry status covering: There are 666 marketed products for non hodgkin lymphoma market, 95% of which are small molecules - what are the dominant mechanisms of action across marketed products? The treatment of lymphoma is dominated by the use of combination cyclophosphamide based chemotherapy in combination with rituximab - What are these chemotherapy regimens? How did they perform in key clinical trials? The variation in molecule type has shifted away from small molecules, whose dominance has decreased to 46% across the pipeline - What are the dynamics of the remaining 54% of the pipeline? How does this reflect the need for novel targeted therapies? There is a significant shift away from cytotoxic agents, with the current pipeline dominated by cancer immunotherapies and signal transduction inhibitors - What is the scientific rationale behind these mechanisms of action? How successful have approved targeted therapies been? Profiled first-in-class therapies include: PIK3CA, EZH2, CD40 and MDM2 - What is the scientific rationale behind these targets? What preclinical and clinical results are available for drugs against these targets? What is the overall opinion on these targets for drug development across non hodgkin lymphoma market?

This latest non hodgkin lymphoma market report also notes that despite the difficulty of several targeted NHL therapies in achieving improved efficacy rates, the development of such treatments remains of key interest across NHL. It is hoped that one of these many targeted therapy pipeline products will replicate the success observed with rituximab, which significantly altered the NHL treatment landscape following its approval. Clear gaps in the treatment algorithm include maintenance therapies to prolong initial or subsequent durations of remission, and improved therapies for relapsed patients, particularly those with a second or subsequent relapse.

On a related note, market research titled Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma - Pipeline Review, H1 2015 report is spread across 868 pages and provides comprehensive information on the therapeutic development for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, complete with comparative analysis at various stages, therapeutics assessment by drug target, mechanism of action (MoA), route of administration (RoA) and molecule type, along with latest updates, and featured news and press releases. It also reviews key players involved in the therapeutic development for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and special features on late-stage and discontinued projects.

4013,"Designed by Grupo Arquitectura , this modern family crib known as Dalias House is located in Mexico City. Concrete and steel make up the basic structure of the Dalias House. Glass comes in to offer an openness that helps integrate the outdoors in the interior spaces and create an unbreakable bond between the two. Imported furniture and automated electrical systems compose both visual and technological appeal. A comfortable ambiance reigns inside. Outdoor spaces are what give this house the feeling of freedom. 

The first impression fails to showcase the connection between interiors and outdoors, as the closed volumetric architecture focuses on the importance of home privacy, as well as space orientation. 



Photos by Agustín Garza show two separate limestone volumes that shape the 11,840 square foot home. These two separate geometric volumes have been imagined to be almost closed to the street. The transparency of this house was aimed at the garden, making the family feel safe and allowing them to have both privacy and openness. 

The main lobby keeps all spaces connected. From this central spine, the flow between the rooms all guide your steps to the garden. Terraces facing south and west capture and draw natural light deep inside the home. Imagined to be both suited for sunshine-filled days when you want to spend time by the pool but also have some shade inside, when you decide to call it a day, aluminum sunshades were mounted on top of floor-to-ceiling windows . 



Beige limestone, black granite, leather, all these are textured colors that can be found inside this modern family crib. Pops of color were embedded through furniture and furnishings, but the largest color splash is the green garden. Neutral colors shape a versatile environment that can become a joyful opportunity to decorate as they please. 

Sustainability features ensure owners have a constant pleasurable environment. Optimal space orientation, solar cells heating the pool water and domestic use and radiant heating, alongside recycling wastewater for irrigation and water purification filters maintain a balance in the house’s environmental responsibility. Check out the 10 of the hottest green technologies for an in-depth look at what modern homes flaunt these days.

1259,"The Saskatchewan Roughriders have opted go with experience over youth for Saturday's game against the Ottawa Redblacks. 
 
Interim head coach Bob Dyce announced on Tuesday that Kevin Glenn will start at quarterback ahead of rookie Brett Smith. 
 
""Our objective this week is to win. Kevin Glenn gives us the best opportunity to win this game against Ottawa, so he will start at quarterback,"" said Dyce. 
 
This decision was really the first major one that Dyce has had to make since being named to his new job a couple of weeks ago. 
 
There were two prevailing thoughts when it came to Glenn or Smith this week. Should the Riders put their best foot forward to win, or try and develop for the future with the playoffs all but mathematically out of the equation? 
 
""The playoffs may be out for (the media and fans) but not for us. There's still an opportunity,"" said Dyce. 
 
""The real reason is this, when we walked into the room a while ago, we said our focus was winning games."" 
 [embedded content] 
Glenn has been out since tearing his pectoral muscle against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats on July 26 at Mosaic Stadium. 
 
Even though it's only been a month-and-a-half, for Glenn, it's felt like an eternity since he was able to play. 
 
""My concern was just to get back healthy. Get back and healthy and when I can give the opportunity or I get an opportunity to help the team, then I'm just going to try and take advantage of it,"" he said. 
 
Smith will now return to the role of backup quarterback, a job he held for a few weeks after Darian Durant went down with a season ending injury in the opening week of the season. 
 
Dyce feels that Smith dropping down the depth chart will actually be a good thing for him. 
 
""Now it gives him an opportunity to see how a very successful professional quarterback operates and manages a game. That's just something Brett hasn't had the opportunity to see."" 
 
Smith admits that taking a step back is always a little frustrating because as a player, you want to play. Overall though, he understands the decision and will do what he can to help the team. 
 
""That's the direction that the coaches want to go, I'm going to be the best teammate I can for Kevin,"" he said. 
 MESSAM MISSES PRACTICE  
Another big story line out of practice on Tuesday was the status of running back Jerome Messam. 
 
During Saturday's Banjo Bowl, Messam left the game after taking a pretty serious hit. Messam returned to the game some 10 minutes later. 
 
On Tuesday, Dyce announced that Messam was going through the concussion protocol. That begs the question, why was he allowed to return the game? 
 
""Here's the thing, you don't know necessarily with regards to if someone has a concussion. There's a lot of different things that go into diagnosing a concussion. More than I can understand, that's for sure,"" said Dyce. 
 
""We have 100 per cent faith in our medical staff that they make the right decisions."" 
 NEWS AND NOTES  
Also absent from practice on Tuesday were defensive back Terrell Maze and fullback Scott McHenry. 
 
Fullback Spencer Moore returned to practice as he's eligible to return from the six-game injured list, as did receiver Seydou Junior Hadaira.

3752,"Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit has urged Dominicans to take precautionary measures even though Tropical Storm Grace is expected to weaken on Tuesday as it moves closer towards the Lesser Antilles.  
 
The Miami-based National Hurricane Centre (NHC) said that the storm is expected to become a tropical depression with winds of 40 miles per hour. It is now located 1,360 miles east of the Lesser Antilles. 
 
Skerrit’s plea comes as the island continues to recover from the battering it received from Tropical Storm Erika that has been blamed for more than 30 deaths and a number of people reported missing and now presumed dead. 
 
The country has also estimated damage to its infrastructure in excess of US$600 million and is appealing to the international community to help in the rebuilding exercise. 
 
Prime Minister Skerrit in his address to the nation on Monday night said “regardless of this weakening — and this is what I want you to listen to very carefully, my dear people ,  the current projection is for an increase in shower and thunderstorm activity, which could be heavy at times across Dominica on Friday, with the possibility of flash flooding”. 
 
Skerrit said he is advised that a tropical wave is expected to produce some unstable conditions on Wednesday with model projections estimating rainfall amounts of 15 to 20 millimeters across Dominica. 
 
“Under normal circumstances, an inch of rain on Wednesday would be a windfall for farmers and sea-craft users. But on this occasion, it spells trouble for residents of several communities across Dominica. The earth is saturated and will not easily absorb an inch of rain,” Skerrit said. 
 
He told citizens that he has also been listening to structural engineers who are warning of “the grave and present danger” posed by the threat of additional torrential rainfall in Dominica at this time. 
 
“I wish to take this opportunity to issue a word of warning to residents of this country. Now is not the time for dare-devil maneuvers. We have been given adequate warning of the likelihood of torrential showers and flash flooding and we all must pay heed.” 
 
Skerrit acknowledged that this will be difficult and uncomfortable for many, but said, “we are all one people and we have got to batten down and see this period of trial and adversity through. 
 
“If you know you are living in areas that are susceptible to flooding or you are in the path of busted riverbanks and water courses, I am urging you, from now, to consider a shelter or bunking with a relative or friend elsewhere, during the upcoming days of anticipated bad weather. It is better to be safe than sorry. 
 
“Landslides have heavily impacted the road system and those affected areas have by no means stopped shifting. They therefore currently present a very real danger,” Skerrit said in his radio and television broadcast. 
 
 “I therefore again, appeal to those who were victims of landslides and slippage during the passage of Tropical Storm Erika, to be especially vigilant and mindful of the fact that conditions around you could deteriorate in the event of the forecasted rainfall materializing,”  Prime Minister said.",b76db276-2624-462d-8046-b3b980887948,News,2015-09-08T15:37:54Z,Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation,PM Skerrit issues warning as Tropical Storm Grace approaches the island,0.0,Blog

The workshop is part of a national effort to equip entrepreneurs with the tools needed to think differently about their businesses and accelerate success. 
     
CEO of Raizcorp, who will also be facilitating the one-day session, explains that the SimplyBiz Shift Questions workshop will teach entrepreneurs to shift the paradigms of their thinking. 
 
“Many people have this notion that if they follow the exact steps that a successful entrepreneur took in their own journey, they too will become successful,” says Raiz. “As a young man, I asked my mentor what the secret was to becoming wealthy. Surely if it were as simple as reading a book on 10 steps to success everyone would be rich?”

958,"Here at Save City Tatts we've taken a close interest in the whole ""live baiting"" issue since the story broke in February.

What struck us from the start was that everything the ABC discovered about the state regulator for the greyhound industry exactly matched what City Tatts members discovered in their dealings with the state regulator for registered clubs (Office of Liquor, Gaming & Racing).

This is not really surprising, since it is the same government department (Dept of Gaming & Racing) and the same minister (Troy Grant).

New revelations from the ABC about live baiting help to explain how the destruction of City Tattersalls Club could go on this long.

Here is a quick summary of the similarities between live baiting and the destruction of City Tatts:

Greyhound Racing knew all along about live baiting, as internal emails now prove.

OLGR have known for years that Tony Guilfoyle was running City Tatts into the ground (with Patrick Campion turning a blind eye). They were specifically told that the plan was to run the club so badly that Guilfoyle would claim that a property development was the only option.

Greyhound Racing NSW repeatedly failed to do anything about live baiting.

OLGR repeatedly failed to do anything about the looting of City Tatts.

Greyhound Racing NSW tipped off trainers that they were going to be raided.

OLGR tipped off Tony Guilfoyle about any complaints from members and assured him that nothing would be done about them.

Greyhound Racing NSW said they were ""shocked"" that live baiting was going on.

If the ABC ever do a story on corruption at City Tatts, or in the club industry, we fully expect OLGR to be ""shocked"" that there was any.

Meanwhile, the airhead development stumbles along under the supervision of those two hopeless clowns, Tweedledum and Tweedledee.

680,"For the first time, the Food and Drug Administration has ordered a major tobacco company to stop selling brands of cigarettes. 

The FDA on Tuesday ordered the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company to stop selling for brands: Camel Bold Crush, Vantage Tech 13 and the regular and menthol versions of Pall Mall Deep Set Recessed Filter cigarettes. 

The FDA has ordered other cigarettes off the market before, but those actions involved much smaller companies selling much less popular cigarettes. 

The agency says it took the action because R.J. Reynolds had failed to prove the brands were no more dangerous than brands that have been on the market longer. 

""These decisions were based on a rigorous, science-based review designed to protect the public from the harms caused by tobacco use,"" Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, said in a statement. ""The agency will continue to review product submissions and exercise it's legal authority and consumer protection duty to remove products from the market when they fail to meet the public health bar set forth under law."" 

Congress gave the FDA authority to regulate cigarettes for the first time in 2009. Among the agency's new powers are the authority to require new brands to prove they pose no more risks to smokers than cigarettes that were put on the market before Feb. 15, 2007. 

The FDA says R.J. Reynolds had failed to show the four brands that have been ordered off the market do not expose smokers to more harmful chemicals, higher levels of menthol or new ingredients.

486,"FinanceInvestments Foreign Investors Enabled to Own Shares in UAE’s National Telecommunication Company
August 20, 2015
Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter In an historic move, UAE Federal Law No. 01 of 1991 has been amended by Federal Decree by Law No. 03 of 2015, and new Articles of Association have been issued by the UAE Cabinet of Ministers. The amendments introduce momentous changes, including the possibility of foreign investors owning shares in Etisalat Group, while Etisalat’s legal name will change to Emirates Telecommunications Group Company PJSC, but will continue to be known as Etisalat Group.
These changes allow for legal persons, including institutions, in the United Arab Emirates, or UAE government agencies, or other legal persons, to own shares in Etisalat. Also, non-national individuals and entities may own up to 20 percent of Etisalat Group’s shares, subject to the approval of the Etisalat Group Board of Directors. However, restrictions in respect of voting rights shall be applied to the shares owned by non-nationals and such shares shall not hold any voting rights at Etisalat Group’s general assembly although holders of such shares may attend general assembly meetings.
Commenting on the changes, Eissa Al Suwaidi, Chairman, Etisalat Group, said, “The approval to allow institutional and foreign ownership of Etisalat Group’s equity will have a positive impact for both Etisalat Group’s shareholders and the Stock Exchange. It also sends out a strong signal that the UAE is open for business and will enhance Etisalat brand recognition around the world.”
In addition to ordinary shares, a “Special Share” will be issued to the Federal Government of the UAE (the “Special Shareholder”), pursuant to the approval of Etisalat Group’s Board of Directors. Etisalat Group will also be entitled to issue different classes of shares. Other than the issuance of the Special Share, Etisalat Group does not intend to issue any additional shares at this time.
Ahmad Julfar, Group Chief Executive Officer, Etisalat, added that the move will enable Etisalat to continue to invest in the innovative products and services which customers demand and are vital in the highly competitive global telecommunications sector.
“As a result, I am confident that Etisalat will go from strength to strength and continue delivering long-term value to our shareholders,” he said.
Some of the other material changes include the ability for Etisalat Group to establish a new operating company for the purpose of operating its telecommunications network business and providing telecommunication services in the UAE, subject to Special Shareholder approval, and establishing a share buyback programme at any time in accordance with the conditions and procedures set out in the relevant law and subject to the prior approval of the Emirates Securities and Commodities Authority.
In accordance with the new law, Etisalat Group will carry out the procedures required to implement and align its status with the provisions of the new law within one year from the date of its issue.

5375,"Traffic ahead: The leaders of at least 3 billion of the planet's people are stopping by for a visit.
America is playing host to an impressive glut of dignitaries in the next several days as the United Nations convenes high-level General Assembly meetings in New York -- and that doesn't even include the three top world leaders set to tour the U.S., leaving snarls of traffic in their wake.
Pope Francis is already drawing huge crowds as he visits Washington Wednesday and heads to New York and Philadelphia later in the week. Chinese President Xi Jinping Mark Ralston / Pool / Getty Images Chinese President Xi Jinping speaks beside Boeing executives after his tour of the Boeing assembly line on September 23, 2015, in Seattle, Washington. Chinese President Xi Jinping speaks beside Boeing executives after his tour of the Boeing assembly line on September 23, 2015, in Seattle, Washington. (Mark Ralston / Pool / Getty Images)
Chinese President Xi Jinping landed in Seattle on Tuesday, where he was visiting business leaders and touring a nearby Boeing factory before heading for Washington.
Then, this weekend, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will tour Facebook's offices and meet other Silicon Valley leaders for the first visit to California by an Indian leader in 33 years. On Sunday, he'll also give a speech in a stadium in San Jose. Each man leads at least 1 billion people around the world. (Only a small portion of the world's 1 billion Catholics live in India and China.) 
They are all here in part because of the annual U.N. General Assembly gathering in New York.
 “You do always see it this time of year, a lot of heads of state coming in [because of the U.N.],"" said Kal Raustiala, director of the Burkle Center for International Relations at UCLA.  ""It makes sense for them to tack on something else.” The General Assembly has created a cottage industry of sorts of international events happening alongside the U.N. meetings. “Everybody’s in New York because everybody’s in New York,” Raustiala said.
Xi, Modi and the pontiff will all be delivering speeches at a U.N. global development summit beginning Friday that is expected to attract a record 150 heads of state and government,  U.N. spokeswoman Francyne Harrigan told the Los Angeles Times.
Other notables expected in New York next week include Russian President Vladimir Putin, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Cuban President Raul Castro. cComments Got something to say? Start the conversation and be the first to comment. Add a comment 0 Pope Francis is expected to use the platform to urge action on the environment and migrants. Xi and Modi are more interested in deepening commercial ties. ""They are two of the fastest growing economies in the world. At the same time, China’s economy is 4.5 times as large as India’s because it’s grown much faster over the last 25 years,"" Anil Gupta, an expert on the U.S.-India-China triangle and chair in strategy and entrepreneurship at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business, told The Times this week.
In the technology sector, ""Under Xi Jinping, China has become decidedly unfriendly to multinational companies while India has become more fundamentally open to multinationals, not just in technology but in sectors like autos and telecoms,"" Gupta said.
State Department historians weren't sure whether this week's simultaneous visits by world leaders were unusual, a spokeswoman said. The department tracks historical data on visits by foreign leaders here.
Another event that drew a large roster of foreign dignitaries to the U.S. was former President Ronald Reagan's funeral in 2004. Nearly 40 current and former world leaders attended the service at the Washington National Cathedral.

548,"India is likely to push for an early finalisation of the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement with Sri Lanka during the September 14-16 visit of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to New Delhi. 
 
It will be the newly elected Sri Lankan PM's first visit to New Delhi, as well as his first official visit abroad after January, when he was first appointed to the post. 
 
Wickremesinghe had expressed his support for a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with India only two months ago at a business forum in Colombo, asking Sri Lankan businessmen not to fear it but see it as an opportunity. 
 
The two countries have been talking about a CEPA for several years, but Sri Lankan opposition to it stalled its finalisation. India, government sources said, will now be looking to tie up the details with Wickremesinghe's ""national unity government"" and work towards finalising the agreement. 
 
Wickremesinghe has also spoken in favour of a land bridge between Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu and Thalaimannar on Sri Lanka's western coast. More than the Sethusamudram project, which has now been almost given up, the idea of a land bridge has supporters in the Modi government. 
 
The Sri Lankan PM is likely to have a lunch meeting with his counterpart Narendra Modi on September 15, aside from meetings with others in India's political leadership the same day.

5126,"David Thornton
Copy Editor With the clock ticking down until Oct. 13, the last day for voter registration, a number of ODU student organizations are making it their goal to register as many student voters as possible. On Nov. 3, Virginia will be holding elections for numerous seats in both houses of the state legislature. On Tuesday, Sept. 22, ODU’s Student Government Association led by example. During their “SGA Day” event, each committee of the student government operated a booth that informed students about their individual roles and missions. The committee for Legislative Affairs and Diversity used theirs to inform students about the upcoming election, test their general knowledge of voting and register students to vote. Rachael Edmonds, director of the committee, quizzed students about elections and voting, handing out t-shirts for correct answers. Monique Williams, another member of the committee, walked students through the process of registering on a laptop. Together, they helped 250 students learn how to register to vote. They used a system known as TurboVote, which not only aids people in registering to vote, but also sends out alerts via text and email reminding voters of upcoming elections. It can also walk voters through the process, informing them what identification to bring, where their polling place is located and helping to obtain absentee ballots. Other organizations use this program as well, including the ODU College Democrats. “It’s a nice program for letting students know about upcoming elections,” Charles Christie, president of the ODU College Democrats, said. This year, they’ve helped register about 150 students to vote. “It’s good for an off-year election,” Christie said. In the recent weeks, they have set up a table in the main lobby of the Webb Center during activity hour. Many ODU students were not old enough to vote in the 2012 presidential election. The voting process is foreign to them. In addition, a great deal of them are unaware that an election is even occurring this year. “Some of them, I’m confused when they don’t know,” Williams said, referring to the number of students who could not answer the general election questions. Some of the questions included naming the date of the next election, or the name of a candidate. One student at the SGA Day event was aware of the Nov. 3 elections, and planned to vote absentee. “We have a small town,” Elizabeth Heath, a sophomore, said, noting that she personally knew some of the local candidates. However, she said that she didn’t know much about the state-level candidates. “The media that most people engage with is national, so not a lot of people know about these smaller Virginia state elections,” Christie said. “What really affects you most are these small decisions in Richmond.” In addition to helping students register to vote, he’s encouraged students to get involved in the campaigns. So far, he’s helped students become volunteers or interns with three different campaigns. The College Democrats are also hosting phone banking events for some of the campaigns before the presidential debates. They provide scripts, and teach students how to campaign for candidates over the phone. “It’s one big democratic call-fest,” Christie said. Another student organization, the National Association of Blacks in Criminal Justice, will be hosting multiple voter registration events in the month of October. The biggest obstacle to encouraging students to vote in off-year elections is the lack of information and general sense of apathy. “If you want a progressive president with a progressive agenda, they can only be as successful as states allow them to be,” Christie said. “The progressive policies can or can’t happen depending on how involved you are in the years leading up to an election.”    ",50b6542e-7a3f-4c6c-ab73-170ba7fd964d,Blog,2015-09-27T03:44:33Z,Mace & Crown,Student Organizations Encourage Voter Registration,1.0,News
2416,"MY GIRLFRIEND AND I flew to the Dominican Republic in the spring for a short vacation before starting our summer jobs. Almost as soon as we landed, however, Haiti began to beckon us. It was not the kind of siren song one hears from places like Thailand with its romantic beaches or France with its alluring culinary offerings. Haiti called to us like a bad conscience, more of a haunting than an enticement.
You could not read about Haiti without hearing that it was the poorest country in the western hemisphere, that it was still recovering from the earthquake of 2010, or that the United Nations had been present in the country for over ten years on an extended ""Stabilization Mission"".
""But we're so close,"" I said.
Hayley cut to the chase. ""Then let's go. We've been in the Dominican Republic for almost a week and all we seem to talk about is Haiti.""
It was true, Haiti was the elephant in the room. The DR was itself a poor country, but it had a thriving tourist industry and a stable government. Playing tourist on the beaches of the Dominican Republic, a few miles from a humanitarian crisis zone, somehow felt wrong. So we began looking into our options for travel across the border. Dominican buses traveled to two destinations in Haiti: Port-au-Prince and Cap-Haïtien. That was the easy part. Finding a place to stay was more difficult. There didn't seem to be any affordable options. The hostel sites were blank and the other websites offered nothing but luxury accommodations which all but screamed, ""Your safe-house in Haiti!"" We managed to locate a reasonably priced bungalow on the beach near Jacmel in the south, but when we contacted the owner for directions he sent us the following e-mail:
From Port-Au-Prince (PAP) take a taxi to the Jacmel Bus Station at Portail Leogane in PAP ($30 US). At the Jacmel Bus Station (in PAP) take a minivan or bus to Jacmel ($ 4.40; Peak Times: $6.70). The buses run from dawn to 6 pm and leave every 15 min. or so. During Rush Hour: The buses will stop at the PAP Bus Station on the outskirts of Jacmel. From there, travelers have 2 options: Hire a moto-taxi from the PAP Bus Station to Coterelle Breeze in Coterelle ($5.50), or hire a moto-taxi from the PAP Bus Station to the Marigot Bus Station in downtown Jacmel ($0.55). During NON Rush Hour: The buses will stop in downtown Jacmel. From the Marigot Bus Station, take a minivan (taptap) going towards Marigot ($0.90) or moto-taxi ($4.50). You are going to Coterelle which is right before Marigot. Ask the driver or a fellow rider to stop the taptap at the first gate on the right after Port Pigeons in Coterelle (about 5 minutes past Plage Ti Mouillage). It’s the only port in Coterelle so you could just say the Coterelle Port...
And it went on. Almost as an afterthought he suggested that for $50 he could send someone to meet us in Port-Au-Prince and walk us through the entire process.
We decided to head north to Cap-Haïtien instead. In every country that I've traveled there is a place which is nicknamed, ""The Paris of so-and-so."" There was Buenos Aires, The Paris of South America; San Francisco was The Paris of the West; and Shanghai was known as The Paris of the East. The expression has been so liberally applied to so many places that it says less about the subject than its object, ie. Paris is the center of the world. Nevertheless, I was surprised when I read that Cap-Haïtien was once known as ""The Paris of the Antilles."" Was Haiti ever considered a five-star destination? Not really, unless you were an 18th-century French slave owner with a large sugar plantation. What a difference three centuries can make!
There was a direct bus from Santo Domingo to Cap-Haïtien so Hayley and I booked a next-day departure. We found a reasonably priced room at the grand-sounding Hotel Imperial for two nights and hoped for the best. The journey began in the early morning and we took our seats on the nearly empty bus, fingering our packs for reassurance: Tickets, check. Money, check. Rum, check. Our passports had been taken before boarding and we were told they would be returned to us at the border. Once we left the garbage-strewn cityscape of Santo Domingo the landscape became green and inviting. As we passed through this verdant country I thought about all the other countries I'd visited and how I only ever seemed to relax once I'd left the populated areas and journeyed to the remote regions. This was perhaps the motivation that drove humankind across the Bering Strait and allowed us to populate the entirety of the Earth: the search for a place to call one's own. As the rum took effect and I began to wax philosophic about the destiny of Man, Hayley - a freshly-minted Anthropology major - scoffed at my theories and called me a racist.
We crossed into Haiti at the Massacre River, a large and mostly dry riverbed, where a tall, lanky man came aboard holding a brick of money. I handed him fifty dollars and received well over two-thousand gourdes in return. It's a bit silly, but for me one of the great pleasures of travel is receiving enormous quantities of foreign currency in exchange for a few American dollars and savoring, albeit briefly, the illusion of great wealth (which is one of the reasons I don't like traveling to England). Our passports were stamped and returned and we drove on. The first noticeable difference was in the architecture. Although most houses appeared to be little more than shacks with corrugated roofs, the more permanent homes resembled French cottages. Built from cinder blocks and uniformly gray, all were embellished with decorative balustrades and other ornamental touches which lent them a certain elegance, as if they were simply awaiting a final and festive dash of paint. A few miles from the border we found ourselves rolling through green fields with picturesque hills and mountains beyond. I could already feel my preconceptions fading, being forced aside by this pleasant scenery, but before I could say ""What a lovely country!"" Cap-Haïtien came into view.

My first impression was of a place that had fallen apart. A place that no longer worked. There was a bunkered UN compound with blue-helmeted soldiers standing guard in watchtowers, their rifles held close to their chests, the walls around them crowned with barbed wire. Hazy hills enclosed a bay where a few barges lay immobile in the sea. Scattered palm trees rose above an empty beach that was no beach; it looked like a sidewalk after being violated by jackhammers. We crossed the Mapou River and stared down into a vast sewer. Floating trash extended from either bank and narrowed the channel to only a few navigable feet. The hills themselves were thick with flimsy homes as the outer slums crawled upslope, away from the city, like a wounded animal. Our bus was swallowed by traffic when it entered the downtown area. Motorcycles buzzed past like mosquitoes while tap-taps and trucks blared their horns impatiently or made their own lanes around us. I looked, appalled, at gutters that were nothing more than rivers of plastic waste, and above us French balconies clung precariously to buildings and threatened to collapse under the weight of residents who noted our passing without interest. Then the bus stopped. We'd arrived.
Frankly, I didn't want to get off the bus. Cap-Haïtien had confirmed all of my worst fears about Haiti except the fear of violence, which is why I wanted to stay on the bus. Then I realized that Hayley was relying on me to take care of business here. In the Dominican Republic she had used her Spanish skills to translate for me. Now, in French-speaking Haiti, it was my turn. I grabbed my bag and hopped off the bus, landing in the middle of a crowd of young touts. Instead of descending upon me with offers of hotels, taxis, and ""clean girls"" as I'd anticipated, they stopped talking and just stared at me. I realized that they were just surprised to see a white face. It only took them a moment to regain their composure, and then the offers came. I said the name of our hotel and they shouted prices at me, which sounded extortionate, but only because the quotes were in gourdes.
""Five hundred!"" the first one shouted.
""Four hundred!"" another countered.
""I will take you there for three hundred!"" a third offered.
There was no need to haggle. They were doing it for me. I simply took the lowest price and we dove into his car.
The Hotel Imperial was not far away, but our driver fought for every gourde of his fare. Traffic was so chaotic it was like being treated to a preview reel of potential ways to die. The scenery, however, was constant: a monotonous landscape of decay. Hayley and I had fallen into a silent reverie, common to edgy travelers and the condemned, so it came as a pleasant surprise when our taxi pulled into a shady courtyard in front of a peach-colored hotel with a pool surrounded by deck chairs. It hardly mattered that the pool was filled with greenish water and the air-conditioning in the room didn't work. We were in Haiti, and we weren't dead.
Hayley and I unpacked, showered, played cards, finished the last of our rum, and finally decided to explore the city. Hand in hand, like children, we sortied into the street. Everyone stared at us, even a group of ladies who were carrying enormous loads on their heads paused to watch us pass. A group of kids from a nearby school followed us, but kept a safe distance until they could goad one of their number into approaching us.
""Bonjour,"" he said.
""Bonjour,"" I said back.
He looked over his shoulder at his classmates, who urged him on.
""Give me money,"" he said in English.
I smiled. ""Pourquoi?""
He looked at his friends again and they ran off. Hayley gave him some candy and we crossed the street to a cafe.
Pushing open a metal door we entered a dirt-floored room with a few bored ladies sitting at flimsy plastic tables. They exchanged glances until one of them sighed and approached us with a menu, then slumped back in her chair. Hayley and I scanned the overpriced menu and wordlessly devised an escape plan. It seemed that in Haiti you either paid the tourist price or the local price. There was nothing in between.
I handed the menu back to the lady. ""Maybe later,"" I said.
She glanced at her cohorts and they smiled knowingly. I wouldn't pay these prices either.
We continued down the street, hopping over broken pieces of sidewalk and trying not to breathe too deeply around the sewage channels. ""What am I doing here?"" I thought. Granted, that thought went through my mind everywhere I traveled, but it seemed to carry more weight here in the midst of such poverty. I did what any sane individual would do. I looked for a bar.

We wandered the streets for an hour or so, meeting a motorcycle taxi gang who supported their families on a dollar a day and a few street hustlers who considered it a good day's work if they separated a tourist from a gourde or two, and then returned to our hotel. We'd given up on getting a drink when we noticed that the hotel bar was open. The barman, a handsome man in his mid twenties, was chatting with one of his co-workers in Creole. As we approached he turned to us with a smile.
""Je m'appelle Gil,"" he said, extending his hand in welcome.
I introduced myself and my companion.
""D'où venez vous?"" he asked.
I told him we'd come from the United States and he asked if Hayley spoke French. When I said non he immediately addressed her in English.
""Is this your first time in Haiti?""
It is one of those nonsensical truths about the world that you often meet people in your travels who are far better educated or talented than yourself, people who should be lecturing you about your shortcomings, who are instead pouring you a drink or cleaning up after you.
Upon hearing her native tongue Hayley perked up and began to barrage him with questions about his country. As was her wont, she ignored any small talk and went straight for the larger issues.
""What do you think about the United Nations?"" she asked.
He hesitated.
""I'm just wondering because we saw a UN compound on the way into town,"" she added, taking a sip of Prestige beer. ""Do Haitians like having them here?""
He looked around. You could almost see the disclaimer appear below his face: The views of the bartender do not necessarily represent those of the hotel or any of its affiliates...
""They have done some good things,"" he said diplomatically.
""But..."" Hayley prodded.
""But they should leave now,"" he conceded.
""Why?""
""They are taking jobs that Haitians can do, and..."" he glanced around once more.
Sensing his discomfort, I tried to change the subject.
""Did you feel the earthquake here?"" I asked.
Both he and Hayley laughed.
""Port-au-Prince is over a hundred miles away,"" Gil said.
""Yeah, James,"" Hayley snickered, then leaned closer to the barman. ""Anyway...""
So I shut up and let them continue.
Gil lowered his voice.
""They have killed our people,"" he said. ""Hundreds have been shot by the UN."" He noted our surprise and added, ""You don't hear about it in your press, but here it is common knowledge.""
This was explosive stuff. My inner journalist stirred to life and I decided to check on his claim. I discovered that what Gil said was not true. The reality, however, was worse. The UN had sent several international brigades into Haiti after the 2010 earthquake in order to provide aid and stability. One of these groups came from Nepal and brought, along with food and water, a deadly strain of cholera that ended up killing over 6,000 Haitians. Riots erupted when outraged locals learned who was to blame for the epidemic and over a dozen protesters were shot by UN security forces in the ensuing clashes. Despite its honorable intentions the international community was beginning to realize that getting involved with Haiti was like sleeping with a damaged girl: there was going to be drama.
I SAT ALONE in the dining room the next morning, waiting for Hayley to join me. Ceiling fans whirled noiselessly in the empty room while I jotted notes in my journal. The Imperial felt like one of those forgotten colonial enclaves you see moldering in hot countries the world over. The Imperial had never been a colonial haunt, it had simply gone straight to seed. The night before, Gil had made arrangements for us to be picked up by one of his friends on a motorcycle taxi. Our destination was the Citadelle LaFerrière. The Citadel is the largest fort in the Americas, constructed by Henri Christophe, a slave who became a general in Haiti's war of independence against the French. After the war, the rebel general Jean-Jacques Dessalines proclaimed himself Emperor. He was soon assassinated, but Henri Christophe followed his lead, proclaiming himself ""King of Haiti, Sovereign of [the] adjacent islands, Destroyer of tyranny, Regenerator and Benefactor of the Haïtian nation, Creator of her moral, political, and martial institutions, First crowned monarch of the New World, Defender of the faith, Founder of the Royal Military Order of Saint Henry."" He was an unpopular autocrat and, consumed by paranoia, took his own life.
Alexander arrived on his Haojin motorcycle and we climbed aboard. At first I wondered if the three of us might be too much for his Chinese bike, which was no more than a 250cc, but there were entire families packed onto similar bikes so I stopped worrying about it. Alexander, however, was in a bad mood. He managed to force an occasional smile but generally kept silent. I asked him to pull over at a convenience store so we could pick up some water and he followed us dutifully through the musty aisles without comment. I told him to grab something for himself. ""C'est moi qui l'offre,"" I told him. He scanned the cooler and pulled out a 22-ounce Red Bull, confirming my suspicion that he was simply hung over. We hopped back on his bike and Alexander wove his way expertly through Cap-Haïtien traffic, which was not as terrifying as I'd anticipated, not like Bangkok. Before long we were in the countryside and he opened the throttle. Hayley's hair whipped against my face as we tore through a beautiful landscape of lush farmland.
It only took twenty minutes to reach the town of Milot at the base of the mountain where the Citadel was perched. Our white faces were spotted at once and an entrepreneurial assault was launched. Several motorcycles pulled up alongside us as we cruised through town and a young man shouted, ""Bienvenu au Milot! Je m'appelle Joseph, votre guide pour La Citadelle!"" We had found our guide, or rather, he had found us.
Alexander pulled into a parking area and seemed to enjoy our discomfort as we staggered backwards under a press of guides and merchants waving everything from sodas to wooden swords in our faces. Joseph elbowed his way through the group and grabbed my arm.
""Vous vous me souvenez? Joseph! Suivez-moi!""
He led us to the ticket booth where Hayley and I bought our entrance tickets and then he pulled us away to introduce another motorcycle taxi driver, which he said would be necessary for the steep climb up the mountain. Wherever we went we were surrounded by a throng of people shouting at us in French. Hayley looked at me with an expression that said, ""Do you know what's going on here?"" I asked Joseph how much his guide service would cost, but before he could answer there was a heightened chorus of excited voices.
""Forty dollars!"" someone offered.
""Thirty dollars!"" another countered.
""Twenty-five dollars!""
""I need a guide that speaks English,"" I said.
There was a noticeable lull and once again Joseph stepped forward.
""I will give you an excellent tour,"" he said in English, ""for twenty dollars.""
I got back on Alexander's bike and Hayley took her seat on the other. Joseph led the expedition from his own chariot and we roared away under the midday sun.
The road was a steep cobblestone path that nearly destroyed my spine, but what a view! Mountain ridges undulated down to the sea, which was green and indistinct from charcoal fires, while a heavy sun forced all clouds from the bright blue sky. As we came to the end of the road we were again surrounded by desperate merchants. I wanted to buy something. I wanted to help. But they were hawking cheap souvenirs; shoddy hats and wooden swords emblazoned with the words La Citadelle or I ♥ Haiti. I couldn't bring myself to fork out for this shit.
As Hayley and I dismounted to walk the final kilometer to the fort we found ourselves accompanied by an entourage of donkey dealers.
""You need!"" they said.
""Very far!""
""Very hot!""
""You tired!""
""Good price!""
Hayley relented and rented a donkey. ""I didn't want a fucking donkey,"" she told me later. ""I just wanted to get everyone off my back.""
And it worked. Once a sale had been made the rest of the troupe dissolved away.

The fort is usually described as resembling the prow of a ship, and that is an accurate description. It rises above the hilltop like a battleship cresting a wave and it would not seem unnatural if the entire edifice suddenly plunged toward the sea. There isn't much to distinguish one fort from another, and like chateaux along the Loire Valley they all share certain accoutrements. The Citadelle was no exception. There were high walls with small windows, massive cannons on swivels and pyramids of cannonballs, and a drawbridge. Built to withstand an assault from the colonial French army, it was never put to the test, either because the French lost interest or because the fort was considered impregnable. It certainly seemed impregnable to me with its thick walls, inaccessible location, and the fact that it afforded a 360-degree view of the surrounding valleys. Not to mention the fact that it was a sweltering climb to the top. Even the ladies who carried tubs of chilled soda - no less an effort than soldiers carrying arms - took frequent rest stops in the shade.
Joseph began his monologue and I quickly lost interest when I realized that his spiel amounted to little more than a verbatim reading of the free brochure for the site. That may not be precisely true, but it was certainly delivered with all the enthusiasm of a waiter listing the available choices of salad dressing. Hayley was kinder and listened his speech, leaving me free to wander the grounds.
On our way downhill we crossed paths with a contingent of UN workers huffing under the weight of their weapons. At first I thought it was admirable that these workers were taking an interest in local culture, but why bring rifles? I later discovered that because of its elevation the hilltop was used as a radio tower for the UN. The rifles were apparently just for show.
Alexander sped us back to Cap-Haïtien, from farmland to wasteland. Back at the hotel we handed over the agreed-upon sum plus a generous tip. Alexander took the money with a smile and shook my hand. As I started to walk away he called me back.
""Regardez!"" he said, pointing to the exhaust pipe on his motorcycle.
There was a small section where the chrome was black.  Then he pointed at my feet.  I lifted one of my sandals and saw that the sole had nearly burned through.  I'd been resting my foot on the hot surface the entire trip.
""I thought I smelled something,"" I said.
Hayley gave a droll shake of her head.  ""Consider yourself lucky.""
And that was the lesson I took with me from Haiti.",b2236b36-94cc-4b47-8e6e-8891906962c9,Blog,2015-09-06T04:57:18Z,squattersinparadise,Haiti: The Girl Next Door,1.0,News

5048,"Today, the North Dakota State Quarter Coin remembers the day, September 8, 1883, when a young Theodore Roosevelt stepped from the train in the western wilderness of what is now North Dakota. 
 
In his book, Roosevelt’s Ranch Life in North Dakota, Albert Tangeman Vollweiler included descriptions of Mr. Roosevelt’s arrival and his efforts as a cattle rancher. 
 
===== 
 
It was into this region that Theodore Roosevelt came in September, 1883. 
 
He had never been naturally robust and, therefore, by hard effort, he had learned while yet in his teens, to box, to ride, to shoot, and to stay out of doors with nature till he loved to do this. 
 
After he had served several terms in the New York Assembly, when he was yet a slender young man of twenty-six, he came over the Northern Pacific for a hunting trip in the Little Missouri Valley. 
 
When he arrived at the squalid shack town of Little Missouri on the west bank of the Little Missouri River, opposite which Medora was later built, he went to the rude hotel, taking his baggage along. 
 
This consisted chiefly of a fine collection of rifles. One was an Express, inlaid with gold plates engraved with hunting scenes. The one he usually used, however, was a Winchester of 45-90 calibre. 
 
The hotel was known as the Pyramid Park hotel. It was built of logs and was managed by E. H. Bly of Bismarck who made his living by cutting logs for ties and by boarding such men as came to Medora. 
 
It was the only building at Medora besides the station. The entire upper floor of the hotel consisted of a room which contained fourteen beds, and Roosevelt occupied one of these. 
 
The next day he met a ranchman, J. A. Ferris, who happened to be in town and, after a bargain had been made, the latter took him eight miles southward to his ranch, Chimney Butte. 
 
Here the party outfitted and, with ponies, blankets, rifles, and food, proceeded fifty miles southward. They returned late in the fall after a successful hunt. 
 
If this country supported such numbers of wild animals it would also support herds of cattle and so, before leaving, having been attracted by the health- giving life of a cattle ranch, Roosevelt purchased Chimney Butte Ranch. 
 
This included the horses and cattle that were marked with a Maltese Cross on their left hips, a few rude buildings and corrals, together with grazing rights over the surrounding region. 
 
Roosevelt retained the services of the former owners, Sylvane Ferris and A. W. Merrifield, to manage his new property. 
 
Most good cowmen used a Texan breed of cattle because of their size and their ability to withstand the winter. This was especially true of experienced cowmen who came from the South. 
 
Easterners usually made poorer stockmen unless they stayed long enough to learn the cattle business by experience. 
 
Roosevelt labored under this handicap. The cattle business was new to him and to his foreman, Sylvane Ferris. 
 
The latter had come from Canada and had previously hunted or worked on the Northern Pacific railroad. 
 
The year following Roosevelt’s purchase of Chimney Butte, he had shipped in to his ranch many carloads of Minnesota dogie cattle. 
 
They had no pride of ancestry, nor great size nor hardiness to withstand the winter. These things tended to preclude the possibility of making large profits. 
 
Roosevelt never owned any land in North Dakota. The land of the government was used freely by all ranchmen before it was surveyed and homesteaders came. 
 
Since there were no fences in the early stages of the ranching industry, the brand indicated the owner. 
 
The region was well adapted for cattle raising. The buttes break the force of the winter winds and the clusters of plum and buffalo-berry bushes, ash, box-elder, elm, and cedar trees afford natural shelter for stock. 
 
Grazing is good the year round, for the short nutritious grass ripens early. It thus escapes frosts and retains its food value and is as good as hay when obtained on exposed places in winter. 
 
The region soon built up rapidly. Eastern capitalists invested their money and men of intelligence, sometimes with a college education, and hardy, trusty pioneers managed their ranches, while Texan cowboys came to work on them. 
 
The latter formed the bulk of the population, so that the country west of the Missouri resembled the southwest more than the country east of the Missouri. 
 
Soon the valleys held great herds of cattle that found there abundant food both summer and winter. 
 
The cattle with the Maltese Cross brand now numbered about 3000. Eighty ponies were kept to help take care of them. Six men were employed in summer and three in winter. 
 
Their wages were about $35 to $40 per month with “room” and board. The foreman, Sylvane Ferris, was financially interested in the undertaking. 
 
In 1884 Roosevelt started a new ranch on untrodden ground at Elkhorn, also on the Little Missouri river, forty miles north of Chimney Butte. 
 
Here he built a very substantial log cabin out of logs that were all squared. It was a much better cabin than the one at Chimney Butte and served as Roosevelt’s headquarters. 
 
After he abandoned it, it was used as a lumber yard by the surrounding settlers. 
 
In 1904, there were only a few logs left to mark the spot where it stood. 
 
This ranch used an elkhorn and triangle for its brand and was managed by Sewall and Dow. 
 
The largest number of cattle on Roosevelt’s two ranches at any one time was about 5,000. 
 
They roamed from the Kildeer Mountains on the north to the Chalk Buttes on the south. 
 
… 
 
Young Roosevelt, like any new comer in the west, found people waiting for him to show what kind of a man he was. 
 
Bull-whackers, buffalo-hunters, broncho-busters, cow-punchers, and mule-skinners stated that this new eastern dude would soon be returning home. 
 
“Four-eyes,” one of them called him, because he committed the unpardonable offense in this country of wearing spectacles, though most people called him “Mr. Roosevelt.” 
 
When he brought in cattle they looked with furtive glances at the “stuck up tenderfoot shassayin’ ’round, drivin’ in cattle and chasin’ out game.” 
 
Even the unprejudiced waited askance till he made good. This he soon did. At intervals he would go out hunting for a day and sometimes make long trips. 
 
The hunger, cold, and wet inevitably encountered were lost on him. Though no crack sharpshooter or broncho-buster he was a good shot, a good rider, and took his medicine like a man. “Fer a critter with a squint he war plum handy with a gun,” remarked one pioneer. 
 
On the round-up he neither asked nor received any favors. He worked hard like any other cowboy, whether it was in the sweltering heat of midsummer, or in a blinding blizzard in early winter. 
 
He helped break his ranch horses, and rode both good and bad. 
 
Once, while on a round-up he was thrown from the saddle and broke the point of his shoulder; at another he cracked a rib. Being 100 miles from a doctor, these injuries had to heal themselves, and, besides, he had to get thru his work as best he could. 
 
Dantz tells us that the hard work on the round-up told on Roosevelt till be became rather gaunt, yet with grim, bull-dogged energy, he went thru it. On all occasions he fraternized with the cow-boys; he rode, ate, and slept with them; and at night listened to their simply told stories before a campfire.

If you’ve read any writings on writing, I’m sure you’ve seen some variation on the theme “protect the work”.  Successful writers carve out time to write and guard that time as sacred.
Yes of course you think as you read it. How will I ever become a writer/meet my writing goals if I don’t sit down and WRITE? Turns out in practice, that’s harder to execute. I don’t know about you, but as a working mom who is also trying to complete the first draft of her novel, I juggle so many balls, it’s hard to execute that protection order. 
But, sometimes? Sometimes I am my own worst enemy. I could protect the work, but I don’t, not because I don’t want to, but because I don’t believe in the value of what I’m doing. That’s PAID work, it MUST come first. Surely that non-profit organization needs my time and efforts more than my silly little story. My brain is a manipulative witch sometimes. I know my strengths and when a client, or group I belong to needs me to fill a role that plays to my strengths instead of protecting the work, I say yes. It’s the path of least resistance and it’s instant gratification. I’ve got a decent track record in marketing, communications and event planning. So I’ll do those for the positive strokes rather than toil on my writing where it’s a long, lonely and uncertain road.  Don’t get me wrong, I have lots of support but no one can get THIS story down on paper but me. 
This all came to a head recently. I feel strongly that non-profits are can be only truly successful when all members contribute. This particular commitment had changed in a way I hadn't anticipated. As I planned out my day in my head, I realized that in order to address this change, I was going to have to sacrifice my writing time. That stopped me in my tracks. I’ve been on a roll lately, adding on average 1,000 words a day to my WIP 4-5 days a week. To some that seems a paltry sum, but to me, it’s a fantastic amount. More important to me was the consistency. I was loathe to break that streak. 
It was a weird feeling to put MY work first, but I did it and in the end, it was the right decision for me. You know what? The world won’t end and my novel is one step closer to getting finished. 
I realized that as often as I’ve heard “protect the work”, I was still waiting for some magical superhero to come in and guard my writing time, or for someone else to say ""no you can't do that, you have to write"". Heh, turns out, *I* have the super powers. *I* protected the work. 
I did it this time, but I’m not naive.  There will be other times and other challenges. Knowing my personality, I’m always going to need to suck it up and say “but this matters to ME.”  As a matter of fact, if you’ll excuse me, I have some words to write.

Is protecting the work easy for you, or is it a challenge?",7c388005-daef-4af5-878c-1152c763353e,Blog,2015-09-15T12:00:43Z,Live to Write - Write to Live,Protecting The Work,1.0,News
3135,"For Donald Trump, the hits just keep on coming.  

A Rolling Stone profile piece on the billionaire front-runner recounts an episode in which Trump mocks rival Republican candidate Carly Fiorina's looks. The alleged slight took place aboard Trump's plane following a rally in Hampton, New Hampshire. The candidate was watching Fox News as staff members looked on. Reporter Paul Solotaroff described Trump's reaction when Fiorina appeared on screen:  

"" Look  at that face!"" he cries. ""Would anyone  vote  for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next  president ?!"" The laughter grows halting and faint behind him. ""I mean, she's a woman, and I'm not s'posedta say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we  serious ?""   

“Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!” 
 
Donald Trump 
 
""I think those comments speak for themselves,"" Fiorina said Wednesday on Megyn Kelly's show, adding, ""Maybe, just maybe I'm getting under his skin a little bit because I am climbing in the polls.""  

In fact, Trump had also singled out Fiorina at the Hampton rally, warning her in terms similar to those he used with moderator Kelly during the first Republican debate. 

""Carly was a little nasty to me—be  careful,  Carly! Be  careful ! But I can't say anything to her because she's a woman. . . . I  promised  that I wouldn't say that she ran Hewlett-Packard into the ground. I said I wouldn't say it! That her stock value tanked. That she laid off tens of thousands of people, and she got viciously fired. I said I will not  say  that. And that she then went out and ran against Barbara  Boxer,  and . . . lost in a landslide. And I said, 'I. Will. Not. Say. That!' ""

5219,"Baylor Coach Art Briles said Monday that he was embarrassed to find out that one of his assistant coaches was on the sideline during an Oklahoma home game, the second potential NCAA rules violation by his staff to be disclosed in as many weeks.
Briles said he wasn't aware beforehand that passing game coordinator Jeff Lebby, who is also his son-in-law, was going to be at the Sooners' game against Tulsa. When he found out, Briles said he called Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops after Saturday's game and apologized. Stoops alluded to an NCAA rule that prohibits off-campus, in-person scouting of future opponents.

(Chris Foster) ""That seems to be — that's a pretty fundamental rule. That's not allowed, so I don't know what he was doing here,"" Stoops said in Norman, Okla. ""It's something that needs to be reported and needs to be dealt with through the Big 12 office and our people. I'm sure they will.""
First-year Tulsa Coach Philip Montgomery, a former Baylor assistant, also apologized. ""Obviously, it was a mistake and a poor decision on my part to leave a credential for Jeff and his wife,"" Montgomery said in a statement. ""They were in the Oklahoma City/Norman area for a wedding and came to the game to support me. There was no malicious intent on my part. I've known Jeff since he was in the sixth grade. I called Coach Stoops today and apologized for this situation.""
There was no immediate response from Big 12 officials.

1932,"A Brief History of Bret Bielema’s Hideous Trolling David Quinn/AP College Football September 17, 2015 by Matt Borcas	Facebook Twitter Email Print Saturday’s clash between Texas Tech and Arkansas may not seem like a particularly compelling matchup on paper, but it does feature a head-coaching battle for the ages: the biggest sex symbol in college football history versus Kliff Kingsbury, who’s also somewhat handsome. Like any great showdown, the matchup between Bret Bielema and Kingsbury brings a clear good-evil dichotomy. With his utopian brand of football, uncanny resemblance to beloved actor Ryan Gosling, and popularity with the kids, Kingsbury represents the side of righteousness and light. Meanwhile, Bielema is an unapologetic troll whose face is chiseled onto the Mt. Rushmore of odious FBS coaches. His chief redeeming quality might be his candor. Naturally, Bielema’s reputation made Toledo’s shocking Week 2 upset of Arkansas rife with schadenfreude for the neutral observer — especially on the heels of Bielema’s accurate but irrelevant complaints about Ohio State’s schedule, which smacked of sour grapes.1 As a result, jokes about the Head Hog have abounded IRL and on Twitter in recent days. Even Rex Ryan got in on the action: #Bills coach Rex Ryan with a solid shot at Bret Bielema. pic.twitter.com/dfqZCvVjlx — Zach Heilprin (@ZachHeilprin) September 16, 2015 It wasn’t always this way. In terms of public perception, Bielema’s head-coaching career began auspiciously enough, with the former Iowa nose guard first making waves back in 2006, during his rookie campaign helming the Badgers. The NCAA had just instituted a dumb, ill-advised rule that required (among other things) the clock to start as soon as the ball was kicked off, not when it was received, which was ridiculous for a whole slew of reasons — primarily because it artificially shortened college football games, and who in their right mind would want less college football? This rule was unceremoniously discarded after one season, in part because Bielema had exploited it so ingeniously in a November game against Penn State. With 23 seconds left in the first half and the Badgers set to kick off, Bielema instructed his players to intentionally go offside twice, thus reducing the amount of time the Nittany Lions had to mount a drive before halftime. Joe Paterno was FURIOUS, but there was nothing the officials could do but shrug their shoulders and point to the rulebook. It’s a damn shame that video of this incident has been removed from YouTube. Initially, Bielema was lauded for exposing Rule 3-2-5-e as a sham. He was sticking it to the establishment, and as we all know, there aren’t many establishments more loathsome than the NCAA. In retrospect, though, it’s fair to wonder if Bielema’s motives were less altruistic than plain evil; maybe he got off on bullying his easily agitated peer. To quote noted college football guru Stephanie Tanner: How rude! Bielema’s standing as a bully became more evident over time, most notably when he went for a two-point conversion at the end of a blowout win over Minnesota in 2010, a wholly unnecessary move that led to a postgame dust-up with then–Golden Gophers coach Tim Brewster: Listen to Bielema try in vain to defend such a monstrously wicked decision. That right there is the voice of a coaching sociopath, ladies and gentlemen. Want more proof? Later that season, the Badgers posted a preposterous 83 points on Indiana, the poverty-stricken child of college football teams. Hilariously, Bielema proceeded to make an appearance on Mike and Mike in an ill-fated attempt at damage control, but no one was buying the “Who, me?” routine. At least Woody Hayes had the decency to run up the score on good teams. In 2012, Bielema criticized new Ohio State coach Urban Meyer’s widely practiced method of attempting to “flip” recruits, famously declaring that “We at the Big Ten don’t want to be like the SEC — in any way, shape, or form.” Bielema would infamously end up bolting for Arkansas less than a year later, where he presumably remains insecure that Meyer is a far better recruiter. At Arkansas, Bielema fully blossomed into the grade-A troll that he is today. He’s feuded with too many SEC coaches to name, generally due to his self-serving and baseless contention that hurry-up offenses pose a serious player-safety risk. However, it was his wife, Jen, who caused his greatest controversy to date with the Razorbacks. As you surely remember, Wisconsin got utterly jobbed by the notoriously awful Pac-12 officials in a 2013 game against Arizona State — so much so that the refs faced sanctions afterward: That’s not how Jen saw it, though. On the contrary, Jen genuinely believed that Badgers fans were receiving a well-deserved dose of karmic retribution from the football gods, apparently because they weren’t pleased with the way Bert handled his departure from Wisconsin. While she quickly deleted this tweet, #karma has lived on as a meme in the college football Twittersphere, and it never gets old. In fact, it started trending in Columbus, of all places, moments after Toledo sealed its 16-12 upset of the Razorbacks. Jen’s mentions have been a sight to behold over the past few days. So, when Arkansas takes on Texas Tech on Saturday in a must-win game for Bielema, remember that it is your moral duty as a discerning college football fan to root for Kingsbury’s Red Raiders, your imperative to root against Bielema and his bullying ways. Bert is many things: a frat bro who never grew up, a troll with a persecution complex, and an opportunistic propagandist, and he deserves your scorn. If Bert wanted to face a Big Ten schedule, he should have stayed at Wisconsin! Nobody forced him to move to Fayetteville.

401,"Influential Emirati Business Leader And Commentator: ""Iran Deal Goes From Risky To Farcical"" HT: Memri.
At First, ""I Shrugged Off The News"" Of The Secret Agreement ""As A Figment Of Someone's Heated Imagination""
In his August 25 article, Al-Habtoor wrote:
""When I first learned from the news that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had signed a secret agreement permitting Iran to self-monitor at least one of its major nuclear sites, I shrugged off the news as a figment of someone's heated imagination.
""It is inconceivable that the world's nuclear watchdog, known for its professionalism and stringent monitoring, would sign off on something so bizarre – or so I initially believed.
""Iraq, whose nuclear activities, both civilian and military, were dismantled following the Gulf War, certainly did not get off that lightly. Even after years of intrusive inspections, the IAEA under the directorship of Mohammed ElBaradei declined to present Iraq's deserved clean bill of health to the UN Security Council prior to the US-led invasion.
""Yet the Islamic Republic of Iran, that has been spinning thousands of centrifuges to enrich uranium beyond accepted civilian levels and has refused to come clean on its past activities in this sphere, is trusted to inspect itself.
""The IAEA cannot be accused of lacking innovation. Perhaps we will soon see drivers suspected of being under the influence allowed to test their own substance levels. Moreover, given that the ayatollahs, whose mantra is 'Death to America,' are suddenly considered trustworthy, years of negotiations could have been avoided. A simple affidavit signed by the Supreme Leader would have sufficed just as well. Something does not smell right here.""
""The Obama Administration's Claim That The U.S. Was Not A Party To This Agreement"" Is ""Just As Fishy"".
""Just as fishy is the Obama administration's claim that the U.S. was not a party to this agreement specific to the Parchin Military Complex – known as Separate Arrangement II – when it was approved by all P5+1 countries.
""A White House spokesman has confirmed the administration is 'comfortable' with the terms of the confidential side agreement between Iran and the IAEA. Are we to suppose that the IAEA took this dangerous, lackadaisical approach off its own bat?
""According to a leaked draft of this 'Separate Arrangement' divulged by the Associated Press, Iran is bound to provide the IAEA with photographs and videos of the various locations within Parchin, together with environmental samples. The question remains, how can those photos, videos and samples be verified as relating to the Parchin complex – and even if they are legit, who is to know whether or not they have been cherry-picked?
""President Obama's assurances that Iran's activities would be subject to 'unprecedented verification' sound ever more hollow. The IAEA has been barred from this site, suspected of carrying out explosives tests related to nuclear weapons, since 2005 and now it has assented to being locked-out for the duration, which is out of character.""
Like Other UN Bodies, The IAEA Too Is Now Politicized.
""This surrender on the part of the IAEA leads me to believe that like so many other UN bodies, the IAEA is politicized; in this case, it has shaped its usual rock-solid strategies to suit political goals. However it is spun, this does not amount to 'the most robust inspection regime' ever, as touted by the Obama administration.
""The AP news report has been slammed by the IAEA as 'misleading.' However, the agency's Director General Yukiya Amano has not disclaimed the draft's published content. He insisted that the arrangements are in conformity with long-established IAEA practices, while emphasizing that he has 'a legal obligation not to make them public.' One is left wondering why the public, not to mention U.S. lawmakers, are being left in the dark.""
""My Suspicions That Iran Is Being Deliberately Empowered To Fit A Geopolitical End-Game Are Heightened"".
""I have been against this unsatisfactory arrangement with Iran since day one, primarily because of its narrow remit. An acceptable deal would have been conditional upon Tehran ceasing its troublemaking and its attempts to topple governments throughout the region.
""My view broadly reflects the opinions of many of Iran's neighbors, who are rightly fearful that the lifting of sanctions will see Iran's coffers overflowing into the hands of its armed proxies.
""President Obama has repeatedly countered our concerns on the grounds that curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions for 10 years is better than no deal. I did not find his arguments credible then, but now that the existence of secret side agreements have come to the fore, my suspicions that Iran is being deliberately empowered to fit a geopolitical end-game are heightened.
""I would love to know why a country that has been hostile to Western powers and their allies since its inception in 1979 is being so rewarded. Or is this animosity with the West just a farce to fool us?""
""Obama Has Been... Bribing America's Middle East Allies, Appealing To The American People, And Playing The Heavy With Congress To Seal His Deal, To The Point Of Being Unseemly – At Stake Is His Legacy""
""European capitals are eyeing up lucrative trade deals and planning to reopen their embassies in Tehran. Iranian-Russian trade is set to expand exponentially... Iran's oil industry is gearing up to expand production of crude to pre-sanctions levels, which could see already depressed oil prices spiraling to new lows.
""Obama's hard-sell campaign is not working, despite his frequent appearances on U.S. news networks to plug the deal for all he is worth, and his furious lobbying of Congress. He has even resorted to pleading with the American people to press their Congressional representatives to vote 'yes,' but is making little headway. A recently released CNN/ORC poll indicates that 56 per cent of Americans want Congress to reject the deal.
""Just about every Republican presidential hopeful – with the exception of Jeb Bush who is on the fence – vows to undo the deal and re-impose sanctions; most of their Democratic rivals are trying to distance themselves from the topic.
""Congress has 60 days to put the issue under a spotlight and is set to vote early next month on a 'Resolution of Disapproval.' If the vote fails to go in the President's favor, in theory Congress could prevent him from lifting sanctions against Iran. Obama has threatened to use his veto, risking putting the White House and Congress on a war footing. It will take a two-thirds majority in Congress to override that veto.
""President Obama has been browbeating and bribing America's Middle East allies, appealing to the American people and playing the heavy with Congress to seal his deal, to the point of being unseemly. At stake is his legacy. It is my hope that America's lawmakers will vote in sufficient numbers to ensure that we in this part of the world are not doomed to pay the price.""[2]
""Europe's Unseemly Haste To Embrace Tehran""
""The Mullahs Have Gone From Zero To Hero In The Blink Of An Eye""
In his August 31 article, Al-Habtoor wrote: ""The ink hardly dried on the Iran nuclear deal before European countries were racing to seal trade deals and reopen embassies. The mullahs have gone from zero to hero in the blink of an eye. Forgotten are Tehran's links to terrorists, attempts to overthrow Middle Eastern governments and mass gatherings organized to hurl insults and threats at the West.
""Cast aside are concerns about Iran's suppression of minorities, its dismal human rights record or its practice of stoning women. I believe Iran has made no substantial statements to the effect it is willing to change. On the contrary, its message throughout has been one of defiance. It has not been required to denounce terrorism let alone its participation in terrorist acts.
""Iran's crimes are suddenly of no consequence to Europe's democracies; I believe they have purposefully put their blinkers on and are literally queuing with their hands out to beat down Tehran's golden doors. All they see now are flashing neon dollar signs. The Islamic Republic, soon to be flush with an $80 billion plus bonanza, is destined to become Europe's latest cash cow.
""I was extremely disappointed and saddened at Britain's rush to reopen its Tehran embassy that has been closed for four years subsequent to coming under mob attack in November, 2011. I have always had great respect and admiration for the UK that I consider my second home, based on my homeland's historic ties and the principled stances taken by great leaders like Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher, who kept the 'Great' in Britain, politically, militarily, industrially and economically.
""I cannot imagine that those prime ministers, whose names remain engraved on world history to this day, groveling before a country that five minutes ago was their enemy, just to get their clutches on a fistful of dollars.""
""Iran's Crimes Are Suddenly Of No Consequence To Europe's Democracies; They Have Purposefully Put Their Blinkers On"" ""The UK's Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, was the first to beat a track to Tehran since 2003. Naturally, he arrived with a trade delegation and took the opportunity to stress the 'huge appetite' shown by British business to invest in Iran as well as the readiness of British banks to finance deals.
""As the Iranian network Press TV has reported, Iran has recently hosted 'a delegation of government ministers from Italy,' who has signed a Memorandum of Understanding to fund industrial, construction and infrastructure projects worth over 3 billion euros. This comes on the heels of a visit by Germany's Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy, Sigmar Gabriel, with a team of manufacturers, as well as visits from Austrian, Serbian, Swiss and Azerbaijani government officials. Spain is also champing at the bit to board the gravy train.
""Moreover, President Hassan Rohani has been invited to visit Rome 'in the coming weeks'. Rohani's red carpet travel schedule is getting fuller by the day. Following a visit to Tehran by France's Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Development, Laurent Fabius, accompanied by business leaders, he has been invited to visit the Elysees Palace in November. Russia and China, which have always been cosy with Tehran, are waiting in the wings with lucrative energy and weapons contracts at the ready.
""No doubt President Barack Obama is rubbing his hands together awaiting his turn to get in on the action, delayed by pesky lawmakers who refused to take his word that his deal is the best thing that has happened since the invention of the wheel.
""Iran and its Lebanese proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah, have not changed. Nevertheless, America inexplicably saw it fit to remove those entities from its terror threat list even as it is fighting to preserve Syria's Killer-in-Chief and supporting a Houthi takeover of Yemen.
""At least one senior Iranian official has gleefully announced his country's continued support for 'resistance' groups, which translated means their armed minions and spies targeting Arabian Gulf States. Who can blame Iran's Arab neighbors for being rattled when a massive cache of weapons were recently discovered in Kuwait in the hands of a Hezbollah cell poised to create mayhem and bloodshed!...""
""A 'Grand Bargain' Between The West And Iran Is Unfolding Before Our Eyes"".
""I am starting to wonder whether there is more to the nuclear deal, which permits Iran to carry out self-inspections of its suspect Parchin Military Complex, than meets the eye - especially when there are other secret agreements between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency which the nuclear watchdog is legally bound not to disclose, even to the U.S. and the other P5+1 countries. Believe that if you will!
""In this case, one can only speculate about the existence of other secret arrangements between Iran and the Obama administration that has displayed unprecedented determination to ensure the deal passes muster with Congress and has gone to extreme lengths to persuade America's longstanding Middle East allies to come on board, including invitations to the leaders of Gulf States to weekend talks at Camp David. Likewise, President Obama is trying, unsuccessfully, to bribe the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu into silence with a massive 'military compensation package.'
""The Shah of Iran may have sat on the Peacock Throne, but it is my bet that Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Hosseini Khamenei is strutting around like a peacock these days, his feathers plumped up by European sycophants and endless praise from U.S. officials.
He is getting everything for nothing. Iran's nuclear infrastructure remains intact, uranium enrichment will be ongoing. Opening up some of the country's nuclear facilities, barring military sites, to intrusive inspections for 10 years is just a mere inconvenience paling by comparison with the glittering rewards.
""I warned again and again of the potential of a 'Grand Bargain' being struck between the West and Iran many years ago and now it is unfolding before our eyes. I recall President Obama saying the nuclear deal could possibly lead to normalization of relations with Iran way into the future provided it sticks to its commitments. What is happening now makes a mockery of those cautious words.
""Here is another prediction. Those Western leaders prostrating themselves before the Iranian leadership will live to rue the day. Enriched and emboldened, I believe it is only a matter of time before Tehran strikes at their countries interests because its ideology and hatred for all things western are immutable.
""The Arab World, in particular Iran's closest neighbors, the Arabian Gulf states, must not only be alert to the coming danger, but should take a leaf out of Donald Trump's book by erecting an impenetrable wall in terms of military, surveillance and intelligence capabilities, to keep Iran, its mercenaries and proxies far from our shores. If we are not careful, the West's lust to bolster their failing economies will leave us hung out to dry."" [3]

342,"Organisers of the September 16 rally selling red T-shirts for RM10 each outside PWTC. — Pix by Kamles Kumar KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 9 — As Umno’s powerful supreme council members are locked in a meeting in the headquarters at Menara Dato Onn here this afternoon, organisers of the controversial September 16 rally have opened up a stall outside the adjoining Putra World Trade Centre selling red T-shirts promoting a “Malay dignity uprising”. 
 
Sales of the tees costing RM10 each appear to be brisk. According to one of the sales team, over 5,000 have been sold, and orders are coming in for another 2,000 red shirts to be picked up later. 
 
But who is the September 16 rally organiser? Datuk Jamal Md Yunus (in black suit with specs) holds up a red T-shirt that reads in Bahasa Malaysia: Malay dignity uprising, Padang Merbok, Bukit Bintang, Petaling Street, My Homeland. 
 
According to Datuk Jamal Md Yunos who heads a self-styled coalition of Malay non-government organisations that is facilitating sales of the red T-shirts and will help to mobilise participation on that day, the organiser is a little-known Malay rights group called Pesaka. 
 
“The rally organiser is Pesaka. We’re just helping with mobilising the rally,” Jamal who is also Sungai Besar Umno division chief told Malay Mail Online when met at the booth sale. 
 
Jamal added that the group has received over 600,000 orders for the T-shirts nationwide and is expected to sell 30,000 over this weekend. 
 
“We have over 5,000 shirts printed and ready to be sold. We have got overwhelming response with pre-orders reaching thousands coming in. We think we need to print more,” he told reporters who had turned up to cover the Umno supreme council meeting. 
 
Jamail said the earlier batch was sold out because of the outpouring of support from Malaysians to join the rally. 
 
“The orders keep coming in. Hope we can sell all by the time the rally happens. Now we have got itself over 600,000 nationwide from various groups who are helping to sell the T-shirt,” he explained. 
 
Major Razali Zakaria from another Malay movement called GMPN said his NGO had already ordered over 1,000 pieces of T-shirts ahead of the upcoming rally on September 16. 
 
“A lot of my members have expressed interest to purchase this T-shirt. That’s why I am here to buy them before they run out of stock,” he told the Malay Mail Online when approached. Major Razali Zakaria (left) of GMPN says his group is buying 1,000 pieces of the T-shirts for the rally. 
 
The September 16 rally had raised a storm after word of it spread on social media networks in recent days, but no one had owned up as its organiser till now. 
 
The rally, which has also been called the “Dignity Association of Indonesia”, has received unofficial support from some government officials, including Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and Domestic Trade, Cooperatives and Consumerism Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob. 
 
It is ostensibly in reaction to the Bersih 4 protest on August 29 and 30, and is touted to see a turnout of 300,000 supporters. 
 
But not all of Umno is supportive of the September 16 rally. 
 
It was criticised yesterday by former international trade and industry minister Tan Sri Rafidah Aziz, who dubbed it an instigation to racialisation with its call for Malays, especially those from the country’s ruling party, to unite against the DAP and organisers of Bersih 4. 
 
Police have prohibited the rally but Umno-linked newspaper Utusan Malaysia in its weekend edition last Sunday pressed the authorities to allow the rally to take place, saying it was necessary to counter what it dubbed as the Chinese-dominated Bersih 4 rally. 
 
Election watchdog Bersih 2.0 organised the street overnight on August 29 and 30 to demand for electoral reforms as well as the resignation of Datuk Seri Najib Razak as prime minister owing to a controversy surrounding his receipt of a RM2.6 billion donation from the Middle East.

4164,"How I “cooked” with @CHEF_LYNN
Life is good. Today is, of course, the 22nd anniversary of the official recognition of the baguette (thanks Mother Google), and I’m just back from the first ever Scottish Salmon Festival in Inverness. As noted in my last column, I took the opportunity of being in Scotland to partake of three splendid and educational tours: at the Scotch Whisky Experience in Edinburgh, and Glenfiddich and Abelour distilleries in the Highlands. I’ll be writing about them later and will provide links once the piece is published.
Re-entry to the Southern Ontario food scene was swift. I received an invitation to participate in the 5th Stein and Dine in Waterloo. The main draw was Pitchin’ In star and Chopped Canada Judge Chef Lynn Crawford. (Readers may recall Food for Thought covered Crawford’s appearance at Denninger’s Diamond Anniversary about a year ago, but was unable to secure an interview at that time.)
The Waterloo gig was clearly going to be my chance!
In many ways the Kitchener-Waterloo food and drink scene is poised to take off the way Hamilton-Burlington has prospered during the past three years. KW has long been known for the bounteous St Jacob’s Farmers’ Market, and hosting what National Geographic crowned the best Oktoberfest outside of Munich, Germany. But there’s a lot else going on these days, with fine culinary talent being attracted to the area, new breweries abounding (as befits the area’s Germanic origins) and active social media devoted to the topic. I’ve often directed readers south toward St. Kits, Niagara and Halton: I can heartily recommend going a bit further northward as well. Dave MacNeil, Executive Director of Kitchener-Waterloo Oktoberfest told me the festival now counts four silos: Cultural and family activities, Sports, Business to Business, and Culinary. They’ve brought food “front and center” and while “there has always been the traditional foods like schnitzel, and sausage on a bun available at the fest halls, there will be more food events than ever this year.” There will be a Taste of Oktoberfest culinary series featuring Bavarian-inspired menus and beer pairings, Oktoberlicious (think Taste of Burlington’s prix-fixe menu program), and Oktoberfeast, a food truck gathering with trucks from all over Ontario. For full details see the Oktoberfest website. So there I was at the culinary kickoff, Stein and Dine, for a dinner prepared by Chef Lynn and the staff of the Waterloo Inn. When I finally got to eat it, it was pretty tasty. “My” salad with beer-pickled beets was light and well dressed. A trout schnitzel with pilsner remoulade was a standout, perfectly cooked, quite the trick given the number of portions served. The Applewood-smoked pork chop with sausage gravy was very tender and accompanied by an unusual side: a ham hock, apple and sauerkraut bread pudding.
Dessert was a signature dish from Crawford’s restaurant, Ruby Watchco, a sweet pretzel streusel with airy pumpkin cheesecake, served in a small mason jar. Each of the dishes were well-paired with a Molson product (Creemore Springs lager and pilsner, and Rickard’s Red and White) by Justin Lamontagne, one of only 8 Cicerones (think beer sommeliers) in Canada. You’ll note I said “My” salad. Yes indeed, I ended up on stage, endured a Survivor-style elimination (see photo by Sylvia Pond Photography), and was dressed by Chef so I could prep the salad with her. That involved more of the same, i.e. no, as in zero, handling of food, except for pieces of pickled beet stuffed in my mouth and a bit of jar shaking. Now I admit I had provoked Chef with my comment about silly hats (see photos again), and fully deserved the continuous ribbing I took from her, to the delight of the crowd. I departed the stage arms full: a jar of brown derby dressing, a spoon, a chef’s hat, a cleaning cloth, her book (At Home with Lynn Crawford), and a tube of Rub A535 to soothe my aching arms. As I said later on Twitter, I’m expecting the offers to come rolling in from the fest halls now I’ve proved my mettle as a beer carrier.
The thing I did not leave the event with was an interview with Chef Crawford. Third time lucky? To see more pictures, click here.

43,"Taking calcium supplements or eating more dairy to improve bone health has little or no effect, according to new research. 

There is scant evidence that taking calcium supplements prevents fractures and no evidence that increasing calcium through the diet prevents fractures or breaks either, experts said. 

The research, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), collected data from dozens of studies on the issue. 

According to the NHS, adults need 700mg of calcium a day. It is recommended that people get all the calcium they need from their daily diet. 

The NHS Choices website warns that taking  high doses of calcium (over 1,500mg a day) could lead to stomach pain and diarrhoea. 

It says taking supplements containing less than this amount are unlikely to cause any harm. 

In the latest study, experts from New Zealand concluded that efforts to increase calcium intake to improve bone health had no overall effect. 

""Our analyses indicate that dietary calcium intake  is not associated with risk of fracture, and there is no evidence  currently that increasing dietary calcium intake prevents  fractures,"" they said. 

They said calcium supplements have "" an unfavourable  risk:benefit profile"", meaning they could do more harm than good. 

""Collectively, these results suggest that clinicians, advocacy  organisations, and health policymakers should not recommend  increasing calcium intake for fracture prevention, either with  calcium supplements or through dietary sources."" 

The experts studied a range of trials on the issue, including people aged 50 and over getting their calcium from milk or dairy, or taking calcium supplements with or without vitamin D. 

In an accompanying editorial, Professor Karl Michaelsson from Uppsala University in Sweden, said  most over-50s will not benefit from increasing their intake of calcium, particularly through supplements, as some recommendations suggest. 

""The weight of evidence against such mass medication of older people is now compelling, and it is surely time to reconsider these controversial recommendations,"" he said. 

Professor Juliet Compston, a National Osteoporosis Society trustee, said:  ""There is not much in these studies that is new. We already know that calcium supplements increase bone density, but on their own do not reduce fractures. 

""However, a recent analysis concluded that calcium and vitamin D did reduce hip and non-vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women and older men.""",adbc107f-4d15-4433-8c56-fd22cc0b1c36,News,2015-09-29T22:30:49Z,Jersey Evening Post,Calcium supplements 'have little effect on bone health',0.0,Blog

1565,"Costco Customer Experience Example  
It was an ordinary work day filled with phone conferences and content creation. Hours spent on the phone and on my computer all focused on teaching companies how to make more money by building better relationships with their customers. 
 
Imagine my surprise, no delight, when I opened up an ordinary envelope from Costco in the mail. I could feel that there is a card in the envelope so I figured there was a new membership card enclosed. 
 
Instead, there was a letter with a cash card. 
 
Apparently, a shirt that I purchased for my husband for father’s day was in fact not 100% silk as it had been labeled. Costco took the initiative to notify everyone who had purchased this specific shirt and give a $20 cash card for each shirt purchased. They ALSO provided the option to return the shirt as well if we were not satisfied with it. They made sure to include a statement to specify that we were free to keep the cash card even if we decided to return the shirt. 
 
They apologized and expressed appreciation for our continued loyalty. 
 
The first words out of my mouth were “I will continue to do business with Costco FOREVER.” This was amazing. 
 
In a world where companies are quick to hide behind policies, or hide the issue completely, Costco decided to bring it to MY attention and make it BETTER THAN RIGHT before I even knew there was an issue to be concerned about. 
 
This is an example that we should all try to live up to both professionally and personally. It’s a simple premise really. Just be forthcoming and honest with your customers and they’ll appreciate it. Do it well, and they’ll be loyal to you. 
 
Now, I fully understand that there is likely a backstory that I’m sure involved a lot of rigmarole (yes, that’s how you spell it, I looked it up) and hard decisions. This is an especially notable response to the issue since I don’t remember this shirt costing a full $ 20. But the company made the decision to stand behind their products, found that this one didn’t measure up to what had been advertised, and took more than full responsibility for it. As a consumer, I really do appreciate that. 
 
As a Customer Experience Expert, I’m so delighted to see large companies setting the example. It truly comes down to the premise I try to live by.

439,"""What needs to be done to reduce record levels of youth unemployment, and how can we ensure that the young are equipped for the world of work?"" That was the question we asked ourselves this week, when 15 young people from the North East came to Brussels to hear what the European Parliament and Commission are doing to support their generation. 

'Youth Unemployment: What needs to be done?' was an ambitious initiative led by myself and two colleagues from the Socialists and Democrats group in the European Parliament, Miapetra Kumpula-Natri MEP from Finland and Eva Kaili MEP from Greece. With a fifth of young people currently out of work in Europe and rates as high as over 50% in Greece, Spain and Italy, youth unemployment is the most pressing challenge facing young people today, and improving the lives and prospects of the young is increasingly high on the agenda for the European Parliament and Commission. It is with this goal in mind that a 45-strong group of 18-25 year olds from the UK, Finland and Greece were invited to Brussels on Tuesday 15 September. 

But this was not an occasion for European policymakers simply to congratulate themselves on their successes thus far, or to provide lectures on the core initiatives aimed at improving young people's lives and job prospects. Central to our aims was to hear the first-hand experience of young people from three countries, each with very different struggles and successes: presentations on long-term youth unemployment, precarious work and youth entrepreneurship, led by Greece, the UK and Finland respectively, formed the backbone of our afternoon's discussions, providing much needed clarity to the challenges that lie ahead. 

While youth unemployment is relatively stable and in general only temporary in Finland - hailed as the beacon for the implementation of the now Europe-wide Youth Guarantee - the UK government continues to refuse to implement a British equivalent, despite calls to the contrary from the European Commission, House of Lords , trade unions and civil society organisations. Yet under 25s in the UK are now more than three times more likely to be out of work than older generations, with more than a third subjected to the now infamous 'zero-hours' contracts plighting the lives of so many struggling to make ends meet. And the desperate situation facing young Greeks, as their country attempts to rebuild from the rubble of an ongoing economic crisis, is by now a familiar tale. The young in Greece have been the most adversely affected by the economic crisis in Europe: youth unemployment was at 50.1% in January this year, while one third of Greek youths are out of work for more than a year. It was a great privilege to be able to bring together young people from these three corners of today's EU, and to hear the lived experience behind the statistics. 

Clearly our work is far from done, however unfortunately it is an all-too rare sight to witness a discussion between a large group of young Europeans and experts from the Commission, European Parliament, trade unions and pan-European youth organisations. So much of European legislation has a top-down approach that fails to involve the very people whose lives it will affect. This is no more so the case than when it comes to the young. 

We want this to change, and will turn our words into actions: as such, the views of our young participants will be collated into a report that will be submitted to the Parliamentary committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the European Commission. As MEP for the region worst affected by youth unemployment in the country , I consider it my responsibility to make sure these voices are heard by the people that can make a real difference: last Tuesday was simply the start of that process.

A spokesman for the agency said the incident occurred around 8 a.m., Sept. 1, on Deer Hollow Drive in Woodstock. 
 
The vehicle was described by investigators as being a two-door, white SUV with possible red paint, rust or red dirt at the bottom of the driver’s side door. The vehicle, authorities said, resembles a Mercury Mountaineer or Ford Explorer, and could have black rims and a slight tint on the windows. 
 
Officials with the sheriff’s office described the driver as being a white man with short gray hair. 
 
“He was described as not having any facial hair; however, he was wearing sunglasses with a circular frame,” Cpl. Darin Downey said. “The driver did have a black tattoo on his left bicep that is described as a possible tribal tattoo.”

2095,"Havana (AFP) - Cuba has decided to allow doctors who deserted while on foreign missions to return home without punishment or loss of position in the state health care system, the government said Friday.

The action comes amid worries of a brain drain of Cuban medical professionals as the Communist-ruled island loosens long-time restrictions on emigration.

Doctors in particular have faced stringent restrictions on travel since the 1960s, and stiff sanctions awaited those who deserted from government-sponsored missions in foreign countries.

Under the new policy announced by the ministry of public health, doctors who deserted while on foreign missions are being welcomed back.

They ""have the opportunity, if they so desire, to rejoin our National Health System, and will be guaranteed work placement in conditions similar to those they had before,"" a ministry statement said.

Likewise, Cuban doctors who have emigrated under a more open policy introduced in 2013 can also return, although with no guarantee of working for the state system.

In the past, deserters and emigres alike were barred from visiting the country for periods of five to 10 years, or even for life in some cases.

An estimated 25,000 doctors and a similar number of health professionals currently serve in international missions in 68 countries.

But the missions have been plagued by complaints about low pay and defections.

In recent weeks, about 100 medical deserters turned up in Colombia seeking to travel to the United States under a program adopted in 2006 during the administration of George W. Bush.

Cuba insists it still has one of the highest doctor-patient ratios in the world.

The island receives about $10 billion a year for the medical services it provides other countries, mainly Brazil and Venezuela, making it the top source of hard currency revenues.",920df132-a770-4bc0-bdf1-665c1c2a7279,News,2015-09-04T16:18:17Z,Yahoo!

5892,"MONTREAL – NDP Leader Tom Mulcair is promising to boost the aerospace industry, a sector that has seen hundreds of layoffs this year. 
 
Mulcair said Tuesday he would set up a $160-million, four-year fund to help small- and medium-sized aerospace companies adopt new technology and increase production in an effort to better compete globally. 
 
The plan would require firms to show a plan to create jobs and provide professional training to workers. 
 
Mulcair also committed to setting aside $40 million over four years in the Canadian Space Agency’s space technology development program to help companies commercialize new technologies. 
 
He said he would also lead trade delegations to help promote Canada’s aerospace industry. 
 
“Canadian aerospace innovators and manufacturers need a prime minister in Ottawa who will be a champion for the them on the world stage — and I will be that champion,” said Mulcair, who was campaigning in Montreal, a hub for the aerospace sector that hosts the headquarters of companies including Bombardier and CAE.

5491,"Boom on the Rose: Hayne caps huge preseason by decking Chargers CB By Eric Branch on September 4, 2015 12:05 AM Jarryd Hayne ended the preseason with a bang.	49ers0904
Niners running back Jarryd Hayne levels Chargers cornerback Lowell Rose at the end of a 12-yard reception Thursday. (Scott Strazzante/The Chronicle) Just ask Chargers cornerback Lowell Rose. Hayne, 6-foot-2, and 220 pounds, lowered the boom on Rose (6-1, 192) at the end of a 12-yard reception in the third quarter of the 49ers’ 14-12 win over San Diego on Thursday night. Hayne remained upright. Rose did not. And the players on the 49ers sideline, who had a front-row seat to the collision, erupted. What did head coach Jim Tomsula see from his vantage point? “I’m not going disrespect any other player,” Tomsula said. “But I can tell you, Jarryd is a tough guy.” And he’ll also be a part of the 53-man roster, which will be made official when the 49ers pare the roster from 75 to 53 players by 1 p.m. Saturday. The former Australian rugby league star capped a surprisingly sensational summer with a strong all-around performance. He rushed for 58 yards on 10 carries, had two receptions for 17 yards and returned three punts for 43 yards. He also sprinted downfield and dropped Javontee Herndon for a one-yard loss after a 39-yard punt by Bradley Pinion. Hayne finished the preseason ranked second in the NFL in rushing yards (175) and he averaged a league-best 7.0 yards a carry. He also averaged 18.1 yards on nine punt returns and had a 33-yard kickoff return. He also learned how to lower his shoulder – unfortunately for Rose.	“You know, technique and just working every week about lowering my pads and playing through someone,” Hayne said. “To understand it tonight and really lower my pads, it was exciting.” Hayne wasn’t the only returner to excel. Rookie wide receiver DeAndrew White had a 36-yard punt return, while wideout Bruce Ellington had a 26-yard return and another runback of about 60 yards nullified by a penalty. Ellington handled kick returns last year as a rookie and he hopes to reprise the role this season. However, he seems to understand Hayne is likely to assume that duty. “He can help us a lot,” Ellington said. “He knows how to set it up and make big plays. Special teams, that’s something we didn’t have last year. So I think with him, he can help us out a lot.” Twitter: @Eric_Branch	Categories: 49ers Tags: San Francisco 49ers Eric Branch",5a6dd8f7-b02e-4f21-b657-65a449cdc4fc,Blog,2015-09-04T07:05:08Z,Niner Insider,Boom on the Rose: Hayne caps huge preseason by decking Chargers CB,1.0,Blog
1946,"The United States is ready to work with Russia and Iran to defeat the ""apocalyptic"" Islamic State (IS) cult in Syria but Bashar Assad must be deposed, Barack Obama has told world leaders.

Efforts to engage Tehran - a close ally of Assad's regime - in a push to end the protracted civil war have been spurred on by a thaw in relations with the West b ut Iranian president Hasan Rouhani - who is holding talks with David Cameron - has insisted it is essential the regime stays in place. 

President Obama told the United Nations summit in New York the international community must work together to defeat the jihadi group, also known as Isil, that has taken over large parts of Iraq and Syria. 

He said: ""There is no room for accommodating an apocalyptic cult like Isil.""

Mr Cameron is meeting Mr Rouhani on the fringes of the summit in a fresh bid to revive the stalled Syrian peace process.

The Iranian premier earlier told a meeting of scholars and experts: ""If we are to succeed in defeating terrorism, the government in Damascus cannot be weakened. It must be able to carry on the fight."" 

President Obama told the summit that while military action is necessary it is not enough to secure lasting stability. 

""The United States is prepared to work with any nation, including Russia and Iran, to resolve the conflict,"" he added.

""But we must recognise that there cannot be, after so much bloodshed, so much carnage, a return to the pre-war status quo.""

He added: ""Realism dictates that compromise will be required to end the fighting and ultimately stamp out Isil, but realism also requires a managed transition away from Assad and to a new leader.""

President Obama's comments come amid concerns over an unexpected build-up of Russian troops in support of the Moscow-backed Assad regime - which the Kremlin says is the best way to take on IS. 

The conflict - which has cost more than 250,000 lives, left Europe struggling to deal with a huge influx of refugees and enabled the rise of Islamic State extremists - is set to dominate the annual UN General Assembly. 

Mr Cameron hopes to build on the summer signing of an international deal on Iran's nuclear programme to bolster regional support for a political settlement in Syria.

But he was accused by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn of failing to show leadership on the issue by choosing not to address the main UN General Assembly session in person, leaving it to Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond to speak for the UK on Syria.

The Prime Minister will use one-to-one talks with a number of key figures - though not Mr Putin - to press his case that the Syrian president ""can't be part"" of a peaceful solution to the civil war. 

But with Europe increasingly overwhelmed by the upsurge of refugees fleeing the conflict and IS in control of large swathes of the country, he has joined Western allies such as the US and France in signalling a willingness to discuss whether he could play a transitional role.

Speaking to reporters accompanying him on the visit - which will also focus on climate change and new UN development goals - Mr Cameron said it was about ""stepping up"" international efforts to take on the militant threat.

""Assad can't be part of Syria's future. He has butchered his own people. He has helped create this conflict and this migration crisis. He is one of the great recruiting sergeants for Isil,"" he said.

""He can't play a part in the future of Syria and that position hasn't changed.

""Obviously conversations about how we bring about transition are very important and that's what we need to see greater emphasis on.""

3021,"Civicom Marketing Research Services, a global leader in facilitating marketing research using telephone and web-based research tools, now includes gamification tools for its online research platform, Civicom ChatterBox(R). 

Civicom ChatterBox(R), Civicom's enhanced online bulletin board solution , provides clients an easily manageable medium for asynchronous group discussions and online focus groups. It allows respondents to log in and interact with other users virtually as they input their insights over extended timeframes through various in-platform activities. It enables researchers to collect different forms of data with built-in analytic tools that will enable them to extract insights efficiently. 
   
However, a huge challenge remains for both quantitative and qualitative studies - total engagement of participants. As we navigate through the digital age, information is easily and readily accessible for consumption. Social media engagement is at an all-time high with microblogs and quick scroll-throughs as leading platforms, and people now have shorter attention spans, as various times a day they engage in this fast-paced level of consumption of information. As such, it is not unlikely that a study may suffer from disengaged completion and unreliable answers. 

Civicom has taken on this challenge and found gamification as an effective tool in inspiring respondents to proactively participate in a lengthy study. With the use of game components and external motivation in gathering data from respondents, the successful application of gamification is a powerful engagement strategy that influences respondents to commit in a dynamic manner to an activity that otherwise requires strong effort or will. It eliminates the need to keep re-recruiting respondents due to lack of reliable and useful insights, thus saving researchers money in the process. 

The built-in gamification tool in Civicom's ChatterBox(R) platform allows project moderators to set up reward systems. Incentive points can be implemented for accomplishing activities such as ranking items, answering polls, or uploading media. Moderators can also tweak incentive options and allow participants to view their progress through points, as well as a leaderboard accessible by all project participants that inspires competitiveness and thus drives engagement. 

Since the platform's launch, various features and capabilities have been added to Civicom ChatterBox(R), giving researchers leverage and optimizing the platform's usability for effectively conducting studies. Aside from its user-friendly interface and mobile accessibility, the gamification capability is only the latest addition to the platform's wide array of tools that researchers can utilize to ensure successful insight tracking and maximum respondent engagement throughout a study.

1013,"BERLIN -- Crowds greet trainloads of migrants with applause, candy and toys. A provincial town's mayor wants to take in more refugees. Top conservative politicians say Germany needs young immigrants. 
 
It's a contrast with a frosty reception when migrant arrivals in Germany last spiked in the 1990s and mainstream politicians rushed to tighten asylum rules, while the country's top-selling newspaper asked: ""The flood is rising - when will the boat sink?"" 
 
Germany expects 800,000 new migrants to arrive this year, nearly twice the previous record. And while attacks on homes for refugees and anti-migrant protests have caused widespread alarm, the broader atmosphere has been strikingly welcoming - illustrated by the weekend's euphoric scenes in stations from Bavarian metropolis Munich to provincial Saalfeld in which throngs of Germans greeted migrants. 
 
The previous record dates back to 1992, when nearly 440,000 asylum-seekers came as the former Yugoslavia disintegrated - coinciding with a spate of anti-foreigner attacks that shamed Germany. 
 
In perhaps the most notorious incident back then, days of rioting in the eastern city of Rostock saw far-right extremists throw firebombs and stones at a center for refugees, then a neighboring apartment block inhabited by Vietnamese immigrants, as bystanders cheered. 
 
In contrast to the Bild daily's 1992 headline about a sinking boat, the newspaper today has taken a pro-refugee line. A recent Sunday edition led with seven pages of supportive messages from prominent Germans under the headline ""100 voices against hatred of refugees."" 
 
""We stood on the edge of a moral abyss ... and we have moved on as a society,"" said Christoph Rass, an expert on contemporary history at the University of Osnabrueck's Institute for Migration Research and Intercultural Studies. Previous generations of immigrants have found their place in society, Germany has become more prosperous and racism is no longer ""socially acceptable"" in the way it was back then, he said. 
 
Ordinary Germans have been pitching in lately to help refugees. Many went over the weekend to Munich's main station, bringing everything from water to toiletries, as trains with refugees arrived. On Sunday, police tweeted that no more donations were needed at the station, then called for people to donate men's clothing and shoes to a city refugee shelter. Within three hours, no more of those were needed either. 
 
Chancellor Angela Merkel says she is ""proud and grateful to see how countless people in Germany are reacting to the arrival of the refugees."" 
 
These days, politicians stress that the boat isn't full - in fact, it threatens to get worryingly empty due to a demographic crisis brought on by a low birth rate. Increasingly, leaders portray the wave of migrants as an opportunity for Europe's biggest economy. As it stands, deaths outpace births, and the government's statistical office said earlier this year that it expects the population of 80.8 million to shrink by a tenth or more by 2060. 
 
""We are a country of immigration. We need people. We need young people. We need immigrants,"" Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere told visitors to a recent government open day event. ""All of you know that, because we have too few children."" 
 
Oliver Junk, the mayor of Goslar in central Germany, has drawn attention by saying that his town of 50,000 - with a dwindling population and empty housing - could take in more refugees. He argues that ""towns like Goslar have no chance without a long-term influx"" of people. 
 
De Maiziere's description of Germany as a ""country of immigration"" would have been hard to imagine from a leading conservative politician only 15 years ago. 
 
A bitter 1999 state election campaign centered on a conservative drive against allowing dual citizenship for many residents with foreign roots. The following year, an unsuccessful candidate to be governor of Germany's most populous state used the slogan ""Kinder statt Inder,"" or ""children, not Indians"" to argue that Germany should step up its own education rather than bring in foreign computer experts. 
 
Politicians' response to rising asylum applications in the 1990s was ""too many are coming, we'll solve the problem by limiting the right to asylum, then it's dealt with and everyone can sleep easy,"" said Orkan Kosemen, an expert on integration at the Bertelsmann Foundation think-tank. When refugee centers were attacked at the time, there were candlelight vigils and help campaigns but ""the majority was indifferent,"" he said. 
 
An immigration law approved in 2004 sought to balance Germany's need to attract qualified migrants with concerns about matters such as their integration, mandating government-funded German language and civics courses for newcomers. 
 
""Germany has changed mentally in the past 20 years,"" Kosemen said. Immigration has become a less polarizing issue and is no longer considered an exception as it was in the 1990s, he said. 
 
Merkel herself acknowledges that a large population of people with foreign roots has gradually changed Germany, and that the term ""guest workers"" stuck for too long as a term for Turks and others recruited by West Germany as the economy boomed in the 1960s. Many put down roots, and ""fortunately we have for some time come around to seeing that they are our fellow citizens, of whatever origin."" 
 
""The fact that the third or fourth generation is living with us has changed our country,"" she said. Then-President Christian Wulff declared in 2010 that Islam is part of Germany, and Merkel reiterated last week that ""of course it now belongs in Germany."" 
 
Over recent years, even the World Cup-winning national soccer team has become a symbol of a more diverse Germany, with Merkel describing it as an example for the successful integration of immigrants, as ethnic Germans like Bastian Schweinsteiger and Thomas Mueller played alongside stars such as Mesut Ozil, with Turkish roots, and Sami Khedira, whose father is Tunisian. 
 
Stars from the national team have appeared in a video this week to promote tolerance, and leading soccer clubs have joined the effort to help. National champion Bayern Munich is organizing a training camp for migrant children, for example, and Mainz invited hundreds of migrants to its games. 
 
Meantime, many other Germans are doing what they can to pitch in to help migrants. 
 
In Berlin, when film producer Gian-Piero Ringel heard that migrants were standing in long lines for days to register with authorities overwhelmed by the flood, he organized movie-set caterers to provide them with food and drinks. 
 
Sonja Meyer, 26, a trainee teacher, said hundreds of migrants have arrived at a reception center in hear eastern Berlin neighborhood. A local group that helps refugees didn't need any more help, so she took toiletries and diapers to the refugees. 
 
""Of course there are also people who are hostile and say they'll ruin our fences if they lean against them,"" she said. ""And I have a few friends who say poor Germans should be taken care of first, and I find that terrible. ... But most people are helping wonderfully. They are taking refugees into their apartments, offering them rooms and having barbecues for the refugees.""

1981,"The junta-stacked legislature prolongs the junta's rule after the draft constitution was widely criticised. 

Bangkok: Thailand's military has prolonged its direct rule of the country after a junta-stacked legislature voted to reject a new constitution.

The National Reform Council's rejection of Thailand's 20th constitution, by 134 votes to 105, will push back any prospect for elections and a return to civilian rule while the military maintains its firm grip over the country's often turbulent politics.

The military toppled Thailand's democratically-elected government to seize power in May last year.

Military members on the council backed away from endorsing the constitution in response to criticism of it by almost all of Thailand's political parties.

The new charter would have significantly weakened the parties, using a system where it would have been much harder for any one party to win an overall majority, forcing the formation of multi-party coalitions.

But analysts said no matter what the vote, the military would benefit.

If the charter had passed it would have enshrined a military-dominated 23-member politburo-style committee to co-exist alongside parliament that would have had the power for five years to take over at any time in what it deemed a crisis situation.

Borwornsak Uwanno, chairman of the drafting committee, said the proposed body - called the National Strategic Reform and Reconciliation Committee - would be a ""special tool"" to ensure a smooth transition to democracy and prevent future coups.

The ""no"" vote means the process of drafting another constitution will start again, delaying any election until 2017 at the earliest.

The Pheu Thai party, which was ousted from power last year, described the constitution as ""totally disregarding the sovereignty of the Thai people"".

Pheu Thai's rivals in the pro-military Democrat Party called for it to be rejected pending further discussion.

What ordinary Thais thought about it is unknown, because the military did not allow it to be debated.

A small group of protesters who defied orders not to protest were arrested on Sunday.

Thailand is currently using an interim constitution drafted by the junta last year. It gives sweeping unchecked powers to the junta led by former army commander Prayuth Chan-ocha.

Thailand has had on average a new constitution every four years since the end of the absolute monarchy in 1932.

The vote came at a time of unease in the county over the health of 87-year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej, a faltering economy and an unprecedented bombing in central Bangkok on August 17 that killed 20 people and injured 120 others. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.",83f8521d-b116-4791-b8c6-71d7db7e6488,News,2015-09-06T05:57:13Z,Midland Express,'No' vote on constitution pushes Thai elections back to 2017 at earliest,0.0,News

1439,"News Community Students trying to rent apartments for papal visit Landlords are discouraging tenants, but said they can’t monitor every case. by Julie Christie 15 September 2015 With the papal visit drawing closer, some students are renting out their apartments to the influx of tourists who will flock to the city. City officials said about 1.5 million people are estimated to come to Philadelphia for the week-long event. Pope Francis is arriving for the World Meeting of Families, an event run by the Catholic Church featuring speakers on a variety of family-related issues. More than 110 properties around Main Campus are up for rent on Airbnb, an online platform that allows rental of living space on a nightly basis. Prices range from $25 to $3,000 per night. Some students are offering up entire apartments to visitors, while others are renting out couches in their living rooms. Prices are higher at locations closer to the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, where the pontiff will celebrate Mass on Sept. 27. One five-bedroom property near Drexel University  costs $2,150 a night. The average apartment, however, comes out to only $55 more expensive than apartments in the Temple area. Areas near Drexel and Temple have several apartments listed specifically for the papal visit. Most descriptions include assets the apartments can provide for visitors, such as proximity to events and public transportation. Pope Francis is expected to appear at three events over the Sept. 26–27 weekend. The events are located at Independence Hall and the Festival of Families on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. Due to the fact that Airbnb pays its hosts directly to their bank accounts, some landlords may be unaware of what their tenants are doing. Star Bocasan Little, the marketing manager for Temple Town Realty, said renters can have guests, and may make the decision to charge those guests on their own. “It’s technically not in the lease,” she explained. “They don’t have to tell us and we can’t keep track.” Bocasan said as long as there are no complaints and they “don’t have to go knocking on doors,” the company does not monitor the tenants’ actions. Depending on the lease, some students can rent out their spaces, while others are held to a more restricted contract. The View at Montgomery rents most of its spaces to students who attend Temple, but does not allow tenants to rent out apartments to others for short periods of time. “If we find out about it, we tell the renter it’s not allowed and take away their guest privilege,” said Genna Vakin, a community assistant for The View at Montgomery. The View policy dictates that renters are allowed to have a guest stay for three consecutive nights, but must be with the guest at all times while they are in the building.

An Exploration into Fern Genome Space. Genome Biol Evol 7:2533–2544. [ View abstract on publisher’s site ] 
 

  Abstract  
Ferns are one of the few remaining major clades of land plants for which a complete genome sequence is lacking. Knowledge of genome space in ferns will enable broad-scale comparative analyses of land plant genes and genomes, provide insights into genome evolution across green plants, and shed light on genetic and genomic features that characterize ferns, such as their high chromosome numbers and large genome sizes. As part of an initial exploration into fern genome space, we used a whole genome shotgun sequencing approach to obtain low-density coverage (∼0.4X to 2X) for six fern species from the Polypodiales ( Ceratopteris , Pteridium , Polypodium , Cystopteris ), Cyatheales ( Plagiogyria ), and Gleicheniales ( Dipteris ). We explore these data to characterize the proportion of the nuclear genome represented by repetitive sequences (including DNA transposons, retrotransposons, ribosomal DNA, and simple repeats) and protein-coding genes, and to extract chloroplast and mitochondrial genome sequences. Such initial sweeps of fern genomes can provide information useful for selecting a promising candidate fern species for whole genome sequencing. We also describe variation of genomic traits across our sample and highlight some differences and similarities in repeat structure between ferns and seed plants.

Congress leaders face wrath 
 
Before VS reached the venue, the protesting tea plantation workers at Munnar ousted Mahila Congress leaders from the protest venue. 
 
Mahila Congress leaders Bindu Krishna and Lathika Subhash who came to offer solidarity with the workers had to face the wrath of the protesters. The protesters also turned angry at Revolutionary Marxist Party (RMP) leader K.K. Rema who arrived at the venue. 
 
Meanwhile, Youth Congress activists burned Kanan Devan company's tea powder at Kattappana and Kumily. 
 
VS should follow party stance: Rajendran 
 
Devikulam MLA S. Rajendran, who is on a hunger strike in support of the workers, said that V.S. Achuthanandan is supposed to comply with the party stance on Munnar strike. The MLA said he was not eligible to advise VS. ""The party had decided to support the strike,"" he said, adding that he did not wish to react to VS' statement. 
 
Rajendran started a hunger strike near the protest venue announcing solidarity with the protesters, though he was chased away from the venue by the agitating women. The women did not allow Rajendran to enter the venue as he had called the protesters 'Tamil extremists'. 
 
The strike against the Kanan Devan Planatation's policies entered ninth day on Sunday after appeasement talks failed to reach a consensus. The estate workers are planning to continue the strike by blocking all the roads to Munnar.

2548,"A vonlunteer hands over care bags to refugees at the Central Registration Office for Asylum Seekers in Berlin Monday. The numbers of migrants have spiked since Sept. 4, when Austria and Germany threw open their borders and eased travel restrictions to allow in thousands who had made it to Hungary, which has balked at the influx. 
 
Tobias Schwarz, AFP/ 
  
After a weekend in which tens of thousands of Syrian war refugees and other migrants reached Austria and Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel says Germany is putting 6 billion euros ($6.7 billion) toward coping with the influx; France has committed to receiving 24,000 migrants. 

It’s all part of a scramble to accommodate a portion of the more than 322,000 migrants the U.N. says have reached Europe from Syria and other countries, in a humanitarian crisis that has set off tensions between European Union nations. 

In Britain, Prime Minister David Cameron is poised to announce a plan to accommodate Syrian refugees, the BBC  reports. 

Most of the migrants have crossed the Mediterranean Sea, hoping to find safety and the prospect of a brighter future in Europe. So far in 2015, more than 200,000 people have reached Greece and another 100,000 reached Italy, the U.N. says. From Greece, thousands of the arrivals then moved on to Hungary, Macedonia, and Serbia. 

Over the weekend, Germany received an estimated 20,000 people seeking asylum – and with the country expecting as many as 800,000 new arrivals this year, Merkel announced a funding boost Monday. 

From Berlin, Esme Nicholson reports for our Newscast unit: 

“In addition to the provision of extra funds for federal states and town councils, the German government plans to increase the capacity of asylum-seeker reception centers, finance an additional 3,000 federal police officers and invest more in integration and language courses. 

“But there will also be restrictions. Kosovo, Albania and Montenegro will be added to the list of ‘safe’ countries and cash allowances for asylum-seekers will be replaced by goods and services. Speaking to journalists this morning, Merkel stressed that Germany cannot solve these issues alone. 

” ‘The entire EU needs to make an effort. We can’t do this without European solidarity,’ Merkel said. 

On Monday, French President Francois Hollande announced his country will accept 24,000 migrants over the next two years. 

“The EU is pushing its member countries to each take in more migrants, to share the burden with front-line nations such as Italy and Greece,” NPR’s Eleanor Beardsley reports, noting France’s plan. “But other eastern E.U. nations such as Poland and the Czech Republic say setting migrant quotas would be unacceptable.”",8c1392a2-c8c3-4337-8bf5-2b9bcc4680c0,News,2015-09-07T13:55:47Z,Oregon Public Broadcasting,"Germany, France Announce Plans To Welcome Thousands Of Migrants",0.0,News
3081,"Reconstruction of the tunnel that connects the Pruneyard shopping center to Campbell's historic downtown could come to an end by late fall with a little luck. 

The colorfully lit East Campbell Avenue Portals that runs below Highway 17 has been under construction since November and seen sidewalk closures and traffic delays.

""There's still roadwork to be done,"" said city engineer Michelle Quinney. ""My personal goal is to have it done by the end of this year."" 

The tunnel is expected to be safer for pedestrians and bicyclists when fully renovated.

Removal of its interior walls--the largest portion of the project--has been finished, but an issue with utility lines cropped up during construction, according to Quinney. 

She said crews ""ran into a lot of things that were underground,"" particularly utility lines that will need to be relocated.

""We're taking the extra time to make sure the utilities are placed correctly underground,"" Quinney said, adding that the city will work with Caltrans and utility companies to relocate the lines. 

Quinney said she does not expect the lines' relocation to affect the project's budget because money already was allocated for unforeseen issues.

The project's estimated cost is $4.85 million. More than 90 percent of that amount is covered by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission's One Bay Area Grant, Valley Transportation Authority's Bicycle Expenditure Plan and the Transportation Development Act.Other remaining work includes building retaining walls and installing electrical equipment. Occasional pedestrian detours and lane closures for the north and south sides of the area are expected to continue while sidewalks are widened.

""Now that people see the walkway, they're anxious,"" Quinney said. ""It's very tempting to walk through it."" 

Eventually, road markers, pedestrian lighting and public art installations will be installed, Quinney said.

""It will be a nice place to ride your bike and walk through once it's done,"" she said. Any questions or comments on the project should be emailed to publicworks@cityofcampbell.com.

City Youth Rohit Kandakatla elected VP of IFEES at World Engineering Education Forum held in Italy 
   Next story:  
Public WiFi hotspots to be expanded: PM Mumbai: Author Mamta Bhatt of the  “Warriors of Kurukshestra” book fame is back, with her second book “The Eternal Hero – Ram”. On the lines of WOK, the second offering from the author too, is keeping in mind young readers of the age group of 9- 14 yrs. 
 
The unveiling of the book took place at Shanmukhanand Audi, Sion, Mumbai and over 1200 people applauded and cheered as the young author announced her second offering. It was a musical and fun filled event with Actor Nana Patekar, Hockey Star Mir Ranjan Negi, followed by power packed and soothing performances by Singing Maestros Anup Jalota & Suresh Wadkar amongst others, the evening was hosted by the ever resonating voice,  Harish Bhimani. 
 
The Author was overwhelmed to receive a wonderful response from the audience and exclaimed her thoughts by saying, “I received an overwhelming response from thousands of readers and fans from all over the country. Some after reading the book and some, who were witness to my reading sessions on the great epic. I always looked up to our great Indian epics and feel, the energy, the wisdom, the learnings that we can obtain from these, can be matched by no other medium.” 
 
About the Author: 
 
Mamta works as the Director – Legal with the BJN Group for the last 10 yrs and has been closely involved in the expansion of the group hotel chains all over the country. Having a total corporate experience of over 20 yrs and having worked with several law firms prior to this and being a practicing advocate, Mamta completed her graduation from the University of Mumbai with dual degrees in B.A, LLB. Mamta hails from Uttarakhand and Rishikesh is her hometown. 
 
Being a lawyer, writing comes naturally to me. All the while drafting legal documents and writing legal articles, I didn’t think that one day I would be writing stories of the Mahabharat and Ramayan for children. Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, my hometown where the magical moments spent in my childhood by the river Ganga, deeply immersed in reading the great epics to my siblings remained with me through the years. The childhood passion of storytelling resurfaced as I wanted to share the values taught by the great epics. My bookworm son, Shaan was 12 when he first discovered stories from the Mahabharat, and stumbled upon stories of Dronacharya, Arjun and Bhim. After devouring these stories, he decided to read the entire Mahabharata. Our search for a version of the epic that was apt for young readers were either a 100-page book or that was a little lengthy and complex for children of this age group. The thought that our children want to read the stories of our tradition led me to this pursuit… In that same quest, I present my second book “An Eternal Hero – Ram”. It’s the story of Ramayan, and attempts to bridge the ever-growing gap between today’s generation and ancient Indian stories and values. The story teaches us important life lessons without us realizing it. You begin to identify with the characters. The plot, subplots and events have interesting scenes where the truth about human nature in the game of karma, choices, and destinies are showcased. Throughout the plot, you will see that Gods, demons, humans and the other species being driven by their egos. Only to realize that the only power that can bring justice and wellbeing for all is the Supreme One!

2151,"Whenever a presidential candidate (or anyone, really) decides to host a Q&A on Twitter, it's always going to be full of smart alecks thinking of a funny tweet instead of wanting earnest answers. Case in point: during Donald Trump's #AskTrump hashtag today, I asked the GOP frontrunner candidate and real life Scrooge McDuck what he thought of Lana Del Rey's highly-curated persona and how it relates to pop music's fascination with artificiality. As of press time, Trump has not answered the question but he did respond to another jokester with total sincerity. 

When the dude asked, ""Is Joe Flacco an elite quarterback?"" the Trump-meister said, yes, of course he is! While that seems like a surface-level innocuous question, over the years the topic has become a meme, a way to make fun of sports news outlets like ESPN for their redundant coverage of Baltimore Ravens football and its middle-of-the-road quarterback.

5359,"Interbike 2015: Wethepeople, Eclat, Salt Plus, Fuse Protection
Posted: September 17th, 2015
   ⤹ Please share!
Next up, we made our way over to the Wemakethings booth to visit our good friends from Germany and to get a full look at what they have cooking for Wethepeople, Eclat, Salt Plus and Fuse Protection (We’ll have a separate post for Almond Footwear next)! As always, they always have a TON of new products to check out, so let’s see all of the BMX goodness!
The new Alex Kennedy signature AK Guard Sprocket features a nylon removable guard that can be rotated and changed out. Definitely a unique design and it makes it easier and more affordable than replacing your entire sprocket after a lot of grinding.
The new Bruno Hoffman grip that is in the works. It features a mushroom style pattern but the ribs are offset thickness to give it a softer feel. It also features the Cologne skyline which is a nice touch.
Here’s a sample of a new tire they’re working on. I want to say this is a Bruno Hoffmann tire, but I might be wrong. Took in a lot of info for their new line.
The new Cortex freecoaster is a new addition to the Eclat line. It features a clutch system but it’s different than the KHE design. Expect more details closer to its release.
Hub guards to fit all of the Eclat and Wethepeople hubs.
The Blind freecoaster got a little bit of an update after having issues with the spring they originally used. Now they have individual springs on each pawl to resolve the problem.
Eclat and Wethepeople have a number of new stems, most of which utilize these small cuts to give the bars a little more to grab on to.
The latest version of Sean Burns’ signature stem.
Can’t go wrong with a metal pedal. They have made the ends stick out a little further to protect the outside end of the pedal for this year.
That new camo color looks good.
The Alex Kennedy pedal which eliminates bearings and uses an over sized spindle should be out soon.
Another look at the AK sprocket.
The Universal guard that fits over the outside of the drop out.
New black and anodized silver color looks so good.
The Brock Olive signature bars from Eclat are big and strong. They use straight gauge tubing to keep it strong throughout.
New seat color options.
The new tan peg color for the Eclat plastic pegs.
New purple colorway on their new rim.
Here’s a look at two of the new rims that Eclat are working on. Not the best photo, but we’ll be hearing more soon.
Red, black and polished will be the main focus colors, but there are a few others that will be available as well.
Go through a lot of wax? This new block of wax comes with a few blocks all connected and wrapped up tight like a burrito. Break a piece off, drop it in the session bag and go get your grind on.
Eclat Pulse hubs in red.
Here’s a look at the latest version of the Grippin’ tire to give you street guys plenty of grab.
The Feelin’ tire has been gaining popularity so they have made it a little bigger to give you even more grip.
Here’s a prototype Wethepeople 4-piece bar that utilizes the new 25.4mm diameter tubing at the clamping area that tapers to a regular size at the grips.
Tripod and Pivotal seat options from Wethepeople.
Here’s a look at a new 2-piece crank that Wethepeople are working on. This is a true 2-piece because the arm is welded to the spindle eliminating the extra material needed when you have a 3 or 2.5-piece design. Those pedal and spindle gussets look good.
Ed Zunda signature 2.5 piece cranks in the works. You know if Ed’s name is on it, it will be sturdy!
Wethepeople have a new top load stem that will be available with 3 different rises and 3 different color options. So, yeah, 12 options total to choose from. They also utilize the ridges to keep your bars from slipping.
Clean new sprocket. Nice and simple.
The reptile grip.
The Helix freecoaster has a slimmer shell and a new hub guard to keep it from breaking.
They have made it so these hub guards come with all the different cones for all their different hubs to ensure compatibility. Pretty rad.
They have been working on an updated version of their cassette with a 15mm female axle and bearings to go with the Q-Lite driver.
Tripod and Pivotal post.
The Mike Curley signature Switch fork looking dialed with the CNC machined drop outs that are inserted into the legs and welded, tapered legs and the boxed steer tube / leg junction. Clean and sturdy.
The new Dillon Lloyd signature Buck frame.
Ed Zunda’s new signature frame!
Fresh paint on Dan Foley’s Cadence frame.
Patron and Scorpio frame.
18″ Envy frame and fork for the young guns.
They have beefed up the Utopia frame a bit to be more for the flatland / street guys versus just flatland. That green color looks amazing too.
Dillon Lloyd Buck bars have 25.4mm clamping area and the traditional size. Dillon runs the bigger version for those of you wondering.
Sterling four-piece bars. Straight gauge tubing, 25.4mm clamping area and wider radius bends.
Digging that new tan colorway for the Patron frame. The Patron fork will match that color as well.
Patron stems.
New barends made from stainless steel. Looks good!
If you notice… the 30 tooth is coming back!
Wethepeople have a HUGE range of completes from the 12″ bikes all the way up to the top of the line 20″ as expected and these bikes are DIALED.
Fuse Protection helmet and pads. Those shin pads with the longer top to partially cover the knee are rad.
The new Delta bike bag from Fuse. Learn more about that here — Fuse Protection – Delta Bike Bag
Wrist wraps!
Floor and hand pumps to keep those tires filled.
New Salt Plus tire. Similar to the Eclat Fireball, but more affordable.
Salt Plus freecoaster. Similar design as the new Eclat freecoaster, but with a regular axle, bolts, etc. to help keep the costs down. This is available as a complete wheel as well.
Digging that black and blue swirl color on the Salt Plus stem.
New mushroom style grip.
Salt Plus Chain Breaker!
Salt Plus 4-piece bars.
Regular and guard sprocket. That black and blue swirl to match the stem.
Woof! That was A LOT to cover! If you have any questions, let us know in the comments below. That wraps up Wethepeople, Eclat, Salt Plus and Fuse Protection!

435,"The Cleveland Cavaliers and restricted free agent Tristan Thompson are still at an impasse on a new contract with training camp starting this week. 

Thompson missed the team's media day on Monday. 

The Cavs did not accept Thompson's most recent offer of a three-year maximum contract that his side proposed last week, according to ESPN.com. Thompson likely will miss the start of practice on Tuesday. 
 
""We love Tristan Thompson and we want him to be part of our future,"" general manager David Griffin said Monday. ""I think everything in our actions and our offer indicate that. ... We're excited about moving forward with him into the future in whatever form that may take. 

""There's nothing lost by what Tristan is doing in this process. This is his right to do this. This system works for a reason."" 

The 6-foot-10 Thompson has until Thursday to accept the Cavs' one-year qualifying offer of $6.9 million to become an unrestricted free agent next year if no deal is reached. 

The Cavs have made different offers over the summer, going as high as $16 million in an average annual salary, according to ESPN. Thompson wants a three-year, $53 million max contract or a five-year deal for $94 million. 

The 24-year-old Thompson averaged 8.5 points and 8.0 rebounds during the 2014-15 regular season when he was the Cavs' sixth man. After Kevin Love was injured in the first round of the playoffs, Thompson started at power forward. In the NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors, he averaged 11.6 points and 12.6 rebounds. 

Cavs star LeBron James was asked about Thompson's situation at the team's media day. 

""As the leader of this team, I understand how important Tristan is to this team,"" James said Monday. ""I think we all saw what he's able to do in the postseason, and not only the postseason but all throughout. ... He's a huge piece to the puzzle, to our success. Not having him here today, possibly tomorrow or however long it is, that the organization and Tristan, they'll get something done. We all know how important he is to our success.""",f5201eb8-cd77-46a6-b13e-a7d0f8b8b8a1,News,2015-09-28T20:00:18Z,Channel4000,"Cavs, Thompson fail to reach deal",0.0,Blog
2901,"YUMA, Ariz- Nothing like dancing with your friends to good music on Labor Day weekend by the Colorado river. 
 
Many Yuma residents decided to stay in town this year to enjoy the holiday. 
 
One local said, “I’m with my boyfriend and his family so we’re just here at the river and we’re having fun. We’re just getting started so let’s see what the day brings us.” 
 
“I brought my sisters out here who came to visit from LA so I wanted to show them how actually nice and beautiful it gets out here and we just came with all of our kids having a great time here.” 
 
On Labor Day the Ocean to Ocean Bridge is a great destination for Yuma locals who enjoy tubing or having a barbecue with their friends and family. 
 
One visitor came out from LA and said, “It’s my first time and I’m out here visiting my sister so we just wanted to come see it.” 
 
While others were getting buried in the dirt. 
 
One Yuma resident said, “It feels really heavy. I let them do it we have fun building castles and playing with the dirt.”

Davis Follow @allisonpdavis No photos over six hours old allowed. 37 Shares Share 29 Tweet 8 Share 0 Pin It 0 Share Email Print Share Photo: Uwe Umstaetter/Westend61/Corbis The best photo of me was taken about a few years ago: I will never again look so young, so free, or so skinny as I was in that shot. Do I still use that fairly blatant misrepresentation of my current self on my OKCupid profile? You bet I do.  Unfortunately, a Swedish dating site called 7Heaven wants to ruin my internet game by only hosting photos of members that were taken in the last six hours. It can check timestamps. Don't even try to trick it; it's smarter than us.   Users can upload new ones as they want to, but only if they were recently snapped. It doesn’t matter who you are now — bald, chubby, with bad bangs, a bad haircut, or a new tattoo — 7Heaven only wants that authentic, current self presented to potential suitors. That seems like so much work! Trying to get yourself dating-site-selfie-ready every six hours?
At first I thought, Chill out! How much does a person actually change in six hours? But then I remembered the disparity between how I look at work and how I look when I come home at night, take off my pants, remove my makeup, and fall asleep on the couch for a few hours before I start Tindering. Maybe six hours is too long a time period.

1947,"Iloilo City – Iloilo City is anticipating a major economic boost from its hosting stint of the ongoing Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings in the country, which, in the long term, should help the local city government achieve its zero unemployment rate target in 2020. 
 
“The population of Iloilo City is close to 500,000 and our goal is to have at least three million visitors by year 2020. We all also know that for every six tourists that come to a certain locality, it provides one job. With three million visitors, that could take Iloilo a zero unemployment rate in 2020,” Iloilo City Mayor Jed Patrick Mabilog said in an interview with reporters. 
 
“But [our APEC hosting] is a good start for Iloilo’s vision for unemployment at the same time to increase purchasing power. It will boost the local economy, which is already happening right now because with Iloilo’s hosting of APEC, it accounts for additional 3,000 to 5,000 people [foreign delegates] now in Iloilo City participating in APEC,” he added. 
 
Mabilog emphasized that its hosting of this major regional forum will help develop Iloilo’s meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions (MICE) industry, which will create more jobs in the process. 
 
The 22nd APEC SME Ministerial Meeting and related activities, which were held at the recently opened government-owned Iloilo Convention Center (ICON), already concluded yesterday. 
 
Mabilog said ICON required the national government the biggest investment allocation for its preparation of APEC meetings, while the local government of Iloilo alone allotted as much as P5 million for securing locations, peace and order, and providing world-class entertainment for the delegates of member economies. 
 
“Of course, we expect an ROI [return of investment]. If the delegates had good experience, they can share this to their friends and relatives, they can bring them here. Because that would show that if a delegate would come to a certain area, certain locality, and would have a nice experience, the tendency is they would go back,” Mabilog said. 
 
“The big investments came from the national government, especially from the office of the president, which pushes for the development of ICON, which will boost the local economy because although the convention center is now fully booked until October 6, it has already reservations of about 30 conventions until the end of the year,” he further said. 
 
Other than the MICE industry, Iloilo is also expecting to grow its retail industry with the arrival and expansion of the country’s biggest conglomerates, such as the “Ayala Group, Gaisano, SM group, Megaworld, Filinvest,” among others. 
 
The city government of Iloilo also hosted the “Fostering APEC’s Infrastructure through Long-Term Investment and Capital Market Development” meeting last July.",ff627363-9507-4fc3-a004-8b1e000c2404,News,2015-09-25T10:31:57Z,Manila Bulletin,"Iloilo expects boost from APEC hosting, sees zero unemployment",0.0,News

Justin Lee reports: The Custom and Border Protection’s Entry/Exit Transformation (EXT) Office are piloting several programs to make the process of collecting biometric data from foreign traveler entering and leaving the United States less invasive, according to a report by Federal Times. The pilots will test new technologies such as fingerprinting and open-air pass-through scanners, including one project beginning November at the Otay Mesa border crossing in San Diego aimed at capturing biometric data on-the-move. The “Pedestrian Border Experiment” will test multiple on-the-move and stop-and-pause technologies, especially those involving face and iris scans, which are able to record biometrics as travellers walk by on their way to the gate.

3049,"Jason Strefeler, a music teacher at Mater Dei Catholic School, will sing in the Papal Choir during the pope's visit to Phildelphia. Geoff Patton — Montgomery Media 
 LANSDALE >> It just might be the biggest stage Mater Dei Catholic School music teacher Jason Strefeler, of Bensalem, sets foot on. 
Before millions of people, and accompanied by the Philadelphia Orchestra, he and 249 other singers will lift their voices in what is sure to be a performance they’ll never forget. 

Strefeler has been selected to be a member of the Papal Choir set to perform during Pope Francis’ visit to Philadelphia at the conclusion of the World Meeting of Families conference in Philadelphia Sept. 22 to 27. 

The choir will perform during the Papal Mass on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway Sept. 27 at 4 p.m. where conference officials have estimated 1.5 million people to be in attendance. 

“I have heard so many stories from people attending the Mass the last time a Pope was here in the 1970s and how you could hear a pen drop during his address — it was so quiet,” Strefeler said Thursday, referring to Pope John Paul II’s visit to Philadelphia in 1979. “To see such a big crowd assembled, in the name of Catholicism, will be a holy experience — a unique experience.” 

The 27-year-old music teacher, auditioned for the choir the last day try-outs were held at the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul in Philadelphia in the middle of the summer. He described the audition as challenging and one that really made him think about the notes he was singing with his baritone voice. 

After learning via email that he was selected to sing at the Papal Mass in mid-July, he said he was excited. Not only would he have a good chance to see the pope, but he was going to use a skill he said he is proud of — his voice — to honor him. 

“Pope Francis relates to the people,” he said. “He’s the way a Catholic should be, in my eyes. He’s out there, he’s meeting with people and he’s carrying on a lot of service to those around him.  He exemplifies and shows what it means to live the faith — he doesn’t expect anything in return.” 

The choir has met twice thus far and will be practicing every other Monday until the week of the performance, he said. The week of the WMOF, Strefeler said that they’ll have three practices before the Papal Mass. During the practices, the choir has worked on pieces by Beethoven, Mendelssohn and songs specially composed for the event, he said. 

A children’s choir, as well as high school, Spanish, Vietnamese and African-American choirs are also slated to take the stage, he said. Continued...

1139,"Traditionally a heart-over-head choice of manufacturer, Alfa Romeo is trying to up its fleet sales with the introduction of a Giulietta that will appeal to your wallet (and your fleet manager) as much as it appeals to your inner petrol-head. Cue the arrival of the Giulietta Business Edition.
The concept is simple: take the Italian manufacturer’s most fleet-orientated car, fit the new, more powerful, more economical 1.6-litre Euro 6 diesel engine and give it a host of technology designed to make the company car driver’s life a little easier
Alfa Romeo Giulietta1.6 JTDM-2 120 Business 5drProfile:9+35Mileage:8k Miles p/a£151.28Per Month, EXC VATBusiness Users OnlyView DetailsBusiness Leasing Deal by: V4B LtdSee our Alfa Romeo Giulietta leasing deals here: Business / PersonalBelies the kit list
An asking price of just over £19,000 makes the Business Edition about £600 more expensive than the entry-level car, but the price tag belies the kit list.
Satellite navigation, 17in alloy wheels, front and rear parking sensors, automatic lights and wipers, voice control and metallic paint all feature as standard.
You also get the 1.6-litre MultiJet diesel engine - a powerplant you're normally charged more than £1,000 for.
Recently upgraded to meet the Euro 6 emissions regulations, the four-cylinder unit has had its power output increased from 103bhp to 118bhp, while carbon dioxide emissions have dropped from 104g/km to a road tax-avoiding 99g/km.
As a result, the Business Edition drops a company car tax bracket to 17% and now returns 74.3mpg – up more than 5% on the 70.6mpg afforded by the old engine.
The power hike has made sure that the new engine is faster though, with the 0-62mph sprint now dealt with in ten seconds flat (down from the old car’s 11.3 seconds) and the top speed increased by 6mph to 121mph.
It doesn’t sound rapid, but a bucketful of torque ensures it feels faster than the figures suggest. There's a slight flat spot low down, but as the revs build the Giulietta surges ahead with urgency and though you'll have to work the six-speed manual transmission, making swift progress is perfectly feasible.Good cruiser
Considering this is an Alfa Romeo, however, it isn't especially sporty. Yes, selecting Dynamic on the DNA drive mode selector will sharpen the throttle response and add weight to the steering, but a Ford Focus will provide more smiles per mile.
The pedals are all wrong, with poor positioning and a very spongy middle pedal controlling grabby brakes, while the car also suffers from the classic Italian short leg/long arm driving position and totally numb steering. The gearbox isn't perfect either, but it's still one of the car's better features.
Reading all that might make you think the Giulietta is totally devoid of redeeming features and unworthy of any further consideration, but don't be quite so hasty.
Although the Giulietta is no hot hatch, it is quite a good motorway cruiser and, let's face it, company cars tend to spend more time cruising up and down the M1 than setting lap records at Mallory Park.
There's an awful lot of sound proofing under the bonnet and elsewhere in a (successful) bid to keep engine noise out of the cabin, while road and wind noise have been kept to a minimum too.
It's also comfortable, with supportive seats and just about enough space both in the boot and in the back to make it practical.Drop-dead gorgeous
The customary Alfa idiosyncrasies remain, however, with a seat adjustment that's almost totally inaccessible when the seat belt is fastened, there's absolutely nowhere to put your left foot and some of the plastics feel like they were made from recycled hard hats.
It may not drive like an Alfasud, but there's plenty there to remind you that it's from the same stable.
And you can forgive all the problems when you park up at the end of your journey, clamber out, lock the doors (cue irritating beeps) and have a look at what brought you all that way.
Very little in this class is even vaguely pretty, let alone this pretty. The Focus has something about it, but it's hardly drop-dead gorgeous, the Mazda3 is handsome in a slightly weird, angular kind of way and the VW Golf? Well that's quite classy but it just looks dull when parked alongside the curvy Giulietta.
From every angle it's stunning, with perfect proportions, doe eyes lined by striking LED daytime running lights and the Alfa grille cleaving its way down the front to provide a fitting centrepiece. Then, when you look at it from the rear, there are the exquisite tail lights and the squat stance. Even the key fob is a thing of beauty.The verdict
We'd never recommend that you make the Giulietta Business Edition your next company car - it has too many quirks and too many excellent rivals for that - but if you've had your heart set on an Alfa since you were old enough to know what an Alfa was, here's one you might actually be able to justify.

3690,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz headlined a Tea Party rally outside the U.S. Capitol in an effort to to pressure Congress to scuttle a controversial deal with Iran that would lift sanctions against the country in exchange for a pledge to hold off on developing nuclear weapons. 
 
The rally comes as Congress begins debate on a Republican-sponsored measure to disapprove of the deal negotiated by the Democratic administration of President Barack Obama. 
 
Trump, the current Republican presidential frontrunner, told several thousand Tea Partiers gathered on the Capitol's west lawn that he's never seen ""any transaction  so incompetently negotiated as our deal with Iran."" The billionaire businessman said the deal would enable Iran to halt its dealings with the United States and attempt to bring about Israel's end. 
 
""This Iranian nuclear deal is catastrophic,"" agreed Cruz, a U.S. Senator from Texas. ""It is the single greatest national security threat facing America."" 
 
He argued the influx of cash Iran would get under the agreement would make the Obama administration ""the world's leading financier of radical Islamic terrorism.:"" 
 
Under the proposed deal, Iran would agree not to develop a nuclear bomb for at least a decade in exchange for the removal of economic sanctions against Iran that are designed to prevent nuclear proliferation. Backers of the deal say it will keep Iran from going to war in the region, while critics believe it won't stop Iran from violating the treaty by secretly developing nuclear weapons. 
 
Enough Democrats in the U.S. Senate support the deal to prevent the matter from coming up for a vote in that legislative body. If Democrats agree to let the measure come up for a Senate vote and both Houses of Congress adopt it, it has enough support from Senate Democrats to sustain Obama's inevitable veto. 
 
Despite the measure's dim prospects, Republicans want to go forward with the vote to show their opposition to the deal and hold Democrats responsible if the pact destabilizes the Middle East. 
 
Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown backs the agreement, calling it ""the only viable option"" to achieve the goal of preventing Iran from developing or acquiring a nuclear weapon."" 
 
""This deal is not about trusting the Iranian regime, but instead working with our allies on comprehensive, verifiable restrictions to block Iran's pathways to a nuclear bomb without precipitating another war in the Middle East,"" said a statement Brown released in August. 
 
Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, said he opposes the deal because it abandons longstanding U.S. and international non-proliferation goals, fails to block a long term path for Iran to pursue a nuclear weapons program, contains inadequate enforcement and verification measures to ensure compliance and provides Iran with greater resources to pursue its violent and destabilizing regional agenda. 
 
The House of Representatives has begun debate on the resolution to disapprove the deal and scheduled a Friday vote on it to coincide with the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 
 
Republican House members Bob Gibbs of Holmes County, Jim Jordan of Champaign County, Dave Joyce of Russell Township and Jim Renacci of Wadsworth have announced they oppose the treaty. Renacci said the main deal won't dismantle Iran's nuclear program, but would instead dismantle sanctions that brought Iran to the negotiating table in the first place. 
 
""It would also allow for billions of dollars in sanctions relief to a regime that is a state sponsor of terrorism, and has pledged to wipe Israel off the map,"" Renacci said 
 
Gibbs complained it ""effectively gives Iran 24 days to protest and delay any inspections."" 
 
""This is unacceptable,"" Gibbs continued. ""Iran must agree to and comply with unannounced, unimpeded inspections at any location and any time."" 
 
Niles Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan on Wednesday announced that he'll back the deal. He said the international community understands the importance of bringing Iran to the table to help create a deal that will not only limit Iran's nuclear program but provide the transparency and verification necessary. 
 
""I am convinced that this deal is the best way forward to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, ensuring the safety of Israel, and clearing the way for future interactions between the United States and Iran,"" said Ryan. ""Let's put America in the smartest and best position to deal with a regime we don't trust and to bravely lead an uncertain and fearful world."" 
 
The rest of Northeast Ohio's Democratic Congress members haven't announced whether they support the measure. 
 
Audience members at the rally compared the deal with agreements other nations made with Nazi Germany before that country launched World War II. 
 
""A majority of people in America don't want this,"" said Bill Campenni, a retired Air Force fighter pilot who lives in Herndon, Virginia. ""It's a strategic disaster."" 
 
Dayton native Debbie Witow said she feared Iran would secure nuclear weapons and use them against the United States. 
 
""Better no deal than this deal,"" she said.",f9e532cf-891c-4e8d-bd19-52b047d9f81f,News,2015-09-09T21:41:06Z,Cleveland.com,Donald Trump and Ted Cruz lead U.S. Capitol rally against Iran nuclear deal (video and photos),0.0,News

(businesspress24) - VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA -- (Marketwired) -- 09/28/15 --   Western Potash Corp. (TSX: WPX)(FRANKFURT: AHE) (the ""Western"", ""the Company"") is pleased to announce that subsequent to the closing of the strategic investment from Beijing Tairui Innovation Capital Management Ltd. (""Tairui""), announced September 16th of this year, Mr. Chang Xiaogang (Geoffrey) has been elected to the position of Executive Chairman of the Board of Western Potash Corp. 

Mr. Chang is a graduate of Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management with a Master''s Degree in Business Administration. Previously he served as President and Chairman of Shanxi Top Energy Company Ltd., Deputy Chairman of Shanxi Securities Ltd., Deputy Chairman of Shanxi Zhangze Power Company Ltd., Chairman and President of Shanxi International Power Group Ltd. Mr. Chang also served as a full-time independent director of SASAC, China''s State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. 

Patricio Varas, CEO commented,"" The Western Potash board is pleased to welcome Geoffrey Chang as newly elected Chairman. Mr. Chang and Tairui bring a wealth of relevant experience that will help guide Western as the Company begins the transition to project construction."" 

Environmental Assessment Approval: 

Western is also pleased to announce that it has received Environmental Assessment Approval from the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment (""SMoE"") for the Milestone Project Pilot Plant, (""the Pilot Plant""). Western submitted an Environmental Impact Statement (""EIS"") for the Milestone Project initially in early 2013 as the project was considered a ""Development"" as defined in the province of Saskatchewan''s Environmental Assessment Act (""EAA""). As such it was subject to an Environmental Impact Assessment. Following a regulatory review, the EIS received Ministerial Approval from SMoE in April 2013. 

Subsequently, Western re-scoped the project as detailed in the Scoping Study for a Scalable Pilot Plant delivered earlier this year and announced in the July 2nd, 2015 news release. The Milestone Project Pilot Plant by contrast provides an alternative methodology that employs lower capital using innovative selective potash solution mining techniques. The change in mining methodology and design proposed for the Pilot Plant required review under the EAA as it represented a change from the original 2013 approval. A Project Description outlining the Pilot Plant was submitted to SMoE in July, 2015. Following review of the Project Description, Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment concluded that the proposed change will not result in significant environmental impacts different from those identified in the original EIS and is satisfied that the requirements of the EAA have been met.

New My Cloud OS 3 Puts Control of Content into the Hands of Consumers with Greater Photo Sharing, Backup and Synchronization

BERLIN 

WD's My Cloud OS 3 features an intuitive user interface delivering a rich content-sharing experience, and back-up and sync capabilities that elevate the personal cloud NAS offering while retaining the privacy and control unique to personal cloud devices physically located in the home or office.

""We know our personal cloud customers place the highest value on their personal content and enjoy the peace of mind from backing up PCs, smart phones and tablets to and centralizing content on their My Cloud systems,"" said Jim Welsh, executive vice president and general manager of Content Solutions business at WD. ""They tell us they are confident in the privacy, control and anywhere access we provide them with the My Cloud OS. Now, with My Cloud OS 3, we've made users' management of their digital lives easier than ever before.""

My Cloud OS 3 features powerful new photo and video capabilities via two new user experiences: MyCloud.com and My Cloud Albums app. MyCloud.com provides users global access to their My Cloud via an intuitive web browser-based user interface and enables file collaboration, comprehensive access management and a photos and videos gallery view. My Cloud Albums, available for download late September on iTunes and Google Play stores, allows a My Cloud OS 3 user to send a link to a common location, or ""album"", on the My Cloud to all their friends and family.

My Cloud OS 3's new WD Sync™ feature syncs data across multiple PCs and notebooks, ensuring that important files are up to date and available to users from almost any device. The new OS also allows users to set up automatic camera-roll backup of photos from smartphones and tablets and offers a new transfer tool that enables users to easily and quickly move their files to My Cloud devices. The OS also includes Chromebook and Chromecast support.

As part of the My Cloud OS 3 launch, WD has introduced My Cloud Device SDK and My Cloud API enabling developers to build new extensions, features and capabilities within the My Cloud ecosystem of personal cloud storage devices. The My Cloud Device SDK, based on the Docker™ open platform technology, ensures developers can easily access and collaborate to create customized experiences. Partners already developing extensions and new features based on the new SDK include Plex and Milestone.

In addition to new software upgrades, WD has also introduced a new version of My Cloud Mirror personal cloud storage devices, featuring two hard drives set to Mirror Mode (RAID 1), ensuring content is stored on one drive and automatically duplicated to a second drive. My Cloud Mirror personal cloud storage includes the new features announced for My Cloud OS 3 and an improved processor and 512 MB RAM for faster file transfers and application support.

Attendees of the annual IFA Consumer Electronics Unlimited show in Berlin 

Pricing and Availability

WD My Cloud OS 3 will be available at the end of the month as a free download on current My Cloud personal cloud storage devices. My Cloud devices supporting the new OS 3 include: My Cloud, My Cloud Mirror, My Cloud Expert Series EX2/EX4, My Cloud Expert Series EX2100/EX4100 and My Cloud Business Series DL2100/DL4100. Customers can also download the new WD My Cloud mobile apps, which are now available on the iTunes and Google Play stores. All WD My Cloud devices are available today in the WD store at wdstore.com and at select retailers and distributors. Access to My Cloud Device SDK and My Cloud API will be available to interested developers late September.

1168,"Reuters  –  
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgium's hopes of reaching their first Davis Cup final in over a century remained alive when world number 15 David Goffin comfortably beat Argentina's Diego Schwartzman in the fourth rubber to take their semi-final into a decisive final singles. 
 
Goffin won 6-3 6-2 6-1 in just over an hour and a half. 
 
The final rubber will see Belgium's Steve Darcis face off Argentina's Federico Delbonis with the winning nation facing Britain in the final after Andy Murray secured an unbeatable 3-1 lead over Australia earlier on Sunday.

4057,"One thing I love about Omri is he smiles every time see him. Sometimes if I just step into another room and then come back, he'll give me a smile and want to be held by me for a bit. The smiles are especially big first thing in the morning or when I return home from work. I'm so grateful to have had a sweet little guy like him in my life for the last year. And just think about how much fun the next year holds.
He was so curious (and still is) about the Happy Birthday sign we hung in our foyer:
He's been wanting to get outside quite often. He'll walk to the patio door and try to slide it open. If he can't, he'll want us to pick him up so he can get at the lock.
Momma took the day off on Friday to spend time with him.
It hasn't been long since Omri's baptism reception, so we decided to avoid the stress and have a low-key birthday celebration this year. Momma made him his own (healthy) cake:
Unfortunately I didn't manage to capture a great shot with him with the cake for my series (the boy wanted to grab the burning candle and broke down crying when we didn't give it to him).
I have plenty of him squashing the cake though!
I don't think any of it ended up in his mouth.",4c51ccf5-9b3b-4ac7-a53c-9f71ecf80ff1,Blog,2015-09-12T15:56:36Z,Four Peas in a Blog,Omri's birthday,1.0,Blog
5952,"No. 13 Oregon vs. No. 18 Utah When: 5:45 p.m., Saturday, FOX. Records: Oregon (2-1, 0-0 Pac-12); Utah (3-0, 0-0) Utes this season: The root of Utah's challenge is finding a phase where it is not solid. Defensively, it ranks in the top quarter of college football in points allowed (18.3) and is well-prepared for Pac-12 play after facing three different styles of offense in nonconference play. It starts by allowing opponents just 105.7 yards per game on the ground. Senior linebacker Jared Norris's 28 tackles lead the team and along with Hunter Dimick, the Utes have -- so far -- weathered the loss of all-conference defensive end Nate Orchard to the NFL. The Utes have forced eight turnovers, tied with UO's output so far, and has returned a fumble for a touchdown (also like Oregon). On offense the quarterback play doesn't inspire confidence with the musical chairs between Kendal Thompson and Travis Wilson, who sat out last week with a sprained left shoulder. As a result, the offense can often look one-sided. But running back Devontae Booker is a true star, who had 212 all-purpose yards in a 45-24 win Saturday at Fresno State. ""Their special teams are another animal entirely,"" UO coach Mark Helfrich said, and it's easy to spot the concern. The Utes scored touchdowns against Fresno State on a kick return (by Cory Butler-Byrd) and punt return (by Britain Covey) and feature the best punter of 2014, Tom Hackett, and a solid kicker in Andy Phillips. Star power: Running back Devontae Booker. After gaining 1,818 yards of total offense in 2014 and becoming a darkhorse Heisman Trophy candidate, Booker is averaging 115 yards per game on the ground this fall in wins against Michigan, Utah State and Fresno State. The Utes have needed every inch given their (again) inconsistent quarterback play. Booker gets more carries on first down than any other and 30 of his 84 rushes this season have resulted in a first down. He's also a threat catching the ball out of the backfield; his average of 157 all-purpose yards per game ranks 20th in the country. Did you know: Utah defenders won Pac-12 player of the week honors after each of the season's first two games. Justin Thomas, a nickel back, earned the honor after a win against Michigan, and he was followed by linebacker Gionni Paul taking the award after a win against Utah State, a victory in which he recorded seven tackles, one for loss, recovered a fumble and had an interception. Threat level (1-5 scale): 4. Utah's reputation as one of the country's toughest teams precedes it, and will shape the storyline around this game two weeks after Oregon's offensive line was pushed around by Michigan State, another squad that rolled out relentless pressure. Early prediction: Oregon 38, Utah 24 -- Andrew Greif

He is understood to be speaking to officers from Police Scotland in West Lothian today.

The businessman took control at the Ibrox club in 2012 after completing a purchase of Rangers' assets and business after it went into administration and liquidation earlier that year. 

Mr Green stepped down as CEO of the club the following year after it was alleged he had links with former owner Craig Whyte - a claim he denied.

1454,"Little Mix have unveiled their latest song, Love Me Like You, and their fans ADORE it. 
 
The girl band visited Capital Radio to debut their new tune and chat to Dave Berry and Lisa Snowdon on their breakfast show. 
 Little Mix with Lisa and Dave (Ian West/PA)  
Little Mix said: “We’re excited – it’s very different to Black Magic, which is why we’re excited for everyone to hear it.” 
 
Dave and Lisa also got One Direction to give their thoughts on the new track backstage at their gig at the O2 on Thursday. 
 
“It’s a nice laid-back kind of song,” said Liam Payne, while Harry Styles praised the new direction for the band. “I’m liking the newer kind of sound, loving it,” he said. 
 
The girls supported One Direction in their Apple Music Festival gig at Camden’s Roundhouse on Tuesday night. 
 
Afterwards, Perrie Edwards posted a picture of her cosying up to her backing dancer, Rycardo Gomez, which seemed to rattle one (former) member of the group. 
 
Her former fiance, Zayn Malik, posted a cryptic tweet which many believe was meant for the blonde beauty.

But Perrie and the band looked like they couldn’t care less as they partied with Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson post-gig.

5376,"A recent LNP article explains manure digesters, the ways in which they benefit the environment and farmers, and a proposed bill that would ensure farmers can sell the excess electricity they generate .    The recently proposed state regulations could affect farmers across the state.  In today’s environment, one of the factors that limit a farm operation is how to handle manure from the operation.  Some farmers have installed “digesters” which take methane gas produced by the manure and turn that methane gas into electricity that is used to operate the farm.  The manure that comes out of the digesters is safer for the environment, and is easier to manage by the farmers.  The use of manure digesters is good for farmers and is good for the environment as well. In addition, if the digesters produce more electricity than the farm needs, the farmer sells that electricity to the electric company.  This helps pay for the cost and maintenance of the digester. 
 
The proposed state regulations deal with what happens when the farmer makes more electricity than is needed on the farm.  Electric companies are not very eager to buy this electricity – which is a smaller amount, can be intermittent or unpredictable, and is more expensive than buying it from a big wind or solar farm.  It also doesn’t always “enter the grid” in the spot that electric companies would prefer.  Because of these issues, electric companies would like to limit the amount of electricity that farmers can sell back.  The proposed regulations would protect a farmer’s ability to sell some of their extra electricity produced from these digesters.

3810,"Sept. 11 --A house fire at 149 Park Street in Grove City has been ruled an arson by state police. 
 
Trooper Luke Nelson , a fire marshal from the Lawrence County barracks, said that he made the determination on Aug. 28 -- 15 days after the fire had occurred. 
 
The house was a rental owned by Bevan Properties in Grove City , and occupied by a mother and her children. The house was insured by both the renter and landlord, Nelson said. 
 
""Both the insurance companies and I were all in agreement to the cause of this fire,"" Nelson said yesterday. Grove City police are investigating the fire; however, the department called in Nelson to determine if it was a crime. 
 
""Before they jumped all in it, they had to know it was a crime,"" he said. 
 
The fire's ""point of origin was a recliner chair in the middle of the living room,"" Nelson said. ""It appeared to (begin) on top of the chair on the seat cushion and back cushion."" 
 
What could not be determined is that the fire was set ""by visible or identifiable ignition sources,"" Nelson said. ""There were no electrical devices capable of producing heat around that chair."" 
 
However, he wanted to make sure the room was thoroughly sifted to find a possible non-criminal reason for the fire, since heavy water pressure produced from fire hoses may have misplaced it, he added. 
 
""I had to make sure it was not fire suppression. I was able to rule out pretty much any type of accidental source,"" Nelson said. 
 
""It was likely deliberately set on fire with an open flame, which is what I expected immediately."" 
 
Now Grove City police will continue its investigation with the help of the fire marshal to determine who set the fire, he added. 
 
""Arson investigations are difficult, especially if a circumstantial case,"" said Nelson, who would not give any details about suspects. 
 
""Circumstantially it may seem obvious (who set the fire) but there needs to be a stronger case at this time as far as the responsible party,"" he said. 
 
""Very rarely do we have an eyewitness sitting and watching a person do it. You have to make sure it's investigated as thoroughly as possible.""

5646,"iMindQ 7 for Windows contains new and enhanced features that make it a capable tool for gathering, organizing, distilling and sharing information with others – including a new research panel, the ability to save mind maps to an interactive HTML format and support for enhanced note taking. 
 
In this review, we’ll take a closer look at the latest version of Seavus’ mind mapping program, focusing on its business-oriented features and functionality. 
 Research panel  
One of iMindQ’s best new features is its integrated research panel, which enables you to conduct online searches and add relevant information to your mind map. It opens in a vertical panel on the right side of the workspace and enables you to conduct keyword searches of Google Search, Google Images, OpenClipart, and Twitter. Adding information to your map is a simple drag-and-drop operation. 
 
I conducted several searches using the Research Panel, and was satisfied with its responsiveness. Links and images opened quickly, and it was easy to drag and drop information to my mind map. I especially liked the Twitter mentions, which appear in their entirety in my mind map – along with a large, blue Twitter icon. This makes it easy to see the source of this information at a glance. 
 
The one problem I ran into was attempting to drag and drop a larger image from Google image search into my mind map. As I approached the topic where I wanted to drop it, the floating image completely covered it, making it impossible to see if my destination topic was highlighted. As a result, two attempts at adding this image to my map resulted in it getting attached to the wrong topic the first time, and as a floating image the second time. 
 Interactive HTML mind maps  
Interactive mind maps in iMindQ 7 are saved in an HTML format that you can upload on any website, blog or document management system, share on social media networks or send it via e-mail. They can be opened with any browser and can be zoomed, navigated and presented as animated stories or edited within the browser itself. 
 
I exported a simple mind map with 8 first-level topics and 2 second-level topics, and then opened it in a web browser. It opens with a small, vertical toolbar with 6 controls in the upper left corner of the page that allow you to zoom in, zoom out, center the map, zoom it to fill the screen and play an animation of it. The last option draws each branch, one at a time; there doesn’t appear to be a way to control the animation on a branch-by-branch basis. If you could do so, it would be more useful as a presentation tool. The top button takes you to the iMindQ web page. I think Seavus hopes that people who view your exported mind maps will be intrigued and will want to learn more about the program. 
 
If you click on an information icon in the upper right corner of the screen, a pop-over window appears that explains what you can do with this mind map. I tried dragging and dropping topics as it instructed; this worked smoothly. Hypertext links open in a new tab. You can also add and remove topics to an interactive mind map, although it’s not immediately obvious how to do so. By trial and error, I figured out that you can use the Insert key to do so (the de facto standard for adding topics to mind maps). It would be nice if this was called out in the instructions. 
 
I’m not sold on the idea of giving people the ability to modify your mind maps, but the developer says any changes visitors make are not saved to the existing map. Topics can be removed by visitors so they can remove any extraneous topics that aren’t relevant to them, giving them a clearer picture of the remaining topics. 
 Enhanced note taking  
iMindQ 7’s topic notes panel has been enhanced in this new version to enable you to do more complex formatting. You can now insert: 
  Images  Tables  Links to external web pages, mind map topics, files, folders and e-mails   
The toolbar looks much like Microsoft Word, with buttons logically grouped. One nice feature is a pair of buttons that enable you to move to the previous or next searches you’ve conducted. If you do a lot of online research and find yourself going back to previous sources to double-check your information, you’ll appreciate this feature. 
 
Another plus: A “remove formatting” button that reverts any text you import to the program’s default text style (Arial 8 pt.). Why is this important? Often, when you capture information from web pages, your notes inherit whatever formatting the web page designer used. This feature enables you to easily strip that out, giving your notes a neater, more uniform look. 
 
Hypertext links were a pleasant surprise. Usually, mind mapping programs contain only one option for topic note links: To a web page address. Clicking on the links icon in notes view opens a dialog box that gives you 4 options: 
  Map topic (opens an outline view of your mind map so you can select the topic to which you want to link)  Web page  File or folder  Email (this doesn’t link to specific e-mail messages; it simply lets you add a mailto: link to your notes, which opens a new mail form pre-addressed to the e-mail address you put in the link)   
This gives you a lot of flexibility to tie together your notes with other sources – nice! 
 
I do have several minor complaints with notes view, however: First, you can’t drag an image to resize it. I randomly selected an image from my laptop’s hard drive, without paying attention to its size, and added it to the notes view. It appeared quite large, so I tried to figure out how to resize it. With the developer’s help, I learned that this can be accomplished via a right-click “size” command, which asks you to input new dimensions in pixels. 
 
Next, I added a table to my notes. This worked fine, except that I expected it to behave like tables do in Microsoft Word – but it didn’t. For example, I’m used to adding text to a table cell and then using the Tab key to move to the next cell. Apparently, iMindQ 7 doesn’t support this. Also, it doesn’t appear to be possible to adjust column widths. Once again, it’s nice that the program supports this functionality, but it could be improved. 
 Import and export OPML format  
OPML is sort of like the Rosetta Stone of mind mapping software: It enables you to share maps with other programs. iMindQ 7 now has the ability to import and export mind maps in this file format. I exported my simple mind map to OPML and then opened it in a competing mind mapping program. All of the topics and links appeared properly, but topic notes were stripped out. This isn’t iMindQ’s fault; rather, it’s a limitation of the OPML format. It’s nice to see Seavus supporting such interactivity. 
 New map parts save time  
iMindQ 7 now includes 53 map parts that are designed around the needs of typical business people. They are divided into groups: 
  Analysis  Brainstorming  General business  Meeting  Project  Quality assurance   
I’m a big fan of map parts, because they speed the production of mind maps. Why reinvent the wheel when you can simply drag and drop a map part into your existing mind map? 
 
iMindQ’s map parts appear in a vertical panel on the right side of the workspace. They are displayed as a set of thumbnail images and names. A drop-down list lets you filter the long list of map parts by group, making it easier to navigate. To add a map part to your mind map, you have two options: drag and drop it, or utilize a right-click command. 
 
You can also convert branches of your mind maps into map parts. Simply select the topic you want to designate as the parent topic of your new map part, and click on the “add selected topic(s)” link at the bottom of the map parts panel. I really like this capability, because it enables you to customize iMindQ 7 to your needs. If you frequently create the same types of maps, you’ll love this time-saving feature. 
 Presentation mode adds advanced animations  
iMindQ 7 now enables you to automatically create a presentation from your mind map with a single click. It creates a series of “scenes” that appear in a vertical panel on the left side of the program’s workspace. You can also add your own scenes manually. But the new version of iMindQ takes presentation mode one step farther by providing a set of sophisticated animation tools that are very similar to the ones in Microsoft PowerPoint. They give you options such as focus, fade in, fade out, blur and rotate; you can easily preview these effects using a button at the bottom of the preview panel. In addition, it contains controls that let you control when the effect occurs (on click, with previous, with next) and several timing controls. 
 
This is the first time I’ve seen such animation tools applied to a mind mapping program, and I must say, I like it a lot. It’s a great way to add extra “sizzle” to your presentations, and it’s designed to encourage experimentation. 
 
When you play a presentation, you advance through the scenes you’ve created using the space bar. I’m pleased to see that iMindQ 7 zooms and pans you around your mind map, one topic at a time, instead of breaking it into “slides” that look disjointed and don’t give you a sense of where the topic you’re viewing resides within the overall mind map. 
 Conclusion  
Seavus continues to evolve iMindQ quickly, adding many new features while maintaining decent ease of use. I especially like the new research panel, which makes it easy to do online research without having to switch between this mind mapping program and a web browser. Map parts are also a valuable addition. Many of us tend to perform the same tasks in our work on a regular basis. The ability to create and store branch templates is a real time-saver for these repetitive tasks. 
 
Overall, with the exception of a few minor usability issues, iMindQ 7 is a very capable program that is well-suited to many business applications. iMindQ 7 continues to be an excellent value at $142 (€109.0) for a single license with a one-year software maintenance agreement. To experience this new version of iMindQ firsthand, you can download a 15-day trial version of it here .

Wimbledon will continue to be shown on the BBC after the broadcaster announced a three-year extension to its contract with the All England Club. 

The BBC has secured the rights to the Championships until 2020, keeping the annual event on free-to-air platforms amid speculation that a subscription broadcaster such as Sky or BT Sport would make a bid. 

This year's men's title was won by Novak Djokovic while Serena Williams was victorious in the women's event.

The BBC first broadcast from Wimbledon in 1937 and the extension of the deal, the longest of its sort in the world, has been met with praise by the chief executive of the All England Club, Richard Lewis. 

'Our long partnership with the BBC has brought the excitement and drama of the Championships to viewers and listeners for over 80 years,' he said. 
 
'We are delighted to be extending our successful association for a further three years until 2020. The BBC consistently delivers large national audiences for Wimbledon and they deliver those audiences with high-quality production values, live across multiple platforms and always with a strong narrative.

3277,"London - Rory McIlroy will be able to play in the European Tour's Final Series tournaments after being given special exemption due to his ankle injury. 

The injury, sustained in a football kickabout with friends in July, meant that the world number one was unable to meet the 13-event qualification standard in order to remain in the Race to Dubai even though he currently leads the rankings. 

The Northern Irishman had to sit out the Scottish Open, the Open at St Andrews and the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, which would have all worked towards his qualifying tally. 

However, after discussions with the European Tour, McIlroy has committed to play a further three events to take his tally to 12 and, as a result, officials have used their discretion to ensure their star name is not absent from their showpiece finale. 

""These are exceptional circumstances and I have taken this situation and the resulting decision very seriously,"" said new chief executive Keith Pelley. 

""I have spent the last two weeks examining every angle and every possible solution and I have spoken with Rory and his team, as well as independent medical advisers and some prominent players. 

""Therefore, after lengthy discussions, I have given him approval to play a minimum of 12 European Tour events this year."" 

The Final Series begins with the Turkish Airlines Open at the end of October, takes in the WGC-Champions event and BMW Masters in China, before climaxing at the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai in November. 

European Tour officials made the obvious decision to offer dispensation to McIlroy in order to protect both their short and long-term investments.",f59d2356-24d9-437f-8bf9-9749e67d175e,News,2015-09-02T15:01:37Z,Sport24.co.za,McIlroy given special exemption,0.0,News

2917,"Thousands of migrants who had been stuck for days in Southeastern Europe have started arriving in Austria after Hungary escorted them to the border.

Austrian police on September 19 reported 6,700 new arrivals from Hungary since midnight, amid deepening discord in Europe over the biggest westward migration in decades.

The development comes after thousands of migrants, many lacking food and water, were trapped in Southeastern Europe, in some cases for several days, after countries began putting up barriers that blocked their passage to Western Europe.

The migrant path was first blocked by Hungary, which sealed off its southern border with Serbia with a razor-wire fence and tough other measures to keep people out.

That caused a massive influx of more than 15,000 people over three days into Croatia, which could not cope and then began escorting people to the border with Hungary.

In response, Hungary transported the migrants to the border with Austria by bus and train. 

WATCH: There were harrowing scenes on September 18 at Croatia's border with Serbia, as riot police tried to hold back thousands of refugees and migrants trying to find a new route to Western Europe. The Croatian government says at least 9,200 migrants have entered the country since Hungary closed its borders this week. Meanwhile, Slovenia has blocked off its borders and used pepper spray on migrants late on September 18.

Published July 30, 2015 | By GRACE Video	Download PDF of this page
  What is the role for the neuroprotective agent memantine in patients receiving whole brain radiation therapy for brain metastases? Dr. Vivek Mehta reviews current practices to minimize risk of cognitive problems. Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 2:05 — 19.5MB) Download Transcript How Did You Like This Video?
Please feel free to offer comments and raise questions in our Discussion Forums.   Transcript I see number of patients that are going to need whole brain radiation for multiple brain metastasis in the brain, and one of the questions that has come up recently is, “is there anything out there we can do to reduce the cognitive impairment that’s associated with whole brain radiation?” Well, just a short while ago, we learned some really interesting, but preliminary, results on using a medicine called memantine. It’s actually a medicine that’s often used in Alzheimer’s disease, but it was done in a study where patients who were receiving whole brain radiation either got this medication, or didn’t get this medication. The results of the study suggest that there may be a benefit in terms of preventing the onset of cognitive impairment if you get this medicine.  Now, this is one of the very first studies, and it’s a relatively small study — it probably needs to be duplicated with a larger number of patients, it probably needs to be done in more stringent fashion, to really see and tease out whether this really works. I’ll tell you that, from a radiation oncology community, there’s a fair bit of excitement about this, because we want to do anything we can to potentially reduce this particular complication, because, in the patients that get this disease and survive for a long period of time, we want to keep their mental status as high as possible. In my clinic, when I see patients that bring this up, we often try to get this medication. One of the challenges that we have encountered is that insurance companies are not authorizing this for payment in this particular indication, and a medication, if you are buying it on your own, is awfully expensive.  So, we have not had as much success as we’d like, or the clinical experience in seeing patients truly benefit from this. It would be nice to see more studies, more data, and then convince the payers that this actually works, and that this should be moving into the standard of care. But I don’t think, today, that it’s something that we routinely offer to our patients because of these impediments.

2497,"Sunday, 27th September: Another lovely day, though with the north-easterly breeze picking up during the morning..... Ferry Pool: There were three Spotted Redshanks, three Green Sandpipers, a Common Sandpiper, a Snipe and 24 Dunlin on the pool at high tide, along with half a dozen Lapwing, c30 Black-tailed Godwits and c80 Lapwing.

3219,"In anticipation of Assassin's Creed Syndicate's October release, Ubisoft shares a new story trailer for the game, featuring the list of Jacob and Evie Frye's…  
By Kyle Sledge | 1 min ago 

The Assassin’s Creed series continues to be a boon for Ubisoft, for not only does a new entry in the franchise get released each year, but the game also has become an inspiration for creators in other mediums as well, as the series now has a movie release in the works. Even so, after last year’s launch for Assassin’s Creed Unity was infamously riddled with bugs and glitches, fans are hoping for more concerted efforts by the studio to ensure Assassin’s Creed Syndicate is up to snuff before it goes live. 

Ubisoft has addressed the issues surrounding previous entries in the series, saying that they learned from Unity. Bearing that in mind, it’s important for the developers to provide a rock solid release with the forthcoming sequel should they wish to retain the franchise’s fan base, while also expanding their audience at the same time. To put it succinctly, Assassin’s Creed Syndicate‘s technical aspects and narrative threads need to be airtight if the franchise is to survive and thrive. 

Speaking of plot, Ubisoft has given fans a taste of Syndicate‘s tale with previous footage, such as the game’s cinematic trailer revealed at E3 2015 a few months back, which mostly focused on the general tone of the environment, revealing a gloomy 1868 industrial London setting. Now, the studio is offering up a brand new video that emphasizes the league of enemies of which the title’s dual protagonists and two playable characters – Jacob and Evie Frye – must bring down on behalf of the working class in order to save the city from falling into rampant corruption. 

As seen in the above clip, the twin assassins certainly have their work cut out for them, as the head of London’s Templar order, Crawford Starrick, has seven separate henchmen in his employ, all of whom have their hands in the city’s most prominent honeypots and industries holding up society. Making up the cast of villains, there’s the ruthless industrialist Rupert Ferris, the money-grubbing transportation tycoon Pearl Attaway, the mad doctor duo of John Elliotso…",70a5983f-80bf-479f-80ce-cc614088b2c9,News,2015-09-24T18:35:36Z,MyInforms,Assassin’s Creed Syndicate Releases New Story Trailer,0.0,Blog
1958,"There has been a dramatic drop in Subiaco office rental values — with a massive jump in vacancies — but Colliers International is confident about the area’s mid-term future. 

New research by Colliers International presents a dismal set of statistics for investors in Subiaco office market, with a 15.1 per cent office vacancy and 24,425sqm of empty stock in July. 

Prime office rents ranged from $295sqm to $395sqm, down 17.5 per cent in the past year and by 30 per cent since its peak in 2012. 

If that were not bad enough, Colliers director office leasing Neil Kidd believes vacancy rates will take another hit when the stadium closes, with the closure to undermine the perception of Subiaco as a vibrant hub of activity. 

However, he said investors were voting with their feet, confident that Subiaco’s fortunes would rebound. 

A further 12,525sqm of office space is under construction, due for completion by the end of next year, in developments such as the old Ace Cinema development and an office at 23 Railway St. 

“The new space  ... shows a level of confidence in Subiaco being able to sustain not only more residents and more retail, but increased office and commercial space,” he said. 

Mr Kidd said the quality of the Subiaco stock was better than neighbouring West Perth, with a much lower 11 per cent vacancy rate. 

However he said  better public transport options and better quality stock would soon make Subiaco the more attractive market. 

“There are some critical factors that have to be in place to sell suburban space,” he explained.“It has to be a recognised location. 

“Next is security, including after-hours activation of the area. 

“If you can’t walk out at night after work and feel safe, it is hard for businesses to get employees on board. 

“This is where the retail and restaurant trade makes a difference in Subiaco versus other areas — more so than in West Perth.” 

The latest Metro Office report shows Subiaco has approximately 162,000sqm of commercial space in buildings with more than 1000sqm of office space with two-thirds of this space less than 10 years old.",616d0a5b-7e14-46b7-a911-5df090ef91ff,News,2015-09-15T23:23:00Z,West Australian,Subi office values slide (The West Australian),0.0,News
721,"At his heaviest, Dawn Lerman’s dad was 450 lbs. He tried to lose weight all the time—every week, he engaged in a new diet, some more successful than others, but nothing stuck. 
 
“In every corner of our house, there was no wall space,” Lerman says. “[Each wall] was either lined from floor to ceiling with diet books or shirts that represented my dad’s different weights. There was a pile: 185, 195, 205, 215, 225.” 
 
Lerman, a nutrition expert, cooking teacher, and Upper West Side mom-of-two, reflects on her tumultuous childhood relationship with food and how it affected her relationship with her family in her recent memoir, aptly named My Fat Dad . In the book, she describes how her creative family—her mother and sister were actresses, and her father worked in advertising as a writer and creative director, responsible for iconic slogans such as “Leggo My Eggo” and “Fly the Friendly Skies”—was always obsessing over food, but never in a healthy way. Her dad would diet, then maybe eat an entire pizza, then switch diets, while her mom would prepare either processed foods or nothing at all. It was Lerman’s grandmother who showed Lerman that, when prepared correctly, food could be a source of joy rather than stress. 
 
Lerman’s grandmother, whom people called Beauty, cooked traditional Jewish meals and encouraged making food into art rather than temporary sustenance. She and Lerman would sit down for meals, and no matter what they’d cooked, it would be set out on a nice plate, perhaps served with tea, and the two would eat “like ladies.” 
 
“My grandmother really drilled it into my head that food is love, food is happiness, [and] everything has to have a smell,”   Lerman says. “If it smells, if it has an aroma—it’s going to transform your world.” 
 
Once Lerman’s family moved from Chicago when she was 9, and she left Beauty behind, it was harder to stay positive. But Beauty would send recipe cards to Lerman at her new home in New York City. 
 
“My grandmother’s recipe cards saved my life because it kept me from getting in trouble. Every week I had this purpose and this mission,” Lerman says. “I had to go home, I had my recipe cards, I had to cook them for my sister…and I knew I had to take care of myself because nobody else would.” 
 
Lerman combined teachings from all the cooks in her life, whether it be Beauty’s “throw it in” style or her baker Aunt Jeannie’s carefully-measured approach, to take care of her own family. Her memories of Jeannie’s healthy “swaps” (like switching butter with applesauce) helped inspire Lerman to start her nutrition awareness program, Magnificent Mommies , which offers workshops to create healthier lifestyles for young children and their adults. 
 
But despite food’s looming presence in her formative years, Lerman’s path to becoming a nutritionist wasn’t exactly direct. She went through several professions first, including acting, producing commercials, and working as a school drama therapist with kids who suffered from ADHD, depression, and low self-esteem. 
 
“While working at the school, I realized how important proper food choices were,” she says. “I worked with kids on the importance of food choices, made snacks with them, and helped parents to add nutrient-loaded food into their children’s diets and get rid of sugar preservatives and artificial additives.” However, it wasn’t until a couple of years later, when her dad was diagnosed with cancer, that Lerman went back to school to study nutrition. “I realized helping people heal through food choices was my true calling,” she says. 
 
This creative yet practical approach that Lerman brought to her students guides how she cooks for her own children, as well. On her daughter’s first day of preschool, Lerman noticed how many of her classmates were eating unhealthy snacks. She started a blog, “ Snacking Outside the Box ,” for sharing her healthy recipes and cooking tricks, and started to bring treats into her daughter’s classroom to show that healthy cooking could taste good. 
 
“My daughter went to a preschool on the border of Harlem where many of the kids had never seen edamame or an avocado,” she says. “We made guacamole and edamame hummus. By teaching them to cook, we turned thier yucks into yums.” 
 
After her blog gained traction, Lerman tried to sell it as a book idea. But the response she received was largely: “That’s not your story. We want to hear about your family.” So she began writing about growing up with her fat dad for the New York Times’   “Well” blog , and the posts formed the basis for the book. 
 
Lerman was a little hesitant to explore her relationship with her father. She sent him chapters after she’d finished writing them so he could look them over, and calls the process “nerve-wracking.” However, her father’s response after reading the book was: “You’ve come a long way baby,” a tagline he’d created for Virginia Slims. 
 
Lerman has found that her story resonates with many; she’s received letters from people all over the world who’ve had a grandmother like Beauty or who had a parent who wrestled with extreme dieting. 
 
“My story is everybody’s story, and it could be your story, so the most important thing is trying to create good food memories around your kids, and be aware of the message you send to your children,” Lerman says. “Instill a love for food: For buying food, making food, eating food, and valuing what it does for your body. What we put in our body is how we’re going to live our lives. You’ve got to treat your body well.”

Source: US UAW Union – Press Release/Statement: 
 
Headline: Greetings to all UAW-Ford Members: 
 
This communication is to provide you – and especially our newer members for whom the bargaining process may be unfamiliar – an update on negotiations and where we are in that process. 
 
Typically, negotiations take place over a period of several months. Our members at each local were asked to participate in a strike authorization vote and overwhelmingly gave the International Union permission to call a strike when necessary. A strike is difficult and always the last resort when negotiations break down. We are not at that point. As you are aware, the current contract expired. We have agreed with the Company to extend the terms of the existing 2011 contract. This is not unusual and commonly occurs when either another company has been identified as the lead, as is the case here, or when a viable end is in sight and bargaining continues to progress. 
 
Numerous subcommittees have been negotiating specific aspects of the contract since July; most have reached tentative agreements. While we continue to meet on outstanding subcommittee issues, larger economic issues remain. 
 
Each round of negotiations presents its own unique challenges. We are determined to negotiate the best possible contract for our members while retaining good American jobs. 
 
While Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA US) is setting the pattern by negotiating first, we stand ready and able to complete our negotiations. As UAW President Dennis Williams and Vice President Norwood Jewell continue to bargain with FCA US, it is imperative that we, the UAW-Ford members, stand with our brothers and sisters at FCA US in solidarity and support. Our unity is our strength. 
 
Many entities against us are attempting to skew perception. I ask that you be cautious of the sources from which you receive your information and the material you choose to share. It is imperative that we are not misguided by rumors or misinformation. Again, unity is our strength. 
 
In the midst of negotiating the future of the American autoworker, solidarity is needed now more than ever. We cannot run at the first sign of trouble, nor jump to conclusions at every speculation. We remain in solidarity with you, our retirees and our brothers and sisters at FCA US and General Motors, and encourage you to do the same. 
 
We look forward to presenting a tentative agreement for ratification that meets the needs of our entire membership. 
 
In Solidarity, 
 
Jimmy Settles

5757,"Welcome to our new series, Foodie Friday! Pop in each week for our latest easy and  delicious recipe. Today’s is from our friends at Williams-Sonoma. 
 
Free for brunch this weekend? Try this easy Spring Veggie Tart. 
 
Why not lift your brunch game this weekend by gathering a few friends at home and celebrating the new season’s bounty? Cafés are great, but don’t overlook the virtues of entertaining at home – especially when you’ve got little ones in tow. This easy, versatile tart base is easy to load with whatever vegetables are stacked highest at the farmers’ market. Here, it’s elegant leeks and vibrant spring asparagus paired with pungent Fontina. Fontina is an Italian cheese with a delicious strong flavour that melts brilliantly. It’s available at most supermarkets and delicatessens, but if you can’t find it you could easily substitute Gruyère or provolone. Serve the tart warm from the oven with the usual brekkie sides, such as roasted baby tomatoes, mushrooms, bacon and great coffee (Champagne cocktails optional). 
 

 
Styling tip:  give your tart an extra glamorous edge by presenting it the same way the best food stylists do. Bring it to the table pre-cut on a generous, rustic chopping board lined with a piece of parchment or baking paper. Simple and chic. Just beware that your guests might show up again next week!

  1 sheet frozen puff pastry, about 250 g, thawed  1 cup (125 g) grated Fontina  15-20 thin asparagus spears, ends trimmed (thicker spears halved lengthwise)  1 small leek, white part only, halved and thinly sliced  2 eggs  1/4 cup (60 ml) full-cream milk  Salt and freshly ground pepper   
Method 
 
Preheat the oven to 200°C. Line a baking tray with parchment paper. Lay the puff pastry on the prepared tray. Fold over the sides to make a 2.5 cm rim, overlapping the pastry at the corners and pressing it lightly. Inside the rim, prick the pastry all over with a fork. 
 
Sprinkle half of the cheese over the bottom of the pastry inside the rim. Top with the asparagus, laying the spears vertically in a row from one side of the pastry to the other. Sprinkle the leeks over the asparagus. Bake for 15 minutes. 
 
Meanwhile, in a bowl, beat the eggs, milk, 1/2 tsp salt and several grinds of pepper until well combined. Remove the pastry from the oven. Pour the egg mixture evenly over the asparagus and leeks and sprinkle on the remaining cheese. Bake until the pastry is puffed and golden brown, about 10 minutes. Let the tart stand for 10 minutes before serving. Serves 4.

3100,"Stuart Lancaster praised England's try hero Mike Brown for lifting the team ""by the scruff of the neck"" to secure victory against Fiji - and a potentially crucial bonus point. 
 
The England head coach admitted however that the hosts will have to improve on their display in the opening match of the Rugby World Cup in their Pool A games against Wales and Australia. 
 
After an opening penalty try for England, Brown scored twice before Billy Vunipola crashed over for the fourth - and the bonus point - in the last play of the match. 
 
Lancaster, who described the atmosphere of the opening match as ""phenomenal"", said: ""I thought Browny was excellent. His ability to beat the first defender is a great trait and he inspires the team - he plays with such courage, pace and power. 
 
""He lifted the team by the scruff of the neck in the second half."" 
 
Lancaster admitted the introduction of replacements including Vunipola and his brother Mako, Owen Farrell and Sam Burgess had given England the final momentum - and put the substitutes in contention to start next weekend's meeting with Wales. 
 
He added: ""Yes I think they have. We always select one game at a time and the the bench really put their hands up and that's what you want them to do. With the quality of the team coming up against next week we need to be at our best and it's a big challenge against Wales. 
 
""The key messages are to play in the right areas of the field, trust the game will come to us and be more direct. We were too lateral in the first half and the players realised that. Billy, Mako and Sam came on and did well for us, provided quicker ball and that proved the difference in the end. 
 
""We need to improve, that's no doubt, but had we been offered four tries and the bonus point I would absolutely have taken that at the start of the game. 
   Promoted stories   
I think Fiji will cause every team problems. They play Australia next and then have an eight-day break before Wales."" 
 
Lancaster confirmed lock Geoff Parling had come off with an injury that was a ""mild stinger"" but that he would be fit for Wales. 
 
Fiji's head coach John McKee claimed England would have been disappointed with their display and would need to sharpen up for their big games with Wales and Australia. 
 
McKee said: ""We are a bit disappointed in the dressing room - we came here with high ambitions and felt we had England under pressure at times but critical turnovers and penalties allowed England to come back into the game and stopped us building any momentum.

1501,"An employee is suing a Plano-based business, alleging it failed to provide her and other employees with a minimum wage and overtime pay. 

Beth Degrassi, individually and on behalf of all others similarity situated, filed a lawsuit Aug. 24 in the Sherman Division of the Eastern District of Texas against Nicka & Associates Inc. of Plano, alleging violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act. 

According to the complaint, Degrassi worked for the defendant as medical coder for three years prior to the lawsuit. Although the FLSA mandates employees be paid a minimum wage, the suit states Degrassi and other medical coders were or are paid based on the number of files/cases they entered into the defendant's technology system. The plaintiff contends the production rate pay doesn't amount to what they would be paid under a minimum wage. 

The plaintiff also alleges she and other medical coders didn't receive overtime compensation when working more than 40 hours in a given week. She says the defendant's actions were done intentionally and willfully. 

Degrassi seeks unpaid minimum wages and overtime compensation, liquidated damages, attorney fees and court costs, and other relief deemed appropriate by the court. She is represented by attorney Chris R. Miltenberger of The Law Office of Chris R. Miltenberger in Southlake.

986,"A man involved in a road rage incident will await a psychiatric report before sentencing in December. 
             
A man will stay in custody at Hillmorton Hospital awaiting sentence after admitting running down a man in a road rage incident. 
 
During the remand, a psychiatric report will be prepared on how to deal with 51-year-old Andrew George McDaniel at his sentencing on December 15. 
 
The report was ordered along with a report on McDaniel's suitability for home detention when he pleaded guilty to five charges in the Christchurch District Court on Tuesday. 
 
The Swannanoa property developer was charged with injuring a man with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, and wilfully illtreating a dog by injuring it causing it pain to the extent that it was necessary to destroy the animal to end its suffering. He aced separate charges of assault, driving with excess breath-alcohol and careless driving. 
 
The most serious charges arose from an incident that took place on March 23, at the Eyre River crossing in Downs Rd, near Rangiora. 
 
McDaniel was driving a dark-grey four-wheel-drive Nissan. 
 
A man out walking the family's 10-month-old puppy, with his wife and two children at about 5.45pm, signalled to McDaniel to slow down when he drove out of the river crossing. 
 
McDaniel then manoeuvred the car with a series of u-turns to try to knock the man down. 
 
The man tried to avoid the vehicle by jumping over a fence but was struck and then the puppy was hit by the car as it drove away from the scene. 
 
The man received treatment for cuts to his hands from the fence, cuts and bruises on his head and injuries to his shoulder and ankle. The puppy was put down.

3669,"People who perceived themselves to be overweight were at greater risk of gaining weight in recent studies from the U.S. and the UK. 

This was true whether or not their perceptions were correct. 

They also were more likely to overeat in response to stress, which explained a large part of the weight gain, researchers say. 

In the past, it was assumed that if people considered themselves to be overweight, they would have greater motivation to change their diet or level of exercise, the researchers write in the International Journal of Obesity. 

However, they point out, feeling overweight can also be risky, as past studies have shown that people who feel discriminated against because of their weight are more likely to gain weight. 

Lead author Eric Robinson at the University of Liverpool in England told Reuters Health by email that his team ""wanted to test the common assumption that being ignorant to one's weight status is always a bad thing."" 

The researchers used data from three different studies to determine how people's perceptions of their own weight affected their weight gain in adulthood 

First, they used data on close to 4000 18- to 28-year-olds from the U.S. National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The study collected information on participants' body mass index (BMI), which is a ratio of weight to height, and their self-rating of their weight. 

The researchers also used demographic information to control for factors such as sex, age, race/ethnicity, education level, income, and health conditions. 

Around 40 percent of the participants considered themselves overweight - and these young adults were more likely to gain weight over a seven year period, averaging a 0.9 point increase in BMI. 

This was true regardless of whether those participants really were overweight. 

The researchers also looked at data from the UK's National Child Development Study, which followed 6,740 23-year-olds through to middle age. Thirty-eight percent believed themselves to be overweight at the start of the study. 

Again, both overweight and normal weight people who thought they were overweight were more likely to gain weight than people who didn't - about 0.8 points more in BMI on average over a 22-year period. However, this effect was stronger for people who actually were overweight initially. 

The study team sought to control for factors known to increase the risk of weight gain and found that the results were not due to outside psychological, health, or environmental factors. 

Finally, using data from 3,372 middle-aged people in the Midlife in the U.S. Study, the researchers assessed whether people perceiving themselves to be overweight would overeat in response to stress, and whether this would explain the weight gain. 

At the start, 67 percent of participants believed they were overweight- and these people gained an average of 0.3 more BMI points over a 9-10 year period, compared to those who didn't consider themselves overweight. Stress-induced overeating was found to explain a significant portion of the weight gain. 

Jane Wardle, a clinical psychologist at University College London, said by email that these findings are important because one public health strategy has been to make sure that people who are overweight are aware of it. 

Wardle, who studies weight perception, noted that people who believe they are overweight may delay their weight loss efforts. She said that, ""a person might decide they should definitely start a diet tomorrow and meanwhile finish the cookies."" 

Wardle advised that healthcare professionals can help people identify practical steps to lose weight that are not too difficult. 

Robinson is concerned about the findings. They ""may tell us something important about the experience of being an 'overweight' person in the 21st century,"" he said. ""It's rare for identification of a health issue to be associated with that issue becoming worse.""",0ab7834d-6213-40a2-adfa-5aca547f0859,News,2015-09-23T11:11:17Z,FOXNews.com,People who see themselves as overweight are more likely to gain weight,0.0,Blog

4076,", Dan Pitt , the Executive DirectorÂ of Open Networking Foundation (ONF) in California announced on ONF Member Workday, that five types of SDN switches produced by Huawei, ZTE, H3C and DCN had passed OpenFlow v1.3 conformance test implemented in BII Group-Global SDN Certified Testing Center (SDNCTC, www.sdnctc.com/en )  becoming the first batch of equipment toÂ pass the industry pioneering Â OpenFlow v1.3 conformance test. 
  
In recent years, as a new kind of network innovation framework, the software defined network (SDN) is considered as an important direction for the next-generation network revolution. The market acceptance of OpenFlow, as the southbound interface protocol standard of SDN, also increases rapidly. The ONF Certificate of Conformance, as the unique certificate to determine if testing equipment conforms to the OpenFlow standard in the Â current SDN market, is consistently recognized by professionals within industry. The acquisition of test certification can shorten the Â product development cycle, enhance the confidence of users, accelerate product deployment and promote competitive advantages in the market. At this time, as the first batch of switches obtaining ONF Certificate of Conformance in the world, Huawei CE6851-48S6Q-HI, ZTE ZXR10 M6000-S, H3C S6800, H3C S5130 and DCN DCRS-7604 will undoubtedly promote the maturity of the Â global SDN industry and accelerate the Â application process of SDN. 
 
It's worth mentioning that all of the OpenFlow v1.3 conformance tests are finished under the support of OFsuite, official test tool of ONF. Guided by the Global SDN Certified Testing Center, OFsuite is the first test tool in the world completely covering ONF OpenFlow v1.3 test specification. It can offer comprehensive support for automated test ing against equipment applying for the Â OpenFlow v1.3 Certificate of Conformance. Besides, with the Â abundant monitoring and diagnostic features of OFsuite, it's convenient to modify and upgrade the equipment during test ing . 
 
According to Mr. Li Zhen , director of the SDNCTC, ""The first batch of ONF OpenFlow v1.3 product certification shows that SDN product standardization has made a solid stride forward, and that the SDN products are ready to be deployed. Five devices from four vendors in China are the first in the world to be certified by OpenFlow v1.3,Â  an achievement brought about through the efforts by the coordination and collaboration between China SDN commission which Â has established an example for the global SDN industry. In the future, we will see more OpenFlow v1.3 certified products available on the market, giving an impetus to the development and improvement of the whole ecosystem across the entire industry.""

658,"A fire in York City that claimed the lives of a senior couple on Sunday was caused by an electrical fault and has been ruled accidental, authorities said. 

The early afternoon blaze started in the front room of the home in the 700 block of Tioga Street, where numerous electronics were plugged into a power strip, said David Michaels, the city fire chief. 

It's unknown whether the fire started at the power strip or the receptacle into which it was plugged, he said. 
 
Firefighters found Anthony and Connie Zorbaugh, 66 and 63 respectively, in the kitchen of their home after responding to a structure fire just after noon, according to the York County Coroner's Office. 

Michaels said firefighters entered the house in search of the couple and, after finding them, brought them outside and attempted to resuscitate them. But their efforts were unsuccessful. 

The Zorbaughs died of smoke inhalation and burns, the coroner's office announced on Monday. 

Michaels said Anthony Zorbaugh had ""significant health issues"" and had trouble moving around. It appeared that Connie Zorbuagh had been trying to help him get out, the chief said. 

The house is not a total loss, but damage is estimated at $45,000, the chief said.

881,"Sageworks’ new Electronic Tax Return Reader automatically imports data, improving efficiency and accuracy. 
 

The $2.1 billion, Briarwood, N.Y.-based Melrose Credit Union is giving rave reviews of its experience with the Raleigh, N.C.-based Sageworks’ new Electronic Tax Return Reader, which the credit union said helps improve underwriting efficiency. 

Sageworks introduced the Electronic Tax Return Reader as a major time-saving enhancement to its suite of credit risk management solutions for financial institutions. The complimentary upgrade automatically imports data from borrowers’ tax returns. 

“I am ecstatic with this product so far,” Steven Krauser, senior vice president of retail operations for Melrose CU, told CU Times . 

He explained that because the credit union's lending portfolio is so diverse, systematizing the evaluation of its underwriting process was a priority. Based on the NCUA's requirements, the credit union needed to provide the matrix for evaluating a loan in a standardized manner across all product lines. 

Krauser, who joined Melrose CU about a year ago, explained one of his goals was to study what the credit union could do better and began researching software that would allow him to do that. 

“We started in business in 1922 in taxi medallion financing,” Krauser said. “We have a significant portfolio in that. That is one reason we wanted to get involved in this.” 

The credit union also desired the ability to flag any problems in advance by adjusting and stress testing its portfolio, and to quantify and maintain its methodology. 

Melrose CU, which has an open charter and one branch, investigated which lending modules would integrate with its core system's existing data as well as standardize underwriting within its departments. The Sageworks suite, Krauser explained, allows the credit union to stress test its portfolio based on numerous factors such as loan to value, debt service coverage ratio changes and interest rate increases. 

The credit union started fully underwriting with the system on Aug. 4, 2015. 

“The quality of the underwriting analysis has increased dramatically,” Krauser pointed out, adding that the timesaving benefit will come later on. “The reason it is not there yet is that it is new and we’re still learning what to do, so there still is a learning curve.” 

Libby Berman, an analyst for Sageworks, said, “Our bread and butter at Sageworks has always been commercial loans and business lending, so the tax packages we support are mostly those commercial properties that accounting firms used for their businesses. We supply our financial institution clients with products that help them comply with regulations and improve their efficiency.” 

The Electronic Tax Return Reader works by optically “reading” electronic tax returns produced by many common tax packages, allowing for the creation of digital returns in the Sageworks system, where other financial information is also imported and stored. The program also benefits credit departments that analyze commercial real estate borrower information, as it also automatically populates Schedule E financial information for real estate properties. 

Sageworks said the enhancement allows credit unions to save a significant amount of time. 

“Our users are spending about 30 minutes per return on average, and obviously, some tax returns are much more complex with many real estate properties,” Berman pointed out. 

Through this program and its technology, that time can be pared down to two to three minutes, he said. 

“I don't know that a lot of our clients even knew this technology was feasible,” Berman added. “It has just been a recurring theme since we got into the credit analysis business, making sure that data was accurate and entered quickly. It is something people kind of expected. This will proactively solve most of those problems.” 

In addition to saving users time, the Electronic Tax Return Reader aims to reduce errors that can occur during the manual data entry process, and ensure consistency and accuracy during the production of commercial borrower spreads within the Sageworks Credit Analysis tool. For applicable tax returns, the technology ensures different analysts across an institution are inputting data the same way, which helps give credit unions a strong defense during exams. 

Berman said Sageworks also helps clients maintain consistency. 

“In the past, maybe there were multiple people entering data, and it is very easy to transpose numbers or enter something on the wrong line,” he explained. “The auto import helps eliminate inconsistencies and errors. The system also allows the financial institution the capability to go back in and make adjustments.” 

Melrose CU implemented Sageworks’ entire suite of cloud-based products about three and a half months ago, Krauser said. 

“Within that time, we were able to learn it, train our people, create a test site, play with it and then map our fields from our core system into the Sageworks system,” he noted. 

Krauser said Sageworks performs all calculations for Melrose CU. 

“It gives us the debt to service coverage ratio, loan to value and matrix on individual loans that we are doing, plus it gives us all the same information on global cash flow for those individuals and does it for our entire portfolio on that individual. So if you have a loan here and you are asking for a car loan, we can do the analysis on that car loan to see if it makes [financial] sense.” 

Currently, Melrose CU uses Sageworks’ tools for its commercial real estate department, taxi medallion lending area and business services unit. Krauser explained the credit union will eventually introduce Sageworks into its personal lending area as well, but first, it wants to gain full confidence using the tools for the largest portion of its lending business. 

“We have a real robust program here, and we want to make sure we have all the pieces and understand the full breadth and depth of it before we introduce it into other aspects,” Krauser said. “It is really a great automation of the process.” 

Scott Ogle, CEO for Sageworks, noted, “Sageworks offers solutions that simplify the complex processes that financial institutions handle every day. A key objective when developing or enhancing our solutions is to maximize time and efficiency. With our customer needs in mind, we developed the Electronic Tax Return Reader to become an integral component of each of our banking solutions, as it will save hours of manual data entry over the life of the solution.” 

Sageworks Credit Analysis allows credit unions to book loans faster, and with consistency and transparency, while also managing risk, the company said. The global cash flow analysis solution presents tax return input screens that create spreads, dynamic narrative analysis and customizable credit memos. 

“This is also important to those credit unions that are getting into more member business lending, who may not feel they have the right staff in place,” Berman asserted. “They can use a program like this to take care of some of the more manual work and allocate time more effectively to the actual analysis.” 

Berman pointed out the credit analysis tool also helps credit unions prepare for exams, especially those that had trouble in the past with credit decision inconsistencies and file errors.",3b985539-a695-4edd-826d-3b343967cef8,News,2015-09-18T04:00:00Z,Credit Union Times,Sageworks Automates Tax Data for Credit Unions,0.0,News

2909,"Silver Fern Farms has embarked on a national roadshow to sell farmers on the idea of bringing in China's Shanghai Maling Aquarius as a 50 per cent shareholder in its newly formed joint venture and the feedback so far has been ""overwhelmingly positive"", says chief executive Dean Hamilton. 

It had been ""standing room only"" at the first of the meetings held in the company's heartland provinces of Otago and Southland. 

He said he was confident that farmers would be in favour of the proposal, which will be decided by way of a simple majority, on October 16. Hamilton said he was also confident that the bulk of the company's supply base would stay with the co-op. 

While the response so far had been positive, questions asked at the meetings reflected a measure of concern about how the partnership would work and the protections that would exist, should Shanghai Maling want to go beyond 50 per cent. 

""I think we were able to allay those fears in terms of what exists in the shareholding agreement in terms of the inability to buy those shares in each other,"" he told the Herald. 

""We can't buy shares in Shanghai Maling and they can't buy shares in the co-op."" 

The meetings spent time going over the beef and lamb model, which has struggled to provide processors and farmers with an adequate return for several years. 

""Over the last 10 years we have lost money as many times as we have made money,"" Hamilton said. ""If you look at the profit 'pie' between the processor and the farmer, the pie is simply not big enough, so we can scrap around with it - they get a bit more of the pie one year and we can get more the next - but really it is the same small pie and one that is not creating a return for either of us."" 

Hamilton said farmers had come to the conclusion that the industry could not carry on the way it had been. 

Silver Fern has embarked on a ""plate to pasture"" value-added model in an attempt to move away from a purely commodities-driven business - the result which can be seen on New Zealand supermarket shelves. 

Now it wants to roll out its value-added model on the international stage, which is going to require additional capital. 

China is Silver Fern Farm's biggest customer by volume but ranks second, with 15 per cent, after the United States in terms of value. 

On intellectual property, Hamilton said the IP of the business would be contained within the partnership. 

Hamilton said quality food imported into China generally commanded a premium and Shanghai Maling wanted access to that end of the market. 

Debt has been a big issue for Silver Fern over the past 10 years. It swelled to around $350 to $400 million after the 2006 takeover of Hawkes Bay's Richmond Meats. It then shrank back to around $115 million before ballooning out to $380 million in 2013 when the bottom fell out of the sheepmeat market. 

""We have been in a cycle of lurching from crisis to crisis because ultimately, when you carry lot of debt, it only needs a change in the weather for it to get worse."" 

Hamilton said the infusion of $261 million from the deal would put the company in the best financial position since its inception in 1948. 

Silver Fern Farms made inroads into its debt mountain last year, knocking off $100 million, and made further progress in the current financial year, which ends this month, but its bankers had clearly lost patience with the company. 

""We were under clear riding instructions from the banks to continue to get that [debt] down. We have achieved that but we are still not where we wanted to be,"" Hamilton said. 

This financial year, which ends this month, Silver Fern expects its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to come in at around $75 to $85 million and to report a net profit before tax of about $20 million to $25 million, up from $2 million last year. 

Hamilton said he understood some farmers would opt to supply other meat companies, such as neighbouring Alliance Group. 

""At the end of the day, the ultimate casting vote sits with the farmers,"" Hamilton said. 

""They get to vote at the meeting and they get another vote in terms of what they do with their livestock,"" he said. 

""There will be some who do not support the transaction ... equally, there will be those who have not supplied Silver Fern Farms because of its lack of financial stability - that will disappear as we become financially the strongest red meat company in New Zealand."" 

Hamilton was not anticipating a large change in the supply base. 

The transaction values Silver Fern Farms' equity at $311 million.

2961,"Brig P K Langar (Retd) 
The Armed Forces is a profession of Arms which is nobler than any contemporary profession, for its ethos revolves around the fact that one is to lay down one’s life in line of duty to maintain the territorial sanctity of the nation. The Defense personnel are divorced from the niceties of the civil environments and are motivated and trained to get the better of the enemy in combat, both in peace and war, should the contingency arise. Military personnel are ‘Karam Yogi’ , whose Dharm is their duty to carry out assigned task in an extraordinary self less attitude. The ‘Izzat’ of their Unit and the Country is uppermost in their minds and they live and die to maintain its sanctity. 
Age old traditions and un-written laws which keeps morale of the soldiers high all through their active service and after retirement, assures them that the state would look after their interest when the times comes. This bond between the soldier and the State, and their faith in their superiors and vis-a-versa remain unfettered forever. This is the main reason that they reconcile with that fact that their Fundamental Rights ( So dear to their fellow countrymen) are curtailed by their respective Service Acts. The soldiers don’t voice their grievances in public even when they are not satisfied in their promotion prospects and the like.  This reinforces the fact that the State has to look after their well being religiously in a most effective manner. The day it does not happen and a Soldier has to demand for his legitimate dues, the incumbent Government would lose its credibility which could have serious ramifications in future. 
The case of One Rank One Pension (OROP) is very legitimate since the sustainability of the present and tomorrows ex-servicemen depends on implementation of OROP. To comprehend that the citizen and the Government must appreciate that the Armed Forces have a steep pyramid for promotion with no lateral expansion hence most of the officers and the Other Rank of the Defence forces retire between ages from late 30s to early 40s and are on pension to lead a decent life and cater to growing children’s requirements. The jobs offered by commercial organization are not in consonance with the status  of ex-servicemen and are often demeaning. 
The political leadership over the last 40 years has shown a lackadaisical attitude towards the soldiers demand by not implementing OROP in its totality. It’s fair to assume that the political leadership is influenced by the bias of bureaucracy, the latter caught in its own web of ulterior motives.  The ex-servicemen out of frustration for not getting their legitimate dues are on a peaceful protest and hunger strike for about 90 days. The Government while implementing OROP should not get involved in bargaining with the ex-servicemen, for it is not akin to a strike of by Labour Union of a PSU. If the implementation of OROP is further delayed it can lead to a fissure between political and military leadership which will be unfortunate and could impact working equation between the two in future. 
The political leadership is supreme in a democratic set up but it has to take military leadership on board to ensure turmoil free domestic constituency and maintaining sanctity of national borders and safety from external aggression. A powerful military force with high morale is inevitable in guarding national interest and asset, both inside and outside the country. Also a motivated strong military force is an extension of economically developed nation’s aggressive policy helping it to become a dominating nation in the world affairs. 
It’s on record that whenever the incumbent Government demanded, the Armed Forces Commanders had advised the former on the best military course of action and carried out the assigned task relentlessly to safeguard the sovereignty and integrity of the country. The Kashmir operation 1947-48, to throw back the Pakistani intruders, a strong repost to cripple Pakistani military machine in 1965 war, the liberation of Bangladesh to stop the oppressed refugees influx into our country and the Kargil Operation of 1999 are all examples in point and are testimony to the fine synergy between the civil and military leadership of the day. In all the above scenarios the bureaucracy was only in a support role and will remain the same in future also. 
We must appreciate objectively that today’s serviceman is tomorrow’s ex-serviceman and whatever be the final decision of the Government on implementation of OROP, it will impact the psyche of the future generations of the Armed Forces. 
Finally, the implementation of OROP is a political decision which rests duly on elected leaders of the day, who have the mandate to look after the welfare of its people and the Armed Forces. We hope that the undulated implementation of the OROP will satisfy and upkeep the honour of  the protesting ex-serviceman, who were front line soldiers yesterday and had fought the Righteous war to safe guard the honour, safety and welfare of the people of this country at the peril of their own lives.

3849,"A MAN who strangled a drunk and despondent woman for annoying him, then dumped her body in a Perth river, will spend at least 19 years behind bars.  
   
PETER Michael Bradshaw was to stand trial in July over the death of Janelle Kathleen Knox, but pleaded guilty at the last minute. 
The West Australian Supreme Court heard that Ms Knox and Bradshaw, both 34 at the time of the April 2013 attack, were with other Kelmscott hostel residents on the banks of the Canning River and all of them were ""very drunk"". The pair had been friends and Bradshaw had listened to Ms Knox's loud complaints about her life. She was homeless after being assaulted by her then-boyfriend and had been asked to leave the hostel for not paying her rent. Ms Knox was crying and being loud, saying she wanted to ""end it all"". ""That was getting to him,"" defence lawyer David McKenzie said during sentencing on Monday. Bradshaw started signalling his intent to the others, saying ""I can get rid of this problem"" and that he had ""fresh meat"" to use as bait while they fished for marron. Ms Knox was then strangled from behind with a rope and her body was dragged into the river. ""Initially you were there as her friend ... tragically, your attitude changed,"" Justice Lindy Jenkins said. ""Your motive was to rid yourself of a troublesome person who you say wanted to die anyway."" Bradshaw claimed he wasn't the only killer, and while Justice Jenkins said she could not be completely certain he was the sole attacker, she did not accept his version of events. Justice Jenkins said the crime was aggravated by the fact he tried to clean up the scene and stole his victim's personal belongings. Speaking with reporters outside court, Ms Knox's cousin Emma Knox said the family was satisfied with the sentence but had found it difficult listening to the evidence. ""I think it's a very appropriate sentence,"" she said. ""Nothing will ever bring her back though. Janelle ... was a diamond in the rough. She'll never be forgotten."" Ms Knox is survived by her eight-year-old son, who is living with family. ""We see a little bit of her in him.""",4d9ce464-99b2-45e3-9b1c-47f958c53aa9,News,2015-09-07T05:32:06Z,Gold Coast Bulletin,Man jailed for Perth strangling murder,0.0,Blog

433,"When the IPC originally formed their Code of Practice was quite progressive. The Prankster compared them favourably to to BPA in this blog. No doubt this conrtibuted to the DVLA awarding them provisional ATA status.
Since then the BPA have made large steps to become fairer to the motorist. The IPC on the other hand, did a Jekyll and Hyde as soon as they were awarded full ATA status by the DVLA. Since then their appeals service has become a joke, serving up institutionally biased results with poor understanding of parking-related and consumer law. Operators are allowed to submit false evidence and the IPC turn a blind eye.
Code of Practice
The IPC's true colours have emerged with the release of the latest version of their code of practice. It is worth comparing point by point with the previous version to show what happens when a rogue ATA is allowed to change its code without input or control from government.
Initial Audit
4.1 Initial compliance upon application for IPC membership is assessed by way of an Initial Audit
which, will be followed by a period of ‘probationary membership’ for 6 months this is
detailed further in Schedule 4.
4.1 Upon application for IPC Membership, compliance will be assessed by way of an Initial
Audit during a period of ‘probationary membership’ for the first 6 months. This is
detailed further in Schedule 4.
The audit no longer takes place before the member joins, but up to six months afterwards. This means the member has up to six months to operate without audited signage contracts and correspondence templates. At least two court cases taken out by IPC members have failed because the operator could not show a valid contract with the landowner was in place.
Investigation of Complaints
4.4 The IPC will investigate and record any complaints against members in order to ensure
compliance.
4.4 The IPC may investigate and record any complaints against members in order to ensure
compliance.
Complaints are not now always investigated. The Prankster has informed the IPC of several of their operators who breach the code of conduct. The IPC has refused to investigate. This can be contrasted with the behaviour our the BPA. When The Prankster informed them that UK PC were forging timestamps the BPA were reluctant to believe their members could do such a thing, but still investigated anyway. The IPC, according to their actions, are happy for their members to get away with whatever dodgy practice they like.
ANPR accuracy
3.3 ANPR equipment must be maintained and calibrated appropriately to ensure accuracy so as
to ensure that keeper data is not applied for without proper grounds for doing so. Where
there are manufacturer’s guidelines for the maintenance of equipment then this should be
followed.
The requirement to have accurate ANPR has been removed.
Sub Contractors
4.3 If you use sub-contractors or self-ticketing operators then you must ensure that they are
familiar with this code and obtain signed confirmation by them to this effect. You must
ensure that such confirmation is made available to the IPC during any audit or upon request.
The requirement for sub contractors to be familiar with the code has been removed.
Data Protection
5.2 Where required to do so you must provide the IPC with any such records in order that we
may monitor compliance with the Code and any applicable laws.
5.3 Failure to provide any such document(s) within 14 days will be treated as an issue of noncompliance under the Sanctions scheme.
The requirement to allow data protection compliance to be checked has been removed.
Internal Appeals
6.1.d) Allow recipients of a parking charge notice the ability to make representations to you
regarding the issue of the charge.
6.1.d) Allow recipients of a parking charge the ability to make representations to
you regarding the issue of the charge.
It is believed this change is so that operators do not have to allow keepers the right to appeal. This is analysed later.
Changes in terms and conditions
9.1 Where there is any change in the terms and conditions that materially affects the motorist
then you should make these clear on your signage. Where such changes impose liability
where none previously existed then you should consider a grace period to allow regular
visitors to the site to adjust and familiarise themselves with the changes. It is suggested that
a grace period of one month is appropriate and that during this period you should identify
vehicles that would have incurred charges under the new system where they wouldn’t have
previously and inform the driver by notice affixed to the vehicle that in future they will incur
a charge. Vehicles that return having previously had notice of these charges can then be
ticketed in the normal way at your discretion. More guidance on signage is found in
Schedule 1.
This protection has been removed.
Warning and court letters
15. Final Warning Letters
15.1 Where the charge remains unpaid and no appeal is lodged you may send a final
warning letter.
15.2 You must make it clear in the final warning what you will do next if payment is not
received and how payment can be made.
15.3 A final warning letter should not be sent until 14 days have passed since the
notification letter.
16. Court Action or Charge Recovery
16.1 When a final warning has been sent you must wait a further 14 days before you take
further action such as debt recovery or court action.
This requirement has been removed
Grace Periods
17.1 Drivers should be allowed a sufficient amount of time in order to park and read any
signs in order that they may make an informed decision as to whether or not to remain on
the site before any enforcement action is taken by you or your agents.
15.1 Drivers should be allowed a sufficient amount of time to park and read any signs so
they may make an informed decision as to whether or not to remain on the site.
Enforcement action can begin during the grace period.
Notice to Keeper
6.4 The keeper must be told that the process of appealing within your internal appeals process
and the IAS.
The requirement to allow keepers to be able to appeal has been removed. If a keeper appeals a notice to driver, they get this reply:
Later on, when the notice to keeper arrives, the right to appeal is no longer present.
The right of a keeper to appeal is a fundamental protection. It was a clear condition of government that the motorists should have access as a condition of the Protection of Freedoms Act Schedule 4 going live. The Prankster believes that ATA status should be removed from the IPC until the right for keepers to appeal has been restored.
Entrance Signs
Signs must, where practicable, be placed at the entrance to a site.
Signs should, where practicable, be placed at the entrance to a site.
Entrance signage is no longer mandatory. A large number of IPC members do not bother with entrance signage. Standardised entrance signage is an important part of car park management, alerting motorists that terms and conditions apply and so they must look out for further signs. Doing away with this requirement boosts parking charge numbers and increases revenue for operators.
This is another huge retrograde step by the IPC, and shows their intention is not to provide a true car park management service, but to catch motorists out in order to make more money for their members.
Standard Wording
You should endeavour to use the following standard wording on your entrance signs. You should
include a minimum of one phrase from Group A (but no more than 3). Group A text should be before
and more prominent than the Group B text. The signs must direct motorists to the more detailed
signs which display the full terms and conditions. This is important as it is these terms and conditions
that will provide the legal foundation to any charge.
Group A
Pay and display [free for blue badge holders]
[x minutes/hours] free parking [for customers only]
Pay on exit
Pay [on foot/at machine] when leaving
Parking for [business name] customers only
Permit Holders Only
Group B
Charges apply [after this]
Private land
Terms and Conditions Apply
See the notice[s] [in car park] for conditions
This requirement has been removed. The use of standard wording helps motorists.
Text Size
The height of the capital letters in the text from Group A will be dependent on the anticipated
approach speed of traffic. You should have reference to the table below in calculating the text size.
Group B text should be at least 50% of the size of Group A text. All other text should be smaller than
50% of the text from Group A. The name of the site and a welcome message can also be displayed
on the sign but should not detract from the prevalence of the Group A and Group B text.
The sign must be readable from far enough away so that drivers can read all of the Group A and
Group B text without needing to look more than 10 degrees away from the road ahead. Any text on
the sign which is not intended to be read from a moving vehicle can be of a much smaller size.
The size of text on a sign will be determined by a number of factors such as the position of it,
to whom it is aimed and the information that it needs to convey. Text should be of such a size
and in a font that can be easily read by a motorist having regard to the likely position of the
motorist in relation to the sign.
The definition of text size has been removed so that members can use whatever size they like. Large numbers of IPC signs have tiny fonts containing onerous terms and conditions. Allowing their members to hide conditions like this boosts revenue at the expense of motorists.
One of the IPC's biggest customers is Excel Parking/Vehicle Control Services whose signs routinely fail these requirements. At one of their biggest money spinners, Liverpool Airport, the font size is 30mm instead of the previously required 120mm. It is of course, unreadable from a moving vehicle.
Upsetting Excel would be a bad move for the IPC so it is a reasonable guess that this change was a result of a request by them.
Signage in the Dark
If parking enforcement takes place outside of daylight hours, the sign itself is not illuminated or
there is not sufficient ambient lighting, it should be made of retro-reflective material meeting BS EN 12899-1:2007 class RA2 or higher (BS EN 12899-6:2012 class P3 or higher). Dark-coloured areas need not be reflective. You need to ensure that all signs are readable during the hours of enforcement as they form the legal basis of any charge. If signs cannot be read then resulting charges that depend upon their content will not be enforceable.
If parking enforcement takes place outside of daylight hours you should ensure that signs are
illuminated or there is sufficient other lighting. You will need to ensure all signs are readable
during the hours of enforcement as they form the legal basis of any charge.
The requirement to conform to standards has been removed. The pesky condition that unreadable signs cannot be enforced has been removed.
Repeater Signs
You are required to provide a sufficient number of signs on each site commensurate with its size and
other characteristics to ensure that motorists can be under no doubt as to the fact that parking
restrictions exist.
You are required to provide a sufficient number of signs on each site commensurate with its
size and other characteristics to ensure that any parking conditions are adequately brought to
the attention of the motorist.
The requirements for repeater signs have been relaxed.
Other Signs
6) Contain text that is appropriate to the position of the sign and the relative position of the
person who it is aimed at. So, if a sign is at an entrance of a site and the vehicle is likely to be
moving, it must be sufficiently large so as to be clear from within the vehicle having regard
to the likely speed that the vehicle will be travelling at that point.
6) Contain text appropriate to the position of the sign and the relative position of
the person who it is aimed at.
These safeguards have been weakened.
Changes in Operator’s Terms and Conditions
Where there is any change in the terms and conditions that materially affect the motorist then you
should place additional (temporary) signage at the entrance making it clear that new terms and
conditions/charges apply. The signage should be in addition to the signage ordinarily required.
Where there is any change in the terms and conditions materially affecting the motorist you
may place additional (temporary) signage at the entrance making it clear that new terms and
conditions/charges apply, such that regular visitors who may be familiar with the old terms
do not inadvertently incur parking charges. This signage should be in addition to the signage
ordinarily required.
The requirement has been weakened.
Sanctions
Using Predatory Tactics 8-12
Using Predatory Tactics 6-12
Sanction Points have been watered down
Audit
Where an operator has more than 60% of their Parking Charge Notices dismissed on appeal within a
rolling 3 month period, the IPC will investigate the operator and their practices to identify any areas
of non-compliance and will report to the parking operator on their findings. The IPC will usually
endeavour to work with the operator in resolving any compliance issues. The IPC may, whether or
not it assists in resolving issues with the operator, invoke compliance measures where appropriate.
Each year the IPC will randomly select 20-50 Parking Charge Notices issued by an operator to check with compliance with the relevant legislation and the Code of Practice.
Where an operator has more than 60% of their parking charges cancelled on appeal to the IAS
within a rolling 3 month period, the IPC may investigate the operator and their practices to
identify any recurring areas of non-compliance and will report to the parking operator on their
findings. The IPC will usually endeavour to work with the operator in resolving any compliance
issues. The IPC may, whether or not it assists in resolving issues with the operator, invoke
compliance measures where appropriate.
The requirements have been weakened.
Parking Charges
However, if the motorist uses the land other than in accordance with the terms and conditions then
they agree to pay a fixed fee by way of damages to the operator. This is based on a genuine preestimate of loss that flows from the breach of contract by acting otherwise than in accordance with the terms of the agreement the motorist entered into when deciding to park.
All parking charges must be reasonable.
However, if the motorist uses the land in breach of the terms and conditions they thereby agree to pay a fixed fee by way of damages to the operator.
All parking charges must have good legal foundation
The requirement to be a genuine preestimate of loss has been removed. Parking charges noi longer need to be reasonable.
Conclusion
It is obvious that every change has been made to the detriment of the motorist and without good reason. This is what happens when the DVLA allows a rogue ATA to have full control of its code of practice. The Prankster therefore backs the BPA's call for a single industry-wide code of practice, maintained by an independent body.
Until the IPC gets its house in order and reverts back to a fair code of practice, restoring at least signage requirements, and the ability for keepers to appeal, the DVLA should suspend its ATA status.

    Downtown Asheville is filled with funky shops such as LOFT, short for ""lost objects, found treasures."" 

 

Asheville has a unique character, with its dozens of locally owned shops and restaurants drawing more than nine million tourists annually. Now, fears that national retailers are ready to pounce on the central business district are prompting talk of a possible ban on chain stores. The controversy stems from plans by Anthropologie, which sells women’s clothing and home decor items at more than 200 stores, to add a shop on North Lexington Avenue. It would join a store owned by its Philadelphia-based parent company, Urban Outfitters, which is among a handful of chains in the downtown area. Almost 90% of downtown Asheville’s businesses employ fewer than 20 people. To preserve that local flavor, Asheville Downtown Commission member Rebecca Hecht started an online petition urging officials to either regulate or place a moratorium on chain stores downtown. “Allowing large chain and formula stores downtown will eliminate the unique appeal at the core of Asheville’s identity,” the petition says. “These types of businesses will erode what we value as a community and patina our image of a city that supports small business.” Supporters worry that downtown Asheville could resemble King Street in Charleston, S.C., a haven for national retailers. “As Asheville grows, we ought to put measures in place to protect and grow our local businesses, retain and strengthen our neighborhoods and put our locals first,” Franzi Charen, director of Asheville Grown Business Alliance, wrote in an email to supporters. Her group promotes local companies. The love-the-locals effort faces a stumbling block in state laws that limit the ability of municipalities to add zoning restrictions on chains. Another issue is how to define a chain. Downtown Asheville doesn’t have a Starbucks — the Seattle-based giant has chosen not to open a store there — but some businesses have other locations, including Tupelo Honey Cafe, Kilwins chocolate shop and Mast General Store, says Meghan Rogers, director of the Asheville Downtown Association. The city council hasn’t taken up the issue. Rogers cites better parking, a grocery store and more retail choices as top needs for downtown. While the association has not taken a side on the issue of restricting chains, she agrees that the local focus is popular. “I think a big reason people enjoy downtown Asheville is that it is different.”

557,"Feast of St. Matthew, Apostle, Evangelist   REACHING OUT TO THE UNCHURCHED   “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” – Matthew 9:11   At The Feast (the weekly prayer gathering of the Light of Jesus Family), we welcome everyone — the holy, the broken, and all sorts of people that Jesus used to minister to in His days. In fact, Bo Sanchez, The Feast founder, intended it to be a place where the “unchurched” can experience God’s love for them. That’s why it’s held in commercial places such as mall cinemas.        Through the testimonies that I, as managing editor of Kerygma magazine, have been receiving from Feast attendees, I can say that, truly, God is using it to extend His love to the people who are away from Him.        An example is Faye, a practicing lesbian then, who is now happily married to a man and is serving God through one of Bo’s media ministries. The unconditional love she received from a caring group at The Feast made her see her true identity as a daughter of God.        Jesus’ style. Pope Francis’s style.

5978,"A woman was arrested in Rogers on Sunday for not turning in three library books, according to the Rogers City Prosecutor’s Office. Megan Owens-Jordan was arrested on suspicion of theft of rental property,  handcuffed and told she had a $3,000 bond Sunday, Owens-Jordan and Keith Foster with the Rogers Police Department told 40/29 News. Police released her with a written citation and court date after they learned the warrant had been issued on three overdue library items, Owens-Jordan said. Owens-Jordan admitted to 40/29 News she had checked out The Lego Book, the Everyone Worth Knowing audiobook and the Husbands audiobook, and had not returned them.  “I understand them wanting their books and/or money. That is valid. I just don’t get that it is potential jail time for 3 books,” Owens-Jordan told 40/29 News. The Rogers Public Library only refers overdue items to prosecutors after writing at least 4 letters or e-mails to the person with the overdue items and calling them at least once, according to Judy Casey, Rogers Public Library Director. Owens-Jordan told 40/29 News she moved last August and may not have gotten those letters. She told 40/29 News she did not get a phone call. The library takes theft seriously because people are taking taxpayer property, said Casey. It can also make it difficult for taxpayers who wish to use the property that is missing, said Casey. The library has asked for 10-15 warrants to be issued on overdue items since the beginning of 2014, according to Bonnie Bridges, Staff Attorney with the Rogers Attorney’s Office. Most of the time, the cases are dropped when people either return the items or pay to replace them, Bridges said. The library told the city attorney’s office the replacement cost of the items is $279.50, Bridges said. The library usually pays a higher price for items than what you would see on Amazon or at Barnes Noble, Casey told 40/29 News. That is because the library gets special editions that are more durable than ones available at retail, said Casey. Many items, especially audiobooks, often come with warranties, said Casey.

2422,"THOUSANDS of Young people are flocking to Preston this week as the new university year gets underway.

Among the freshers at the University of Central Lancashire are more than 600 overseas students from over 120 different countries.

As Welcome Week - as Freshers is now known, the new international students from countries including China, Lithuania, the USA, Oman and Poland, received a warm welcome with a host of activities designed to introduce them to British culture. 

This included walking and cycling tours around the city, 10 - pin bowling and a traditional afternoon tea.

Pauline Kirijanovaite, a 20-year-old student from the Lithuanian Academy for Theatre and Music, will spend a semester at UCLan. 

She said: “So far I have loved everything about UCLan and Preston. 

“I want to make the most of my time here, both in regard to my studies and through meeting new people and travelling to new places.”

Sheryas Dhavileswanapu is from Dubai and about to start a three-year degree in games design.

He said: “I’ve been to the UK before but never to the North of England so it’s something completely new and exciting. I’m really looking forward to getting started.” 

Besides an introduction to the social welcome activities, the international students have been provided with access to a buddy to help them settle in.

The buddies are either a current student or recent graduate who is multi-lingual and knows the university and Preston very well.",d6387afa-50ec-4c62-830b-5632e8121468,News,2015-09-15T10:10:50Z,Lancashire Evening Post,Students arrive from  overseas,0.0,News

3738,"I have to level with you. I have never really understood all the drama about crossbows. Nothing short of when to open spring turkey season or the ever popular myth of fish and game departments stocking coyotes seems to draw more controversy than hunting with a crossbow. Why that is I am not sure, but I think it might be because it is not a traditional hunting weapon for many of us. 
  
Dad and Grandad did not hunt with a crossbow, so most of us look at it with more than a little suspicion. Maybe if we talk about it a little you might begin to see that the crossbow is neither a super weapon made to wipe out the deer herd nor an instrument of evil. It’s just another way for many people to get out there and hunt and enjoy the outdoors. 
 
In case you didn’t know, the crossbow has been around a long time and seems to have appeared at about the same time, around 400 BC, in both China and Europe. As soon as the crossbow was invented some of the regular bowmen, the guys with long bows, started complaining about how the crossbow was bad, it wasn’t safe and it gave those troops too much of an advantage. (OK, I made that part up.) 
 
What is true, however, is that there has been a dispute among archers for years about taking the crossbow afield. Some of the same concerns that I joked about always come up when this discussion starts. The critics maintain the crossbow is unsafe, it gives a hunter unfair advantage, there will be more deer killed during the archery season and this will cause the season to be shortened, and having crossbows around will make it easier for more deer to be taken illegally. 
 
Ohio and Arkansas were two of the first states to legalize crossbow hunting (they started in the 1970s), and none of the above concerns have come to light. There was no great increase in accidents, no shorter bow seasons and no noticeable uptick in poaching. The sky did not fall because they and now other states allowed crossbow hunting. Like many things in life I think a lot of us say we don’t like crossbows because we really don’t know anything about them. We have never shot one and never had one in our hands. 
 
One of common misconceptions about crossbows is that they have the capacity to shoot accurately at incredible distances, somewhere between a .22/250 varmint rifle and a ballistic missile. Once you explore the facts, however, you see that this is not the case. 
 
“We have done side by side comparisons between our crossbows and some of the industry leaders in vertical archery gear,” said Barbara Terry, the education and trade show coordinator for Ten Point Crossbow Technologies. “In these tests, we have shown that crossbow arrows will drop faster than other arrows because they are generally shorter and heavier than those used with vertical archery.” 
 
As with many other crossbow manufacturers, Barbara Terry advises to keep your shots with a crossbow at reasonable ranges, 40 yards and less. Since most of us are poor at judging distance, I suggest you invest in a range finder. 
 
“The close proximity required to kill a deer with a crossbow surprises a lot of gun hunters,” she said. “Being able to control your scent and watching the wind, estimating distances and shot placement. Some new crossbow hunters may get discouraged when they discover that the crossbow is not the super weapon they thought it was. Crossbow hunting is not as easy as it’s made out to be. It’s just one more way to get out in the woods and enjoy what we all like to do.” 
 
I agree with Barb Terry. The key here is if allowing the use of crossbows for the general public will get more people out there hunting, young and old, it is a good thing. Studies show that this has been the case in other states that have allowed crossbow hunting. Many report that after some hunters try crossbow hunting they move on to try more conventional archery. All of this is good as we try to increase hunter numbers. 
 
Can you get hurt with a crossbow? Absolutely. Just like a rifle, a shotgun, a conventional bow or any weapon, there is a danger here if we are not always careful. Good Hunter Education training followed by close attention to detail and following the rules we learned in our training is very important. 
 
You can try the crossbow for yourself, or not. I am only saying that if more us try the crossbow our hunter numbers will increase. I will predict that if you decide to try one and shoot it a few times, most of you are going like it!

Crossbow safety tips 
 
• Your crossbow is required to have a safety, use it. 
 
• Just like a firearm, keep the loaded crossbow pointed in a safe direction — at all times. 
 
• Read up on your crossbow and thoroughly familiarize yourself with the weapon before going afield. 
 
• When hunting from a tree stand, cock your crossbow on the ground. Climb into the stand and carefully pull up the crossbow with your haul rope. Reload the crossbow once you are securely in the stand with safety straps attached. 
 
• When stalking, moving on the ground, carry your crossbow unloaded, load when you spot your game. 
 
• A loaded crossbow in or on a vehicle is illegal and very dangerous. 
 
• Crossbows are not meant to be dry fired.   Crossbow rails should be lubed often and the string waxed as well. If you have a frayed string on your crossbow, replace it at once. 
 
• Keep your fingers and thumbs below the rail of the crossbow before you release the arrow. Any of your digits left above the rail at the shot may not be with you after the shot.",d90581f3-37cb-4ff9-8d02-988205b58c96,News,2015-09-02T10:00:00Z,Meadville Tribune,Crossbows: Instrument of Evil or just another way to enjoy hunting?,0.0,Blog
1942,"You just picked up some delicious takeaway, but you can’t dig in quite yet. Maybe you have to walk the dog, shoot off a quick email, or wait for someone else to get home. You can stick the takeaway in your microwave and close the door so it stays warm and tastes freshly cooked. 
 
You’re not actually turning the microwave on, however, just using the microwave as a way to insulate the food. Christine Gallary at The Kitchn tested the tip with glasses of water to see if the microwave does help, and it turns out it might buy you some serious time. No matter what you’re going to lose a lot of heat, but using the microwave as your takeaway storage can extend that “fresh takeaway window” by at least half an hour. Compared to setting in on the counter, where your food will start to rapidly cool instantly, it’s pretty helpful. If you have to wait for too long, though, you can always reheat it to make it taste as good as new.

3511,"Fully deserving of its Oscar and Golden Globe award nominations, Zaza Urushadze’s affecting drama Tangerines (2013) is a bittersweet portrait of cruelty and compassion in the midst of war. During the bloody conflict between Georgia and Abkhazia that erupted in the wake of the Soviet Union’s dissolution, many Estonians living in the region were forced to flee. Tangerines focuses on two immigrant farmers who have remained on their land in order to harvest a tangerine crop. A skilled carpenter, Ivo (Lembit Ulfsak) makes the crates, while Margus (Elmo Nüganen) picks the fruit from his orchard.

When a gun battle take place on the dirt track outside their homes, they rescue two wounded soldiers from opposing sides. Ahmed (Giorgi Nakhashidze) is a tough Chechen mercenary fighter, while Niko (Mikheil Meskhi) is a Georgian actor who left a promising theatre career because he felt duty bound to take up arms. As the pair recuperate from their wounds, under the care of Ivo, Margus and their doctor friend Juhan (Raivo Trass), Ahmed and Niko are forced to confront their mutual hatred and desire for vengeance. Gradually, though, influenced by Ivo’s placidity and kindness, they come to recognise the futility of war, the ethnic divisions that fuel the conflict and their shared humanity. Both are put to the test when random battalions of soldiers pass by Ivo’s home.

It’s a relentlessly male world. No women appear in the film, which underscores the men’s isolation. A photograph of Ivo’s granddaughter serves as a symbolic reminder of his family’s absence. The music adds an extra layer, in particular the conflicting tastes of Ahmed and Niko which causes further heated exchanges, while Niaz Diasamidze's evocative score contributes to the elegiac mood. Rein Kotov’s stunning cinematography captures the bleakness and beauty of the terrain. Ulfsak is superb as the even-handed carpenter harbouring his own secrets and pain. Nakhashiez gives an utterly convincing portrait of a mercenary brutalised by war who, despite his macho posturing, finally earns our sympathy. Except for the gun battles, nothing very much happens until the film’s closing moments but the pitch-perfect performances and Urushadze’s careful unwinding of the story ensure Tangerines is never less than riveting.

3369,"A phobia is a fear of a particular thing or situation.  It is a fear that is so intense that one suffers anxiety because of it.  Anxiety is that sense of dread and/or panic that is felt that causes them to suffer from a variety of physical discomforts  including trembling, nausea, difficulty breathing, and a variety of other sensations.  In general, people suffering from anxiety phobia disorders tend to feel an impending sense of doom that prevents them from further facing their fear. 
 
Fear isn’t uncommon.  When the body feels fear it triggers a fight or flight response by releasing hormones which cause the heart and blood pressure to rise, blood to be rerouted from the stomach and internal organs to the limbs, respirations increase and senses are heightened. 
 
When this fear is consistent and prevents or restricts a person from doing something it becomes a phobia.  There are two specific types of anxiety phobia disorders.  There are specific phobias and social phobias. 
 
Specific phobias are the result of a life experience and other biological factors.  It is the fear of a certain type of activity or thing.  For instance a person can develop a phobia of germs, blood, bugs, flying, driving, heights or any other situation or thing. 
 
There are over 19 million people who suffer from specific phobias.  Interestingly this condition happens twice as often in women as in men.  Many of the specific phobias begin in childhood and can be a result of a traumatic event, or what is perceived as a traumatic event. 
 
The other type of anxiety phobia disorder is a social phobia.  These are the result of being in situations that deal with performance and social activities.  This is also sometimes known as social anxiety disorder.  These social phobias affect of 15 million people.  In this instance both men and women are affected equally and again start in childhood. 
 
A person with a social phobia is fearful of being judged by others.  Things like public speaking can cause the person suffering from a social phobia to feel nauseated, tremors, rapid heartbeat and begin to sweat profusely.  Some other common fears are eating in front of people for fear they will choke or cause a type of embarrassment. 
 
There are those unfortunate few who suffer from both anxiety phobia disorders  specific and social phobias.  They will go to great extremes to avoid being put into a social situation that will cause them anxiety.  As with other mental disorders people suffering from anxiety phobia disorders will avoid seeking help. 
 
If the person seeks help from their primary care physician they will probably find that they are referred to a psychologist, psychotherapist or psychiatrist who can offer counseling and medication to help treat the disorder.  Treatment can also consist of behavioral modification, family counseling, individual counseling, group support and stress management. 
 
With the proper support medically, psychologically and emotionally people with anxiety phobia disorders are often able to learn to control their fears so they are well equipped to handle situations and events.  This leads them to a more normal and productive life.

Ball State gained 181 yards on the ground against Northwestern on Sept. 26, led by Riley Neal, Darian Green and James Gilbert. The Wildcats had only allowed 110 yards per game before playing the Cardinals. DN PHOTO ALLISON COFFIN 
   
On the surface, Ball State's 24-19 loss at No. 17 Northwestern doesn't seem like a bad one based on the Wildcats' prowess. 

Northwestern was a clear favorite in the game, and many people probably picked Ball State to get blown out. 

Ball State controlled most of the game, however, and either tied or outscored Northwestern in three quarters on Sept. 26. Missed chances and the Wildcats' big third quarter doomed the Cardinals in the loss. 
 
“Again, not a bad effort by any means,"" head coach Pete Lembo said. ""But one where we needed to make a few more plays in six or seven different situations."" 

After taking an early 3-0 lead against the nation's No. 10-ranked defense coming in, Ball State got the ball back after a turnover on downs. They pushed the ball down the field, but freshman Morgan Hagee missed a 43-yard field goal. 

Hagee missed two field goals in the game, finishing 2-of-4. 

Just a few drives later, the Cardinals were knocking on the door again. A 34-yard James Gilbert run took the ball to the 4-yard line to end the first quarter. 

But quarterback Riley Neal, in the first start of his career, fumbled the snap while attempting to hand it off, and the Wildcats recovered 

Another chance to extend the lead, another costly mistake. Neal agreed with Lembo that it may have been the difference in the game. 

“If I [didn't] fumble that ball on the 5-yard line, we’d have more points on the board,” Neal said. “We left plenty of points on the field where it should have been a different ball game.” 

Ball State's defense stood up to Northwestern by forcing four turnovers. They gave up a big touchdown in the second quarter and 17 points in the third, but gave the offense good chances to put points on the board. 

The Wildcats had turned the ball over just three times coming into the game. 

“Our defense played well enough that if were able to get those 14 points, [we'd be] a little bit happier right now — a lot happier right now,” Lembo said. 

Still, after the Wildcats' big third quarter, the Cardinals had their chances.  

They put together one touchdown drive in the second half, but failed to take advantage of short field on a few occasions. 

While there were positives — Ball State fared better offensively against Northwestern than Stanford or Duke — the combination of mistakes added up in defeat. 

Lembo knows this was a game that his team had every opportunity to win, but couldn't pull through. The Cardinals (2-2, 1-0) can take the positives from this game, however, and carry them into the rest of their Mid-American Conference schedule. 

Ball State will face another tough test next week against Toledo, who sits right outside the top 25 after a 3-0 start with wins against Arkansas and Iowa State.",e38ec51b-82b9-451b-8829-9cadf1ef433d,News,2015-09-27T22:49:30Z,Ball State Daily News,"Turnovers, mistakes take away from strong performance",0.0,News

Only after the intervention of a courageous young whistleblower-leaker, competitive China and cantankerous Russia has some of our government's representatives begun to acknowledge that our government's secret surveillance initiatives require constraints.
Our government representatives' acknowledgement that its secret surveillance initiatives require constraints is a good beginning. However, the acknowledgement must be coupled with government transparency, significant whistleblower-leaker reforms and inviolable reporter shields, but that will require the intervention of our increasingly concerned citizenry.

Mr. President, we're not surrendering tools for tracking terrorists.

Not any set of tools which an unconstrained, unmeasured, and unaccountable national security community can dream up or imagine might possibly be useful for tracking terrorists. It's unfortunate that our national security community has behaved with such recklessness that it has jeopardized, if not entirely forfeited all its credibility.
Yet, another ""national security plea"" is unlikely to restore that lost credibility.

UPDATED 06/06/2014 Guardian, Pentagon report: scope of intelligence compromised by Snowden 'staggering'
After every transparency event (leak) our intelligence community or government spokesperson will always assert that the ""compromise"" has caused ""serious"" (term used when transparency event involves documents classified secret) or ""grave"" (term used when transparency event involves documents classified top-secret) damage.
These are reactionary assertions that occur by definition of the leaked document's classification level. Asserting otherwise would be to acknowledge that the secret or top-secret document was improperly classified!
Those familiar with our classification system: will not assume any document is properly classified; will be routinely amused by the quantity and quality of improperly classified documents; will discount all G-Gordon-Liddy-like pronouncements of ""serious"" or ""grave"" damage, which are supported by reams of redacted pages; and will be staggered, not by the results of a transparency event, but by the sums spent on secret and opaque governance!

Kudos to our President and DOJ for obviating the traditional ""spy vs spy"" extrajudicial approach that has balefully prevailed among nation states—nations need not publicly protest but rather publicly present facts to a routinely convened court of law complying with common international standards.
Some proponents of partially perpetuating the ""spy vs spy"" extrajudicial paradigm make the illusory distinction between economic and non-economic spying—asserting the former purpose is impermissible while the later is ok?
The illusion works only if you think there exists a bright line between our government spies and our private enterprises—such a bright line does not exist.
For example, suppose our intelligence collectors physically or virtually collect an exotic piece of hardware, firmware or software—the collectors will directly or indirectly use our private enterprises to analyze and understand that hardware, firmware or software. If the collected hardware, firmware or software advances the state of art (improbable but not impossible, if you're collecting against mostly developing nations) our private enterprises will economically and non-economically exploit that advance.

Unsurprisingly, those erecting and perpetuating our opaque secret national security hydra find it difficult to articulate the benefits from the bulk collection of communications. One suspects that quantifying, measuring and monitoring other individual components of our opaque secret national security hydra would quickly demonstrate a similar lack of benefits, likely by orders of magnitudes.
Unfortunately, in the absence a transparent national security apparatus we must learn these data, after the fact, from whistle-blowers and leakers. How much better for our nation if our citizens openly discussed and debated the benefits and burdens, before the fact?

1. Fortunately, disclosure of dysfunctional environments has become more common. However, a perpetrator rarely appreciates, acknowledges or learns from these disclosures, so it may be necessary to protect a discloser from retaliation.
2. Part 2 opens with a couple of cheap shots by career NSA Snowden Leak Task Force Coordinator, Rick Ledgett. Outsiders familiar with the paranoid and pathological environments existing within our national security apparatus will amusingly recall the asymptotic mental compartmentalization that's required for a  25 year veteran insider to criticize unusual behavior (viewing a video terminal under black felt) and stealing secrets (key to a test) for advantage!
Part 2 closes with head spook General Keith B. Alexander's statement on the increased probability of terrorism.
Between Part 2's opening and closing is a continuing NSA promo that could be titled the ""Refocusing on NSA Basics, Really!"". How NSA lost its focus, constraints and measures will require another James Risen tome (perhaps a well resourced joint endeavor with James Bamford!).
 3. Additions simply increase the number of  possible failure paths.
4. Even more substantial and significant shifts will be required to accommodate the citizenry of modern civil societies. It's not without irony that those whose information is, has been, or will be bulk collected by our government are not participating in the hearings (e.g. German Chancellor Merkel).

Cost-benefit analyses must replace chants of ""the terrorists are coming"" and ""God [insert your favorite verb] America"".
7. Of course if our government could govern transparently there would be no espionage prosecution and thus no need for a public interest defense.
8. It can be useful to view government governance on a coercion-consent continuum with greater government coercion required to sustain greater societal imbalances.
A decaying government will ignore destabilizing societal imbalances and cite these destabilizing societal imbalances as justification for utilizing greater government coercion, thereby accelerating its further decay and eventual destruction.",afaf0ec8-9cd5-4ab3-9b4b-6e3b49947455,Blog,2015-09-17T16:17:54Z,Exaphone,The Least Secretive Of Nations Is The Strongest Of Nations Update-2,1.0,News

2881,"As if the rash of shootings along a busy stretch of Interstate-10 in downtown Phoenix wasn't bad enough, authorities now may have a copycat on their hands. 
 
That's a real possibility after two additional shootings -- not on I-10 but along roadways elsewhere in the Arizona capital -- late Thursday morning. A source with direct knowledge of the investigation said this may be someone trying to emulate the earlier shootings. 

For now, though, police are investigating the latest incidents as separate shootings, having not definitively linked them to the earlier cases. Arizona State Troopers spokesman Tim Case said Thursday afternoon there have been 11 confirmed shootings in and around I-10 in less than two weeks, not including what he called ""numerous reports this morning of other vehicles with damage."" 

""This has not been confirmed to be part of this investigation,"" Case said of the new cases. 

Arizona's Department of Public Safety chief hasn't yet called this the case of a serial sniper, which could imply someone staking out a perch to selectively target people. Nor have authorities given any indication that they have a suspect in mind. 

But Col. Frank Milstead, the DPS director, has called tracking down the person responsible ""job one,"" a sentiment echoed Thursday by Arizona's governor. 

""This is our top priority in our administration,"" Gov. Doug Ducey said. ""I'd ask Arizonans to remain alert and aware. And we're going to find who's doing this and bring them to justice."" 

New round of shootings after break 

The first shootings were reported on August 29, when bullets hit three vehicles -- an SUV, an empty commercial tour bus and a passenger car -- as they traveled along I-10. 

There were two more shootings over the subsequent two days, then a break until the shootings apparently resumed on Sunday. Since then, there have been two box trucks, two pickups, a passenger car and a tractor trailer -- the latest incident Thursday morning -- struck. 

Milstead said then that some of the motorists didn't immediately realize their cars had been shot, thinking the loud noise they heard was an object on the highway that hit their vehicle. 

Bullets struck seven of the vehicles, according to the Case. The others were hit by projectiles that authorities are still trying to specify. 

The good news is that none of these shootings have been fatal. In fact, there's been only one related injury: A 13-year-old girl whose right ear was cut late last month when a bullet pierced the windshield of the SUV in which she was riding. 

But Milstead told CNN that luck may not hold out if this continues, which is why Gov. Doug Ducey referenced the shootings while tweeting that ""the safety of Arizonans is our number one priority."" 

""All of these acts are potentially lethal encounters,"" Milstead told CNN on Wednesday. ""When you're shooting into a moving vehicle with unwitting occupants, (it could be) lethal."" 

Official: Find shooter 'before someone is ... killed' 

Arthur Roderick, a former assistant director for the U.S. Marshals, noted the Phoenix shootings appear different from the October 2002 Washington-area sniper attacks that he helped investigate. 

For one, multiple weapons would be different from the single gun in the Beltway sniper case. And the latest shootings are more localized and not across several states. 

The more confined area could be a plus, with Roderick telling CNN, ""They're able to concentrate all their efforts in that one particular area."" 

That's what authorities are doing in Phoenix by utilizing state police, local departments' SWAT teams, FBI resources and highway surveillance cameras to keep an eye on the area. 

As to the motivation and who is responsible, Milstead said, ""We don't have a suspect in mind yet. 

""But we will find who this is,"" he added. ""And hopefully, we get to them before someone is seriously injured or killed.""",e446f8a4-fd5d-44f4-b15c-148023dae2a2,News,2015-09-11T02:27:32Z,KOCO 5,Phoenix I-10 shootings: Copycat possible,0.0,News

2834,"Kylie Jenner and Tyga are constantly all loved up and can’t keep their hands off each other but our source tells us that they do fight! Keep reading to find out how Drake is involved!  
Kylie Jenner  is totally in love with Tyga but she’s not very happy with his career! The 18-year-old, who is currently outselling her sisters with her app, is pushing Tyga to make more money and she thinks he should be more like her good friend, Drake ! Yikes! It turns out Tyga isn’t taking this too well and is deeply hurt that the love of his life would slam him like this. 
 
“Kylie loves Tyga dearly and she wants to support him and his every move,” our source tells us. “But she’s got a problem on her hands: and that’s the fact she’s light years ahead of him when it comes to money, career and fame. She wants him to have exactly what she has, if not more, and she’s been busting his chops, encouraging him to get in the studio and pump out some hits. She’s not berating him to do so, she’s simply encouraging him. She asked him once ‘don’t you want to be in the club and hearing the fans rap one of your songs like they do Drake?’ He got extremely offended And heated!” 
 
So how did Tyga handle all of this? “He said ‘bae how dare you compare me to that meathead Drake. That’s fu**ked up. you don’t know anything about rap. There’s much more skill involved than sitting around Snapchatting all day.’ Kylie didn’t take offense to it, all she said was ‘you’re right’ and ‘I was just trying to motivate you.'” But they still can’t keep their hands off each other and this is just a small blip in the road. “The guy even made her an appointment at the DMV so Kylie can have personalized plates on the Ferrari that reads ‘wifey,’ He wants her to get the name ‘Tyga’s Wife’ on her license plate. He’s into Kylie that much!” It doesn’t look like anything can stop these two! 
 Take Our Poll 
HollywoodLifers , do you think it’s fair for Kylie to put pressure on Tyga?

716,"Kobe Bryant’s last three seasons have ended in injuries. Now in his 20th and perhaps final season, the Lakers organization will be taking careful steps to preserve the Mamba’s health . 
 
Head coach Bryon Scott has faced criticism for playing Kobe extended minutes last season. In an interview with OC Register , Scott admitted he was wrong and will defer to Kobe about his minutes . 
 
Scott says he’ll sit down with Kobe to decide whether the Lakers star should play in back-to-backs. 
 
Q. What decisions are you facing with Kobe? 
 
  
 
A. I think the biggest decision is playing time, trying to make that as limited as possible and also back-to-back games. That’s something we have to talk about. Other than that, there really is no other decision to make. He wants to play, and he wants to go out the way he wants to go out — if this is indeed his final year. He and I have talked a number of times on the phone, we’ve talked about playing time, we’ve talked about back-to-back, we’re going to probably sit down as we get closer to training camp or as we get in training camp and even talk more about it. Because the one thing I want, if this is his last year, I want him to go out standing. I don’t want him to go out hurt. I want to make sure I do everything in my power to make sure we stick to the game plan, as far as his minutes and as far as back-to-back games. 
 
  
 
Q. What do you mean by as “limited as possible?” 
 
  
 
A. I didn’t mean play as limited as possible. Obviously we want to keep him as efficient as possible, but I know he knows his body better than anybody. When we start talking about those minutes, I want to listen to him more than anything. I’m not going to go by what I think he can play like I did last year, I want to really go by what he thinks he can play. Then I want to make sure we stick to that.

2242,"in BOLYWOOD / 					by / 					on September 28, 2015 at 8:47 am /  
Sriharikota (Andhra Pradesh) : India on Monday joined a select group of nations owning space observatory with the successful launch of ASTROSAT by its rocket, which also put into orbit six other foreign satellites. 
 
With the successful launch of ASTROSAT, India gained an entry into the select club of nations having its own space observatory after the US, Japan, Russia and Europe. 
 
Exactly at 10 a.m. the 44.4 metres tall weighing around 320 ton polar satellite launch vehicle's XL variant (PSLV-XL) blasted off the first launch pad at the rocket port here, around 80 km from Chennai. 
 
The PSLV-XL rocket with seven satellites cumulatively weighing 1,631 kg climbed up steadily gathering speed amidst the cheers of Indian space agency officials and the media team assembled here. 
 
The expendable rocket carried Rs.180 crore ASTROSAT, India's first dedicated multi-wavelength space observatory that will help in understanding the universe, and six other foreign satellites. 
 
While ASTROSAT with a five year life span weighed 1,513 kg, the six foreign satellites (four from the US and one each from Indonesia and Canada) together weighed 118 kg. 
 
Incidentally, this is the first time that an Indian rocket launched satellites from the US. 
 
According to an official of Antrix Corporation - the commercial arm of India Space Research Organisation (ISRO) - a deal has been signed to put into orbit nine American nano/micro satellites by the end of 2016. 
 
While four US satellites have been put into orbit on Monday, the remaining five would also piggy back on a bigger satellite later. 
 
At the mission control room, space scientists at Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) were glued to their computer screens watching the rocket escaping the earth's gravitational pull. 
 
Just over 22 minutes into the flight, the rocket slug ASTROSAT at an altitude of 650 km above the earth. 
 
Soon after, six other satellites were put into orbit and the whole mission ended in just over 25 minutes. 
 
For the third time a PSLV rocket has launched seven satellites in a single mission. In 2008, ISRO had launched 10 satellites in one go, including India's Cartosate-2A satellite. 
 
Immediately on the successfully ejection, scientists at the mission control centre were visibly relieved and started clapping happily. In the process India crossed the half century milestone when it its rocket injected the six foreign satellites successfully into their intended orbit. 
 
Till date, India has launched 45 foreign satellites for a fee. 
 
ISRO chairman A.S.Kiran Kumar described it as an ""eventful day"" and congratulated the entire ISRO team. 
 
P.Kunhi Krishnan, director, Satish Dhawan Space Centre, said: ""PSLV's success is continuous. Today it injected seven satellites in 
precise orbit."" 
 
However, it will not be right to call ASTROSAT as India's 'Hubble'. The Hubble owned and launched by the US in 1990 is 10 times heavier than the ASTROSAT and is said to cost $2.5 billion. 
 
While the Hubble space telescope is still working now, India's ASTROSAT's life span is five years. 
 
ASTROSAT, will observe the universe through optical, ultraviolet, low and high energy X-ray components of the electromagnetic spectrum, whereas most other scientific satellites are capable of observing through a narrow wavelength band. 
 
The five payloads/instruments of ASTROSAT are selected to facilitate deeper insight into the various astrophysical processes occurring in the various types of astronomical objects constituting our universe, ISRO said. 
 
The payloads are developed by different institutions-domestic and foreign- on their own or collaborating with ISRO. 
 
Of the five payloads, the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) is jointly developed by Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), Bengaluru and Inter University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) at Pune in collaboration with Canadian Space Agency and ISRO. 
 
This instrument can observe the sky in the visible near ultraviolet and far ultraviolet regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. 
 
The second payload Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter (LAXPC) is developed by Tata Institute for Fundamental Research TIFR), Mumbai and Raman Research Institute (RRI), Bengaluru. 
 
The third payload Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) is developed by TIFR in collaboration with the University of Leicester, UK and ISRO. 
 
The fourth payload Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager (CZTI) was developed by TIFR and IUCAA in collaboration with ISRO. 
 
And the fifth one Scanning Sky Monitor (SSM) was jointly developed by ISRO Satellite Centre at Bengaluru and IUCAA. 
 
The Indonesian 76 kg LAPAN-A2 is a micro-satellite from the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space, meant for providing maritime surveillance using automatic identification system (AIS), supporting Indonesian radio amateur communities for disaster mitigation and carrying out earth surveillance using video and digital camera. 
 
The 14 kg NLS-14 (Ev9) of Space Flight Laboratory, University of Toronto Institute for Advanced Studies, is also a maritime monitoring Canadian nano satellite using the next generation AIS. 
 
The remaining four LEMUR nano satellites from Spire Global Inc., San Francisco, US, are non-visual remote sensing satellites, focusing primarily on global maritime intelligence through vessel tracking via AIS and high-fidelity weather forecasting using GPS radio occultation technology, the ISRO said.

2910,"FIFA is understood to be looking into the details surrounding the collapsed transfer of David De Gea from Manchester Untied to Real Madrid, according to the Daily Mail. 
 
The longest running transfer saga of the summer seems to have had a bizarre ending last night, as the Spanish goalkeeper’s anticipated move to the Bernebau stalled in the final moments of the Spanish transfer window despite all parties seemingly giving their approval to the deal. 
 
It looked like the 24-year-old was finally about to get his wish when Real Madrid and Manchester United agreed a cash + player deal for David De Gea with current Los Blancos keeper Keylor Navas heading to Old Trafford in exchange. 
 
The deal dragged on into the last hours of the transfer window and when the Spanish deadline closed at 11pm last night, local media in Spain reported that United failed to get the paperwork in on time to approve the deal. 
 
Both parties have since blamed each other for the collapse of the transfer and the Spanish giants have now lodged an appeal with FIFA in an attempt to try and revive the deal for David De Gea. 
 
We will be watching this developing story closely for further details

1931,"NEW YORK, Sept. 30, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Wolf Popper LLP is investigating claims on behalf of investors in Rentrak Corporation (""Rentrak"") (NASDAQ: RENT), concerning the proposed acquisition of Rentrak by comScore, Inc. (NASDAQ: SCOR). Rentrak shareholders seeking more information about this acquisition can contact Carl L. Stine at (212) 759-4600 or cstine@wolfpopper.com.

There's nothing funny about Floyd Mayweather's reading ability, and it is stupid and cynical to think otherwise. Moreover, the situation should induce an uncomfortable amount of pity and shame from the world, rather than laughter. Mayweather is reprehensible, that much can't be argued, and no amount of boxing genius can change the corruptness of the human spirit or the damage that he has done to the women he has encountered. But deriding the man for his struggles with reading is not only elitist, with roots in racism, it's just downright crass. 

A recent war of words with Destroyer of Worlds Ronda Rousey went something like this: Dana White spent a few months last year proclaiming that Rousey could beat Mayweather in an MMA fight. When asked about this, Mayweather claimed to not know who Rousey was and even referred to her as ""he."" Rousey shot back by bringing up Mayweather's history of domestic violence, before taking another verbal jab at the boxing champion at the 2015 ESPYs. Mayweather responded with the ""I'm richer than you"" route and then attempted to dismiss the situation. 

Rousey countered his insult (that she needed to make $300 million before speaking to him) with: ""I actually did the math and, given the numbers of my last fight, I'm actually the highest-paid UFC fighter, and I'm a woman. I think I actually make two to three times more than he does per second ... so when he learns to read and write, he can text me."" 

The entire exchange is childish. It's embarrassing for both parties and their respective fans. It's entirely forgettable except for the strain at the end of Rousey's last retort. That snarky comment belittling him for his reading ability is insidious. Of course the public digested it and laughed with her, just as they had laughed when 50 Cent (a former friend of Mayweather's) introduced the embarrassing reality to Instagram some time ago. In one post, he even bet that if Mayweather could read one page out of a Harry Potter book, he would donate a specified cash amount to charity. 

This led the leaking of an audio file of Mayweather struggling to read a drop for a New York radio show. In it, Mayweather could be heard struggling beyond the initial, ""This is Floyd Mayweather."" He tried multiple times and towards the end, it felt repulsive for the hosts to push for a completion, knowing that he was being recorded. After it was revealed, the jokes poured in from all angles. Mayweather, untouchable in the square circle, was now utterly human in the most public way possible. His defense had been breached and behind it was a fallible being who responded that he all needed to be able to read was his checks. 

The problem here is that literacy still is and has historically been a weapon of the elite. Consider that 18 percent of Michigan, Mayweather's home state, is functionally illiterate. And that 21 percent of citizens in Grand Rapids, where he was born, are as well 

. 

Acknowledge that he dropped out of high school and grew up poor, and that poverty and illiteracy are heavily linked. That Mayweather was once a black child, and that black children are more than three times as likely to live in extreme poverty than white children in America. That these black children enter school already behind and usually into lower quality institutions. 

The problem here is that literacy still is and has historically been a weapon of the elite. 

Factor in that poor black children are almost three times more likely to be held back in school than their white counterparts. That while they are only 17 percent of the public school population, they represent 35.6 percent of students who experienced corporal punishment, 37.4 percent of all students suspended and 37.9 percent of all students expelled. That around 12th grade, out of the remaining children who have not dropped out or been expelled, 84 percent of them can't read at grade level. 

B e conscious of the fact that Mayweather took special education classes for reading in school. That black children are twice as likely as white children to be placed in a class for students with intellectual disability. 

You have to know that we are a society in which literacy and intelligence are inseparable and yet, by design, the intermingling demographic of poor and black receive the short end of the stick. Then the labels and stereotypes feed the beast and the world acts as if no one knows why they suffer. 

It's not by chance that the poorest of us are forced to live in the worst neighborhoods and given the worst education possible. And it's neither bad luck nor divine retribution for his atrocious nature that Mayweather struggles to read. He is just the most famous face of the many millions who are burdened with that indignity. 

The cowardly rationalization will be to say that Mayweather is ridiculously rich and still hasn't changed his situation. But that assumes that people only look down on…",d94da874-42c0-4daf-805d-b5e8eca6f036,News,2015-09-04T19:25:26Z,MyInforms,It's cruel to laugh at Floyd Mayweather's reading problems,0.0,News

3424,"  Facts ignored – The invention of the village of Susiya editor Wednesday 2 September 2015	By Ari Briggs.. The fact is that the area occupied by the squatters has only served as grazing land. On July 16 (2015) the daily press briefing of the US State Department astonished legal circles in Israel. In response to the second question, preceded only by an inquiry on the Iran agreement from which Israel is still reeling, State Department spokesperson John Kirby with a prepared statement pressured Israel not to enforce demolition orders against an illegal Arab encampment adjacent to the Jewish community of Susiya. The State Department took this stand despite the fact that these demolition orders had been confirmed by Israel’s High Court in May 2015 after decades of appeals. The Israelis were astonished for two reasons. One, the State Department was apparently misinformed about basic facts of the case. Two, the statement appears to be an arrogant attempt to undermine the Israeli legal system, including its universally respected High Court. The High Court found that these assertions were demonstrably false, based on comprehensive objective historical and geographical accounts. Historical aerial photography, detailed mandatory maps, travelogues from the 18th and 19th centuries, and the population registry all established that their assertions were a fabrication. Fact: no such village ever existed. The High Court has ruled repeatedly against these false assertions (HC 7530/01, 430/12, 1556/12, 1420/14). See the latest opinion pieces on our Opinion & Blogs Facebook page However, the Nawajah family’s “struggle” has become a cause célèbre of the cadre of foreigners and foreign-funded NGOs intent on harming Israel and its standing worldwide through untruths, misrepresentations and outright lies. Second, apparently the State Department failed to realize that the High Court established that the Nawajah family members have permanent homes in Yata, a city in Area A, under full Palestinian Authority rule (HCJ 430/12 and HCJ 1556/12). Moreover, Regavim’s research has established that like other PA residents from Areas A & B, the Nawajah family are being encouraged by the PA in accordance with the Fayyad Plan (2009) and assisted by the EU (EU report “Area C and Palestinian State Building”– 2011) to illegally establish facts on the ground in Area C (under full Israeli authority, as per Oslo Accords). Regavim has documented at least 20 illegal structures in the encampment, funded directly by the EU and proudly bearing the EU flag. The encampment is strategically placed between the Jewish community of Susiya and the Susiya archaeological site. Their agenda is clearly intended to obliterate the fact that an ancient Jewish community, including a magnificent ancient synagogue, thrived in this area before Islam even existed. The fact is that the area occupied by the squatters has only served as grazing land. In 1982 Plia Albeck, the state’s land expert, documented some private land in the area and confirmed it as agricultural land only. Anthropologist Yaacov Havakook researched the area the 1980s when he lived there for several years. As an expert witness he stated: “The Arabs never lived permanently in these caves… the caves have been used only as temporary dwellings by shepherds for two weeks to a month a year during the grazing season.” Two days prior to the State Department statement, B’tselem, an NGO well-funded by the EU and foreign governments including France, the UK and Germany as well as by the New Israel Fund, published a press release saying that pressure from Regavim is forcing the government’s hand and quoting the illegal encampment’s counsel, saying “that this kind of thinly veiled threat to demolish homes in Susiya before the planned court hearing is an unacceptable form of coercion”. Reading this quote one would conclude that the hearing on August 3rd is intended to adjudicate the legality of the demolition orders. This is a deliberate attempt to mislead, and unfortunately, the US State Department was again apparently misled. In fact, the legality of the demolition orders has been confirmed by the High Court many times over the protracted litigation, and the High Court denied a request for an injunction against the orders despite the pending hearing: “Taking the law into one’s own hands even after filing this petition precludes granting an interim order.” (HCJ 1420/14) The State department also stated, “We urge Israeli authorities to work with the residents of the village to finalize a plan for the village that addresses the residents’ humanitarian needs.” The State department purposefully ignored the true state of affairs or was woefully ill informed in this regard as well. In fact, even though they have homes in Yatta, the Civil Administration had agreed to establish a new village in Area C, a mere 2 miles from their current illegal encampment, more than providing for their “humanitarian needs”. It is crucial that the facts be told and the law upheld despite the extreme pressure being applied by the EU and US State Department.The Israeli government dare not cede the rule of law in this blatant and misguided attempt to usurp the authority and power of our courts and legal system.  If the government appears powerless in the face of pressure from such outside forces and continues to sacrifice the country’s interests, Israel will, indeed, invite additional pressure, while weakening its own resolve to pursue justice. Our legal system is internationally recognized as robust, strong and just. Ignoring the history and facts of this particular case would be particularly egregious, as it would blatantly violate a basic legal principle: Ex injuria jus non oritur, legal rights cannot derive from an illegal act, or in this case, decades of demonstrably illegal acts. Regavim is proud to be considered the counter pressure pushing the government to uphold the rule of law and the equal application of that law. The author is a director of Regavim, a research based legal advocacy organization, dedicated to ensuring responsible, legal and accountable use of Israel’s national land.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Thursday that August, this past summer and the first eight months of 2015 all smashed global records for heat.

Since 2000, Earth has broken monthly heat records 30 times and seasonal heat records 11 times. Scientists blame a combination of human-caused climate change and natural El Nino.

1311,"MUMBAI: Union Minister for Minority Affairs Najma Heptulla has said that her ministry is working to achieve PM Modi’s vision of making India the skill capital of the world and making it a reality amongst the minorities. 
The first Education Minister of India, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad always considered education as the basis of human development and thus he wanted each and every citizen of India to get educated, she said. 
The minister was speaking at the closing ceremony of skill development training programme here last evening, by Maulana Azad National Academy For Skills (MANAS), organized for awarding certificates to the students and disburse loan to the candidates preferring self employment. 
Azad always emphasised on creating a uniform education system so that the intellectual class of the country will have a balanced thought and concern, she added. 
The PM today is concentrating more on skilling India according to modern requirements so that everybody is benefited, she said. 
Heptulla said Mumbai is the financial capital of the country and there is a trend of entrepreneurship and running one’s own business here. 
“Through MANAS, I would like to experience and prove that this trend of the city, can not only be implemented for the empowerment of Minorities, especially for women but will also open a new chapter in the history for the welfare of minorities in India. I am very happy to share with you that our efforts in Mumbai regarding empowering minorities have validated the results,” she said. 
This initiative of MANAS will give strength to PM’s Make in India effort. Based on the positive results of the skill development efforts in suburbs like Bhandup, Mumbra, Sakinaka, Kurla and Meera Road, minorities in other areas of Maharashtra such as Bhivandi, Nagpur, and Baramati, will be trained according to the local requirements of the region, she said. 
While reminding people about the PM’s vision of empowering minorities and that he would like to see all Muslim youth in India hold Quran in one hand and computer in the other, she said that this will empower them and enable them in getting education as well as employment. 
Skill development centre has been created in madarsas for the benefit of minorities and this is a positive step towards involving minorities into the PM’s skill India mission towards realising Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas agenda. 
Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who was also present assured the minorities that the government of Maharashtra will give full support and cooperation to the works done towards their welfare. (AGENCIES)

The Bachelorette, Ten, 7.30pm 

Fourteen blokes – several of whom we suspect are wearing a suit for the first time in their lives – tonight introduce themselves to the fascinating Sam Frost. She’s a lady who’s been battered by life and reality TV shows and yet here she is fronting up for another bout. Of course, this time it’s she who’ll be wielding the roses (and forcing her suitors to accompany her on a series of bizarre dates) and the dynamics of that promise to make this intriguing. Tonight is the traditional getting-to-know-you exercise.

The Block, Nine, 7.30pm 

We know reality TV is all about casting, all about the characters, but few series develop/manipulate their characters with quite the same expertise or finesse as The Block. To its credit, it’s less interested in creating heroes and villains than in showing us the strengths and frailties of everyone involved. Tonight the contestants face their first challenge, during which (a) Scotty proves why he’s not a judge on this show, and (b) various rivalries are played out face to face. There are some splendidly broad moments (including some death stares worthy of Real Housewives). But there is also some delicately handled progression. In one scene, one character displays herself in a genuinely unattractive light. But by the end of the episode we’re suddenly realising just how fragile she actually is, and how close to cracking. It’s a masterly piece of editing.

Clothes to Die For, ABC2, 9.20pm 

In style, this British documentary is reminiscent of the many films made in the wake of 9/11 and the London bombings: beautifully-shot to-camera pieces (interspersed with archival footage) that gradually change in mood from the innocent and matter-of-fact to the utterly heartbreaking. And that only seems appropriate, because while the collapse of the clothing factory in Bangladesh’s Rana Plaza that killed almost 1200 people and injured thousands more was not politically motivated, its cultural, social and personal ramifications are very much the same. This thoughtful, unsensational piece lets the facts, and the people affected, tell the story in a way that’s both compelling and thought-provoking. The overarching message is corporate greed inevitably has a profound human cost.

Lost in Transmission, A&E, 8.30pm

Southern hipster and Top Gear USA presenter Rutledge Wood has set up a business that helps Americans get old and unusual cars back on the road. The problem is that he usually underquotes and so has to come up with wacky money-making schemes to get the cash he needs to finish the job. Tonight, for instance, he agrees to restore a 1972 Land Cruiser that hasn’t run in 20 years, only to find that it’s a bigger job than he thought. His solution? Spend $5000 on a little old Volkswagen Jetta and a conversion kit that will turn it into a two-door ute. Such a vehicle, he imagines, should sell immediately for $10,000. It’s all fairly entertaining and even a little inspiring.

Wonderland (2003), SBS2, 10.20pm 

In a 1995 Details magazine profile of Val Kilmer, Bret Easton Ellis wrote, “in movies he has the open-faced, slightly flawed, amiable American beauty that Bruce Weber taps into: a thick-lipped insolence ... a masculinity so effortless it borders on the perverse.” Kilmer was the native Californian who went to Juilliard to study acting and then returned to Hollywood, where for many years he was spoken of as a major star in the making. But the starring roles (The Doors, Batman Forever, The Saint) didn’t match up to the compelling supporting turns (Tombstone, Heat), and early in this century he changed tack, jumping into independent productions such as James Cox’s crime drama about 1981 revenge murders of a Los Angeles crew who had robbed a drug dealer. The central figure was 1970s porn star John Holmes, whose cocaine addiction resulted in multiple bloody betrayals, and Kilmer capably catches the character’s desperation even as the film descends into low-life pungency that never finds a purpose. The same events inspired the firecracker-punctuated drug sting in Boogie Nights, but Cox can’t match a sweating, discombobulated supporting cast, including that master of malice Dylan McDermott, to such coolly inspired filmmaking, and Kilmer’s opportunity is once more lost.

Blood Simple (1984), stan.com.au Critics were divided when Joel and Ethan Coen announced themselves as twentysomething filmmakers more than three decades ago with this Texan-set thriller – “a crude, ghoulish comedy on thriller themes,” wrote Pauline Kael in TheNew Yorker. But looking at the movie now, a neo-noir confection of desire and murder assembled from the stories of James M. Cain and Dashiell Hammett, it’s obvious how self-contained and identifiable the siblings already were. “I know where you can get those framed,” aprivate eye named Visser (M. Emmet Walsh) tells a bar owner, Marty (Dan Hedaya), when he presents him with photos of his wife, Abby (Frances McDormand) in bed with his bartender, Ray (John Getz), and from that staring point nocturnal acts of cruelty take shape not through nefarious schemes but crude assumptions and mistaken identity. These lives are like bitter clockwork designs no one can see, but the difference from latter Coen brothers works is the lack of ironic distance – there’s a rage in Hedaya’s performance that isn’t undercut by the bloody B-movie violence. At one point the camera tracks down the bar top, hopping over the head of a passed-out patron without pause, making for a witty, self-referential arrival.

3685,"BIRMINGHAM (UNITED KINGDOM) - South Africa skipper Jean de Villiers expected to be dropped after the Springboks sensational defeat by Japan in last weekend's World Cup pool game, he admitted Friday. 
 
South Africa's center and captain Jean de Villiers delivers a press conference at Villa Park stadium in Birmingham, on September 25, 2015, during the Rugby Union World Cup 

But the veteran centre, who will lead South Africa into their crunch Pool B match against Samoa on Saturday, said he had a duty to repair the divisions in South Africa caused by the greatest upset in Rugby World Cup history. 

Asked whether he had expected coach Heyneke Meyer to drop him after last Saturday's defeat, de Villiers said: ""Yes I did. 

""After the backing that the coach has given me, I have to perform and show that I deserve that opportunity. 

""I'm very aware of the criticism he has undergone for selecting me."" 

There have been widespread calls in South Africa for Meyer and 34-year-old de Villiers to pay for the Japan defeat with their jobs. 

Even if South Africa win the Pool B match on Saturday, the coach and captain know they are not safe. 

""We all know how important this game is for our country,"" de Villiers said. 

""We are a very proud nation. What saddens me is to see how a loss like this can break the country apart. That's a responsibility that we (have) to rectify."" 

De Villiers said ""rugby is a game, but in South Africa it has become so much more than just a game and we carry that responsibility with us every single time we enter the field. We disappointed a lot of people last week. 

""We need to stand up. We put ourselves in this position and we need to get ourselves out of this position."" 

De Villiers, who has a World Cup curse having missed the 2003 edition through injury and then missed out on the 2007 final triumph having been injured in the opening pool game, endured  said it has been a difficult week.

3726,"When did giving states a blank check for federal dollars become a principle of conservative Democrats and Republicans?  It's a question with no clear answers as the bills reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) passed the House and Senate before the summer recess with weak to no accountability for improved student outcomes.  Conservatives have long worn the badge of fiscal responsibility, but their rhetoric falls short when it comes to education. 

Congress is back in session and one of the first orders of business is the reauthorization of ESEA.  Up for debate will be how to bring two conflicting visions for education into one bill that can pass congressional muster and be signed into law.  All eyes will be on the Congress and the White House to ensure that the necessary changes are made to the existing proposals.  The most important change needed is to hold states accountable to measurably improve education outcomes and require them to take action when students are not achieving. 

The House narrowly passed H.R. 5 without Democratic support. This bill known as the ""Student Success Act"" goes too far to the extreme.  States have the discretion to use taxpayer dollars however they like in whatever schools they identify for intervention based on their own accountability systems. Sounds great for the state, but not for the tax payer.  It strips away any oversight for how federal funds are used when schools and their students are not succeeding.  Accountability is a fundamentally conservative value - since when are fiscal conservatives comfortable with giving money away with no expectation of anything in return? 

The Senate bill, S. 1177, known as the ""Every Child Achieves Act,"" (ECAA) is marginally better.  It requires the same level of transparency as current law that allows educators, parents and stakeholders to know how students are doing.  The bill also requires states to place a greater emphasis on academic indicators of success to identify schools in need of improvement.  But like the House bill, ECAA lacks explicit language requiring states to act once the state has identified that a school and its students are failing to achieve.  This is unacceptable - transparency without action is simply not enough. 

ESEA was enacted 50 years ago to ensure that students from low income and underrepresented communities had an equal shot at a quality education.  And tax payer dollars would be the means to level the playing field.  In today's parlance, that means not just providing students with access to opportunity, but assuming the responsibility to intervene and act when students are failing to meet academic benchmarks of success.  Fifty years ago a lack of accountability saw taxpayer dollars building swimming pools, installing toilets and providing a homemaking program for girls in an all-black school.  This was not the ""equality"" envisioned by the framers of the law; but the blank check being pushed by conservatives in the name of ""local flexibility"" may very well lead us back there. 

Last year, approximately $14 billion dollars of Title I funds were provided to schools to improve achievement and promote success among our most vulnerable students. In exchange for receiving billions of dollars in federal funds, states should agree to put in place protections to make sure these funds are being used to support students and improve achievement.  When states aren't required to institute critical safeguards - such as the requirement to act when students are not succeeding - are they being held accountable to the taxpayer who expects certain outcomes?  I don't believe they are and we deserve far better from our elected officials. 

Conservative Republicans and Democrats will need to take a hard look in the mirror.  If they accept ESEA legislation without meaningful accountability, it will hurt our most vulnerable populations.  Groups like Latinos, African-Americans and students with disabilities will be disproportionately affected.  Civil rights and educational organizations, members of both parties, and independents, all agreed that we must include language that holds our states accountable for the achievement of all of our students.  To do anything less is a gross misuse of our tax dollars in education.

258,"The Dom Post reports : 
 
A Wellington woman tried to explain to a brutal rapist that she could be pregnant with her first child and begged him not to hurt her. 
 
It did not matter to Bailey Meredith, 17, who violated her over and over during an attack on the Hutt River riverbank on June 11 before beating her unconscious. 
 
She had been out walking when he had grabbed her from behind, ordering her to her knees before saying he intended to rape her. 
 
The victim went on to explain about IVF which she and her husband had been going through but it made no difference.  They were to find out if she was pregnant that weekend instead she was being treated for her injuries and tested for sexually transmitted diseases. 
 
Meredith had pleaded guilty to rape, four charges of unlawful sexual connection, abduction with intent to rape, wounding with intent to injure and threatening to kill.  He has been jailed for eight years. 
 
That seems light to me. In 2010 I blogged the Court of Appeal guidelines being : 
  Rape Band 1 (6 to 8 yrs) – offending at the lower end of the spectrum where there are no aggravating factors, no serious violence, no abduction, the victim is not very young or very old.  Rape Band 2 (7 to 13 yrs) – involves moderate violence, pre-meditation, a rape involving more than one offender, or an especially vulnerable victim  Rape Band 3 (12 to 18 yrs) – offending with serious additional violence, wit multiple (three or more) aggravating factors. For particularly cruel, callous or violent rapes.  Rape Band 4 (16 to 20 yrs) – for multiple offending over considerable periods of time, gang or pack rape.   
There was obvious serious violence that left her unconscious.  It would seem to me the case would be Rape Band 2 or 3, not Rape Band 1. 
 
Officer in charge of the investigation, Detective Sergeant Nick Pritchard, said it was one of the worst cases he had investigated. 
 
“This was a sexual attack that involved extreme violence. It was one of the most violent sexual attacks I’ve seen in my career,” he said. 
 
So eight years seems rather light. He did plead guilty which gets 10% to 33% knocked off.  But in theory he could be out of jail in under three years.

New Delhi: Seventh Pay Commission is ready with its recommendations on revising emoluments for nearly 50 lakh central government employees and 55 lakh pensioners, and will soon submit report to the Finance Ministry.
Earlier in August, the government had extended Commission’s term by another four months till December 31 to give recommendations.
“The Commission is ready with recommendations and the report will be submitted soon,” according to sources.
The Commission, whose recommendations may also have a bearing on the salaries of the state government staff, was given more time by the Union Cabinet just a day before its original 18-month term was coming to an end.
Headed by Justice A K Mathur, the Commission was appointed in February 2014 and its recommendations are scheduled to take effect from January 1, 2016.
The government constitutes the Pay Commission almost every 10 years to revise the pay scale of its employees and often states also implement the panel’s recommendations after some modifications.
As part of the exercise, the Commission holds discussions with various stakeholders, including organisations, federations, groups representing civil employees as well as defence services.
Meena Agarwal is the secretary of the Commission. Other members are Vivek Rae, a retired IAS officer of 1978 batch and Rathin Roy, an economist.
The Sixth Pay Commission was implemented with effect from January 1, 2006, the fifth from January 1, 1996 and the fourth from January 1, 1986.

2081,"Findings from a head-to-head trial comparing Novo Nordisk’s Victoza (liraglutide) and lixisenatide, both in combination with metformin, have demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in blood sugar for liraglutide compared to lixisenatide in adults with type 2 diabetes.

In the LIRA-LIXI trial, people in the liraglutide arm achieved a significantly greater reduction in HbA1c versus lixisenatide at 26 weeks, meeting the trial’s primary endpoint. In addition, more people treated with liraglutide achieved HbA1c targets of 7% and ≤6.5% compared with lixisenatide. A reduction in HbA1c can provide both a huge personal benefit and a significant cost saving through the reduction of complications. A one percentage point drop in HbA1c can lead to a 37% reduction in microvascular complications, a 14% reduction in myocardial infarctions and a 21% reduction in overall diabetes-related mortality.

Professor Sudhesh Kumar from the Warwickshire Institute for the Study of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire, commented, “Many people living with type 2 diabetes remain poorly controlled, which can lead to severe complications. These complications are extremely prevalent and can account for up to 80% of the cost of diabetes to the NHS. Therefore, it is crucial that these patients gain control of their blood glucose levels early in treatment. The significant difference in blood glucose control between liraglutide and lixisenatide reinforces the value of liraglutide as an effective treatment option for those with type 2 diabetes.”

Liraglutide also demonstrated significantly greater reductions in fasting blood sugar and mean self-measured blood sugar compared with lixisenatide. Lixisenatide, however, had smaller changes in blood sugar after eating a meal following injection compared to liraglutide.

1002,"Two weeks into a three-week break, New Zealand golfer Lydia Ko is refreshed and ready to tackle the five-tournament Asian swing of the LPGA Tour. 

The world No.2, who sits fractionally behind top-ranked South Korean Inbee Park, has been enjoying some hard-earned time off after winning her first major title at the Evian Championship earlier this month. 

The 18-year-old returned to her Orlando, Florida, base for a little down time but told lpga.com she wasn't expecting to take too much of a break. 

""I don't really like to do a lot of physical things outside the golf course, and just lying in bed watching movies is good enough for me,"" she said. 

""Now I just kind of need to go back to square one, do my basic practices and work my way towards the Asia Swing."" 

Ko fashioned back-to-back wins in her last two starts, taking out the Canadian Open in August before wrapping the Evian Championship a month later. 

And although she's enjoying a break from the Tour, Ko says she's also aware that the first tournament of the Asia Swing begins in Kuala Lumpur on October 8. 

""I'm pretty sure it's going to be a great couple weeks in Asia. I kind of have to think of this in the back of my mind, enjoy it, but also prepare for what's coming up next."" 

It's been seven months since Park seized the world No.1 ranking off Ko, but the pair are now the closest they've been since February. 

Park sits on 12.94 ranking points to Ko's 12.82, well clear of their nearest rival, American Stacy Lewis. 

Ko and Park are almost neck and neck in every department with seven tournaments remaining in 2015 - not just the world rankings but also prize money earnings this year, along with LPGA's lucrative points race. 

The season concludes in late November at the Tour Championship in Florida, which Ko won last year to see off Park for money, points and top dog status.

2008,"Russia: Kremlin energy tsar says OPEC may have to ditch its low-price policy within months. But Russia needs to cut output quietly too







Gazprom's revenues are likely to drop by almost a third to $106bn this year Photo: Bloomberg News












By Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, Cernobbio, Italy
The Telegraph
.



The OPEC oil cartel cannot withstand the pain of low crude prices indefinitely and may be forced to abandon its pugnacious bid for market share within months, Russia's chief energy official has predicted.




Arkady Dvorkovich, the deputy prime minister, said OPEC producers are suffering the ricochet effects of their attempt to flush out rivals by flooding the world with excess output.




""I don't think they really want to live with low oil prices for a long time. At some point it is likely that are going to have to change policy. They can last a few months, to a couple of years,"" he told The Telegraph.




Saudi Arabia took a fateful decision last November to crank up production to record levels despite a glut of 1-2m barrels a day (b\d) accumulating in global markets, hoping to halt the advance of US shale and kill off high-cost projects in the Arctic and deep off-shore waters.

Riyadh has made it clear that it will not cut output to shore up prices unless non-OPEC producers share of the burden. This essentially means Russia, the world's biggest producer.

Mr Dvorkovich, the head of Russia's economic and energy strategy, said his country was in constant talks with OPEC in order to bring about a ""more rational policy"" but was coy on whether the Kremlin would break the impasse and strike a deal with the Saudis.

""Our consultations do not imply directly that we are going to see any coordinated action. Perhaps 'yes', perhaps 'no', most likely 'no',"" he said, speaking at the Ambrosetti forum of world policy-makers on Lake Como. ""We are sending signals to each other.""

Russia insists that it cannot switch off output as easily as the Saudis, given the harsh weather in the Siberian fields, a claim dismissed by OPEC as a negotiating ploy.

Nor can the Kremlin order Russian drillers to slash production without under-cutting its insistence that these oil groups are genuine companies, answerable to their shareholders. Yet there are subtle ways of achieving the same outcome.

The Kremlin, Moscow  Photo: CORBIS

The head of Russia's oil giant Rosneft, Igor Sechin, has been the right-hand man of president Vladimir Putin for more than twenty years. The company is 70pc state-owned. ""If Putin wants to cut, of course he can do it. Everybody knows that, "" said one OPEC veteran.

Mr Dvorkovich hinted that output cuts could be on the way. ""We are not going to cut supply artificially. Oil companies will act on their own. They will look at market forces and decide whether to invest more or less,"" he said.

""If prices stay low it is in the nature of oil companies to stabilise production, or even to cut production. The government will not decide on the behalf of oil companies what to do,"" he said.

Adnan Shihab-Eldin, the former secretary-general of OPEC, said the oil cartel is in ""bad shape"" and may have to rethink its current strategy. ""Can OPEC really afford to the policy started in November of letting the market determine prices,"" said at the Ambrosetti forum.

Mr Shihab-Eldin said US shale drillers have proved remarkably resilient, slashing costs from $70 a barrel to nearer $50 through new technology and a switch to higher-yielding ""sweet spots"". The rig-count has halved but production has hardly fallen.



He said OPEC will make a hard-headed decision over how best to extract maximum revenue, ditching its current policy if it does not pay. ""Keeping market share at any price is not an ideology for OPEC,"" he said.

Russia is in deep crisis. The economy has contracted by 4.6pc over the last year. The rouble has halved against the dollar since mid-2014, falling pari passu with the price of Brent crude. While this provides a shock-absorber of sorts, it makes life much harder for Russian firms struggling to repay $12-15bn a quarter in external dollar debt.

These companies are largely shut out of global capital markets by Western sanctions, forcing them to rely heavily on the Russian state for dollar liquidity. Yet the central bank is trying to conserve its foreign reserves. The treasury itself failed to sell all its bonds at an auction last month.



Russia's strategic embrace with China has so far failed to produce much beyond warm words. A $400bn gas deal signed in May 2014 has run into trouble as the Chinese haggle hard over prices and stall on $55bn of financing for the construction projects. Hopes for a second pipeline to China from West Siberia have come to little.

An informal 'super-OPEC' with Russia would control roughly 45pc of the global oil market, roughly equal to OPEC's glory days in the 1970s. Industry experts say the Saudis might consider a deal if Russia offered a gentleman's agreement to trim its 10.7m b\d output by 500,000.

Eventually, this may happen by default. The main Russian wells in Western Siberia are Soviet vintage and depleting at a rate of 8-11pc a year. Sanctions have paralyzed new investments in the Arctic and the Bazhenov shale basin.

Saudi Arabia is also in some trouble, and lacks Russia's industrial depth and strategic strengths. Riyadh's foreign reserves have fallen to $661bn from $737bn over the last eleven months.

The Saudis still have an ample cushion but are running a budget deficit of 20pc of GDP to cover their social welfare spending and military expansion. They must either drain reserves at a pace of $12bn a month, or issue debt.



One foreign policy veteran said it is mystifying what the Saudis really intend to do under the new regime of King Salman. ""They have gone from being the most predictable of countries, to the most unpredictable,"" he said.

The Russians and the Saudis have powerful reasons to co-operate on energy policies. Until now they have been on opposing sides in Syria, poisoning everything. This may be changing. King Salman has been invited to visit Moscow as the thaw in relations deepens.

Mr Putin is building up Russia's troop presence in Syria but he has also sent shockwaves through Damascus by backing some form of ""power-sharing"" in the country, a sign that Bashar al-Assad's days may be numbered.

The contours of a realpolitik entente between Saudi Arabia and Russia are emerging, with major implications for the global oil markets and the world economy.

Mr Dvorkovich said the Kremlin would stand behind its long-standing ally for now. ""There are many people who still support Assad, We're not going to put anyone aside, except the terrorists,"" he said.

1561,"CARTHAGE — For the second time this season, the Neosho Wildcats battled a state-ranked Central Ozark Conference Large opponent down to the final play. The Wildcats fell behind 14-0 to Class 5’s No. 9 Carthage late in the first quarter and trailed 20-6 at halftime Friday night at K.E. Baker Stadium. However, the Wildcat defense came through with consecutive drive-ending stops on fourth down and Devin Hames’ 4-yard touchdown run with 2 minutes, 10 seconds remaining in the game made it 20-19 Carthage. Neosho head coach Dustin Baldwin and the Wildcats decided to go for the two-point conversion and the lead, showing confidence in their offense and their defense. Jake Kleindl and Zach Thornton stopped a scrambling Coleman Scott short on the conversion after a play-action pass broke down and dodged a bullet on the ensuing onside kick, the ball trickling out of bounds before Neosho could gain possession. Neosho’s D stuffed Carthage’s Kendall Young on fourth-and-2 at the Neosho 42 and the Wildcats took over possession with only 7 ticks left. On first down, Scott missed Hames on a short pass. On second, Scott connected with Payton Klier over the middle. Klier gained 19 yards, tackled at the Carthage 39 as time expired for a 20-19 Carthage victory on its homecoming. Neosho’s two losses this season have come by a total of four points. Defensive stands fuel Wildcats In the second half, the Wildcats were very much a bend and don’t break defense. Taking first possession, the Tigers worked two first downs on third-down plays, a 9-yard pass and catch with quarterback Keith Guest and running back Young and a 33-yard pass from Guest to fellow junior Logan Kabance, a play that burned Neosho on three different occasions for nearly 100 yards and three first downs. Guest’s 12-yard run down to the Neosho 11 gave the Tigers a first down. After Carthage’s signal-caller ran for four yards on first down, Neosho stiffened, dropping Trey Collins for a two-yard loss and forcing an incomplete pass on second and third downs, respectively. With a fourth-and-8 at the Neosho 9, Carthage went for it and Guest’s pass to Tyler Ralston took the senior wide receiver out-of-bounds. On the subsequent Neosho possession, the Wildcats moved the ball near Carthage territory behind a pair of first-down runs by Hames and Scott, Scott’s 11-yard run a highlight of the drive. The Tigers were whistled for a 15-yard personal foul penalty, giving Neosho first-and-10 at the Carthage 37. The Wildcats dialed up a little trickeration, as backup quarterback Gavin Kelley hit Ethan Siler for a 37-yard TD pass on a halfback pass. Brett Williams’ extra point made it 20-13 Carthage with 2:30 left in the third. Page 2 of 4 - We had a brand new game. Dillon Lancaster’s 21-yard kickoff return gave Carthage possession at its own 30 with 2:21 remaining in the third. Once again, Carthage pieced together a drive into Neosho territory and the Tigers had an apparent first down on fourth-and-1 at the Neosho 21 taken away by a holding penalty. With a fourth-and-13 at the Neosho 33, Guest overshot Ralston down the middle and the Tigers had their second 10-plus play drive stall out with no points. Taking over at their own 33 with 9:04 left on the clock, the Wildcats answered with their own meticulous drive lasting 6:54 and taking 17 plays before Hames’ 4-yard TD run. Hames leaped into the end zone from about the Carthage 2. Key plays on the drive included a Jarvis Funk 10-yard reception that gained 10 yards back after an illegal block. Then, on the next play, rather than a fourth-and-long, Neosho faced a fourth-and-1 and Scott earned it with a 2-yard keeper. Klier made a 13-yard catch, followed by a Hames 10-yard run and the Wildcats earned first-and-goal after Scott rushed for six yards on a fourth-and-2. Turnovers, not penalties Two Neosho turnovers proved costly in the first half. On the first play of the game, Neosho worked a shuffle pass to Klier for a 33-yard gain down to the Carthage 32. Six plays later, with a second-and-5 at the Carthage 10 after a Funk 10-yard reception and a Hames 5-yard run, Klier fumbled the ball and Carthage recovered it at the 12. Four first downs and one Kabance 37-yard reception down to the Neosho 1 later, Carthage scored the first TD on a Collins 1-yard run. Down 20-6 late in the first half, Collins intercepted Scott in the flat on the Wildcats’ first play after Carthage took its 14-point lead on a Collins 10-yard scamper. That was Scott’s first interception since three in the season opener against McDonald County. Fortunately, for the Wildcats, their defense came through with a stand, gang-tackling Guest short of a first down on fourth-and-5 at the Neosho 25. After surrendering 20 points on three of Carthage’s first four possessions, the Wildcat defense answered the bell the rest of the game and Carthage’s last four possessions all ended in Neosho fourth-down stops. On the bright side, Neosho avoided the penalties that had plagued the Wildcats the previous four weeks. There were no touchdowns called back on penalties or opponents’ drives extended due to a needless personal foul. Wildcat offense in shuffle mode Neosho’s first touchdown came on a Klier 66-yard gain off a third-and-3 shuffle pass only 11 seconds into the second quarter and the Wildcats had 99 yards and one TD off those two plays. Page 3 of 4 - All other plays in the first half resulted in a net of 15 yards, the Wildcats hurt by three quarterback sacks on Scott totaling in losses of 25 yards. Neosho picked it up in a second half during which both teams each had three possessions, scoring on its first two after going 1 for 6 in the first half. Up next Neosho, 3-2 overall and 1-2 in the COC Large, hosts the Nixa Eagles on Friday for homecoming. The Wildcats’ juggernaut schedule continues with state-ranked Nixa after state-ranked Carthage and before state-ranked Webb City, the five-time defending Class 4 state champions ranked in the top 20 high school football teams in the United States by USA Today. The Cardinals are currently ranked No. 17. Webb City defeated Nixa 31-16 on Friday night. Cardinals running back Hunter Vanlue rushed for 102 yards and two touchdowns on seven carries, his 53-yard TD run giving Webb City a 14-0 lead in the first half. Keaton Burroughs’ 95-yard TD run opened the scoring, while Nixa’s Logan Tyler, a Florida State recruit at placekicker, scored on a 53-yard TD run for Nixa’s first score. Cory Duley kicked a 44-yard field goal for Webb City and backup quarterback Andrew Greek made it 24-6 halfway through the second quarter with a 9-yard run. Nixa’s backup quarterback Andrew Rivera hit Chase Allen on a 16-yard TD pass for a 24-13 halftime score. Burroughs finished with 165 yards on a night when the Cardinals played without their regular starting quarterback Tyson Roderique. Tyler briefly came out in the second quarter after landing awkwardly on a run. The Eagles and the Wildcats share at least two similarities entering their game next Friday: both teams own 3-2 overall records with both their losses coming against state-ranked opponents, Neosho to fellow Class 5 district opponents Willard and Carthage and Nixa to Class 6 Francis Howell and Class 4 Webb City. The Eagles defeated Willard two weeks ago to knock their rival Tigers out of the Class 5 rankings.

316,"Everyone would love to add value to their home by giving it a look that stands out from the crowd. A lot of people want to be a good interior designer. Luckily, the following article will provide you with advice to help make your home the best one on the block.Use versatile furniture in small rooms. Instead of a sofa, consider using ottomans. The ottoman not only provides seating but can also be used as a table, making use of the small amount of space you have. Using items that have dual purposes help you make the most of a small space.A lot of professionals have things to say about interior design, and you should listen to them only to a certain extent. You cannot create your perfect http://www.home-designing.com/ - http://www.home-designing.com/ - home until you trust your own creativity. So let loose and make your home reflect who you really are.When addressing the decor in a smaller room, make certain to select furniture that easily adapts to other uses. For example, choose ottomans rather than a sofa or chairs. The ottoman can be used as both a place to sit as well as a table. Using items that can serve more than one purpose can help you to make the best use of small spaces.When changing a room's interior decorating, you want to prevent your room from appearing overly-cluttered. If you have an abundance of furniture, your room will be cluttered and cramped. Instead, you can pick out just a few things that will help you open space.When you set out to design a room for a child, use the child's perspective when furnishing it. Think about what they like so that they can appreciate how you redecorate their room. Try to make everything very easy to access. Look at things through your child's eyes and and at their level and get rid of anything that might harm them.Take some time to balance out all of your finances before you invest time into any project. Nothing is worse than starting a project that you can https://www.rebelmouse.com/unsightlywager919/home-interior-decorating-trick-841044277.html - shutters - not finish because you ran out of money for it. You will avoid anxiety and stress with this approach.With a fireplace around, the room containing it will have some design needs. Everything on the mantle should be balanced. A balanced mantle can make your home room look more beautiful and bring attention to a dramatic part of the room.Incorporating trendy designs into your plans can be great. They can make your room look modern and stylish. But, you should only add modern decorations as accents, not permanent fixtures. It is simple to replace them when the fashion changes and you want something new. However, sofa with a wild print will be much harder to replace.At times, replacing the doors of your cabinets is an easy way to redo your kitchen. Among other options, you can change your cabinet doors to glass doors to make them more vibrant. Once the glass is in place, add a few choice pieces you want noticed for additional room appeal.Before beginning any interior decorating project you should have an idea of the amount time you plan on spending in this home. If you are planning on moving, you should keep it simple, neutral, and cheap. Although you may think some additions you want to make are good, sometimes you have to realize that they aren't.If there are a lot of items in your home, you should keep the walls very simple. Some people choose to keep more items than others. When you have lots of keepsakes and sentimental pieces, keep your walls simple and clean to enhance the appeal of these items. Otherwise, your home will seem too cluttered.Slipcovers can be a godsend if you are trying to decorate a room with children in the house. Slip covers will not only protect your furniture, they will allow you to change the look of your room. Swap out slipcovers seasonally or whenever you want a new look.You should be completely thorough if you are doing interior design. Mixing contemporary style furniture in a room with an antique style fireplace could make the room look mismatched. Make sure that your theme stays consistent throughout the house.Painting small rooms in a light color will make it appear larger. Off white is a great color for making a room appear larger, and remember that big furniture pieces effect the lighting as well. Darker colors will make rooms appear smaller.Paint some flower pots made of clay and put real or artificial plants inside them to give your room a brighter look. Have you kids help and use them for plants or to hold other objects.Mix things that do not match. When you combine an animal print pillow with a flower print chair, the look can be amazing. A blue curtain can look sweet behind a yellow upholstered chair. Unusual mixes like this can create an interesting room that is worth talking about.Consider using floor surfaces that are reflective to get the most out of your natural light in interior decorating. Hardwood and white tile are just two options for reflective floors that you can use. Reflective flooring brightens interior rooms; dark carpets and woods absorb natural light.In the playroom, place storage boxes at your child's height. This arrangement makes it easier for children to take an active role in the cleaning and organization of their living areas. It will also help keep the room clean, making it a more functional and pleasant environment.When picking out your coffee table, use your creative side. Rather than simply using a regular table, think about putting a chest in the room or some other piece that makes sense. Search your home and check out numerous flea markets or antique stores. You may be stunned at just how many items can be utilized rather than the old-fashioned coffee table.These tips should help you discover that this process can be completed with the right tools. Put your new knowledge to good use with plans that you lay out ahead of time. Follow the steps needed to finish the plans and you will love the outcome!",3114cd41-02f9-4056-9b14-dff6972686cf,Blog,2015-09-12T08:50:34Z,blogigo.cn,Usage This Guidance To End up being An Interior Decorating Pro,1.0,News
2982,"( LifeSiteNews ) -- The Vatican is reportedly taking offense to Barack Obama’s decision to invite a bevy of controversial guests -- such as a pro-abortion nun, an openly homosexual Episcopal bishop, and gay activist Catholics -- for next week’s papal visit to the White House. 
 
The Wall Street Journal reports that an unnamed senior Vatican official said the Holy See fears that any photos of Pope Francis at next Wednesday’s White House welcoming ceremony with Obama’s guests that openly flout Church teaching could be taken as support for their actions. 
 
Among the Obama administration invites are dissenting, activist Catholic nun Sister Simone Campbell, openly homosexual retired Episcopal bishop Gene Robinson, a transgender woman and a homosexual Catholic blogger. 
 
Sister Campbell is executive director of the social justice group NETWORK and pro-abortion leader of the ""Nuns on the Bus"" campaign. She is seen as having undermined the U.S. Bishops’ concern over Obamacare’s abortion component when the controversial health care takeover was being debated five-and-a-half years ago. 
 
Her Network organization, widely regarded as having radical feminist leanings, was investigated by the Vatican over the group’s refusal to observe Catholic teaching on abortion, human sexuality and women’s ordination. The investigation concluded earlier this year, resulting in minimal repercussions for the group. 
 
Robinson, who “divorced” his homosexual partner last year, and is a senior fellow for the liberal think tank Center for American Progress , has been invited to religious events in the past by Obama, leading a prayer at the president’s 2009 inauguration and taking part in the 2014 National Prayer Breakfast. 
 
Also invited are Mateo Williamson, a biological woman who identifies as a man and a former co-chair of the Transgender Caucus for the pro-homosexual activist  group Dignity USA; and Aaron Ledesma, author of the blog “The Gay Catholic.” 
 
Click ""like"" to support Catholics Restoring the Culture!  
 
The i nvitation organizer for the White House papal event is Vivian Taylor, executive director of the national LGBT advocacy arm of the Episcopal Church, and a biological male. 
 
The unease caused by the guest list demonstrates Catholic concerns, including that of many bishops, the WSJ report said, that the Obama administration is using Pope Francis’s visit to underplay its differences with the Church on controversial issues such as homosexual “marriage,” abortion and the Obamacare contraception Mandate. 
 
U.S. Vatican Ambassador Ken Hackett , named  by Obama  to his post in June 2014, said last month that Pope Francis and Obama are not going to waste time discussing any differences they may have. Rather, they will choose to focus on issues where they see eye-to-eye. 
 
According to Hackett these areas are poverty, religious freedom, concern for persecuted Christians and minorities, and peace. 
 
“Then climate, of course,” Hackett said. 
 
“We agree to differ on things like gay marriage,” he said, “but really there are not a lot of other such issues.” 
 
Pope Francis will visit the U.S for the first time September 22-27. In addition to visiting the White House, he will address a joint session of the U.S. Congress and the U.N. General Assembly, before appearing at the World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia.",e5eee6e8-bb26-451c-b902-de744f56e284,News,2015-09-21T20:33:29Z,LifeSite,Leading Democrat admits abortion isn’t ‘women’s health’,0.0,News
3421,"Denmark has placed advertisements in four Lebanese newspapers announcing tighter regulations and cuts in provisions for asylum-seekers. 
 
The advertisement published on Monday said that social assistance for newly arrived refugees was being reduced by up to 50 percent. 
 
Those granted temporary protection would not have the right to family reunification for the first year of their residence, the ad warned. 
 
New refugees will have to be able to speak and understand Danish in order to obtain a permanent residency.

— Sara Hussein (@sarahussein) September 7, 2015 
 
“There will be a special return centre for rejected asylum-seekers to ensure (they)… leave Denmark as quickly as possible,” the advertisement added. 
 
The new measures went into effect on Tuesday. 
 
Lebanon hosts 1.1 million Syrians who have fled the four-year-long conflict that has devastated their homeland. 
 
Syrians are also the largest nationality among those trying to reach northern Europe via sea crossings to Greece followed by an arduous overland route through the Balkans and Hungary. 
 
Denmark’s Integration Minister Inger Stojberg shared the Arabic version of the advert on her Facebook page  
 
Most of the refugees and migrants are seeking to reach Germany and Sweden, which are known for their openness to asylum claims from Syrians. 
 
Almost half of the claims for asylum lodged by Syrians in European countries have been made in those two countries, with another third lodged in countries along the Balkan route or in the Netherlands, according to UN refugee agency UNHCR. 
 
A total of 348,540 Syrians had lodged asylum claims in Europe by July 2015, according to UNHCR, while more than 4 million are hosted in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt. 
 
Another 7.6 million Syrians are displaced internally, meaning that more than half the country’s pre-war population of 22.4 million has been driven from their homes by the conflict.

3488,"For a woman, her wedding day is the most crucial one in her life. How can a bride retain the most attractive and charming appearance on the day of the wedding after struggling with numerous preparations and handling the small particulars of the wedding day? 
 
The steps below can make it extremely simple for you to turn into an awesome bride! 
 
What is the Best time to Begin Wedding Day Preparations? 
 
The earlier the better! But how do you define early? Actually, it is an everyday responsibility of each woman to care for her skin. It is recommendable that you begin special skin care as well as treatment six to twelve months prior to your wedding day. 
 
Normally, the couple visits the studio for shooting of wedding photos; this is the reason you should begin your skin care early as well as treatment, to ensure you appear great in the photo. 
 
Be Cautious of What You Consume 
 
Being careful of what you consume is extremely vital as it may have a huge impact on the appearance of your skin. Avoid eating excess deep fried meals; rather, opt for more steamed food and vegetables. You will discover that on your wedding day your skin appears revitalized. 
 
You should have breakfast each day and consume less at dinner time. Also, avoid having meals four hours prior to going to bed. It is vital to drink a lot of water and keep away from alcoholic beverages. 
 
Work Out Often 
 
Exercise not only improves your body shape for the fitting and gown; it is also great for the circulation of your blood and it raises the metabolism. You appear more attractive and energetic. 
 
A lot of workouts exist which you can perform. The most successful one is visiting a physician to obtain professional work out. In addition, you can work out with your fiancé to motivate each other. If you are extremely busy working, you can simply exercise by walking up the stairs rather than taking the lift or elevator. 
 
Have Regular Facial Treatment 
 
Visit a beauty centre you have faith in and begin regular facial treatment. Allow the experts to take care of your skin and assist to handle your skin issue immediately. This would be more ideal than panicking due to a pimple on your face some days prior to your wedding. When you begin facial treatment early, this facilitates more time for the recovery of your skin from any facial scars. 
 
Take Note of How You Remove Make-up 
 
Removing your everyday make-up is totally crucial. Residues are harmful to your skin. If possible, avoid make-up prior to your wedding day so as to provide your skin with sufficient time to rest and rejuvenate. 
 
Hair Styling, Make-Up and Dressing 
 
Get in touch with your make-up artist as well as hair stylist as early as you can. Inform them of any skin issues you have and each of your requirements. It would be ideal if you could find a hair stylist who is also a make-up artist as this minimizes the danger of misunderstanding. Experiment with diverse hair styles and make-up prior to your wedding day, so you can find the what hairstyle and makeup give you the most attractive look. 
 
Finding a right bridal gown too is very important. JVSDress recently published a survey that concluded that most women find it very hard to select a white wedding gown that really fits their personality. Make sure that you start your search several days prior to wedding and try to get as many opinions as possible while choosing a perfect dress for your big day. 
 
Relax 
 
A lot of pressures are involved when arranging your wedding. Disagreements and arguments might crop up among your family or even between you and your fiancé. It is extremely vital for you to be aware of how to let go of all the stress and speak to someone. A massage while you are having facial treatment will assist you to let go of the stress. A spa would be ideal also. Resting is the most helpful lotion to facilitate the youthful look of your skin. Get a number of friends to assist you in each of the preparation work. Do not allow each small detail to stress you. 
 
The most vital work for you is to turn into the loveliest bride on the day of your wedding!",b6c31b46-45d4-4940-a6bf-375451e47f3b,News,2015-09-06T21:12:50Z,Examiner.com,A guide on becoming a gorgeous and most exquisite bride on your wedding day,0.0,News
2150,"The Nike Tournament of Champions thought enough of Fremont High School's first appearance in the event last winter that organizers have invited the Tigers back in 2015. 

The FHS girls will be competing in the event, that showcases some of the top prep talent in the nation, Dec. 17-22 in Phoenix. The 96-team tournament is divided into six brackets, but only 32 teams are invited to participate in the top two divisions, including the Tigers. 

""We received a letter from Nike back in April inviting us to come back,"" Fremont coach Tony Weinandt said. ""When we were there last year, we had a really great following. We also heard a lot of positive comments from the people from Nike about the way our kids behaved and the way we competed against some really good teams. We're excited to be going back."" 

The Tigers, led by current University of Nebraska freshman Jessica Shepard, competed in the top bracket of the tournament last December. Fremont finished with a 2-2 record, including wins over Bishop O'Dowd of Oakland, Calif., and Millennium of Goodyear, Ariz. FHS will play in the second bracket this year. 

Weinandt credited FHS Activities Director Bill Fitzgerald and assistant AD Heidi Moran with helping with the administrative details to make the trip happen. 

""A lot of work goes into this, including some fundraising,"" Weinandt said. ""There are also some logistics in school that Bill and Heidi have done a good job with for us."" 

The Tigers are having a silent auction to help with the costs of the trip. Several items have been donated including: 

* Four Skybox tickets and a parking pass to the Nebraska vs. Michigan State football game on Nov. 7. 

* Four Skybox tickets and a parking pass to the Iowa vs. NU game on Nov. 27. 

* Four NU vs. Samford men's basketball tickets and parking pass on Dec. 20. 

* Four Creighton vs. DePaul men's basketball tickets and parking pass for Feb. 6. 

* Four UNO vs. Air Force hockey tickets on Oct. 23. 
 
* Four tickets for the NU vs. Southeastern Louisiana men's basketball game and parking pass on Nov. 22. 

* Four tickets for the Creighton vs. IUPUI basketball game and parking pass on Dec. 12. 

* Four UNO vs. University of Minnesota-Duluth hockey tickets on Nov. 6. 

To bid on an item, go to: www.fpsweb.org and click on the FHS girls basketball silent auction banner. Once there, items will be displayed with instructions. The auction ends at 4 p.m. Friday. 

The Tigers return University of South Dakota commitment Rylie Cascio Jensen, senior guard Meghan Luper and sophomore Sam Shepard from last year's 16-7 squad. 

""We've got a good group of girls,"" Weinandt said. ""We're going to miss our senior class of last year, but we have some girls that played a lot of minutes for us. We might have to change our style a bit, but we have a good nucleus back and we have a lot of kids eager to fill the other open spots.""",06032db4-6d02-48a1-9b11-dd149de0aacf,News,2015-09-24T01:48:00Z,Fremont Tribune,FHS girls invited back to Nike Tournament,0.0,News

ESPN 

reported Tuesday that Pierre-Paul had his right middle finger repaired in an additional surgical procedure and that the tip of his right thumb is gone. 

The middle finger was repaired before he underwent a physical for the Giants on Sept. 7 and then returned to his home in Florida to work out.

Pierre-Paul severely injured the hand in a July 4 fireworks accident that resulted in the loss of his right index finger. 

He is hoping to return to the Giants in five to six weeks, but the new reports of additional damage to the hand further cloud his status.",50c3ad36-8996-474a-9144-0e89a749b886,News,2015-09-16T05:48:00Z,Emirates247,NFL: New York Giants star Jason Pierre-Paul vows to be back with 8 fingers,0.0,News

2127,"Law enforcement officials are urging the public to watch out for sweepstakes scam letters that have been appearing recently in the mailboxes of Kauai residents. 
 
“Recently, we have seen an increase in these types of scams targeting our community. The letters promise huge payouts to the recipient if the recipient first pays a ‘processing fee,’ usually between  $10 and $20,” said Prosecuting Attorney Justin F. Kollar. “These letters often have official-looking seals and signatures and may appear to be very serious, usually urging immediate action and warning recipients not to share the letter or its contents with anyone else.” 
 
These scams often target seniors and retired persons as they tend to be more trusting of unknown individuals. Responsible family members should help to protect them from falling victim. 
 
“The basic rule is that if it looks too good to be true, it probably is,” Kollar said. “Please be very careful anytime you are asked to send money or personal information to somebody you don’t know personally. Once that money is gone, in all likelihood, it is not coming back.” 
 
Residents who have questions or concerns can contact the Office of the Prosecuting Attorney at 241-1888, the Kauai Police Department at 241-1711, or the County of Kauai Agency on Elderly Affairs, 241-4470.

Being the busy woman that I am, writing some 10,000 words a week on average while traveling Europe, I am not someone who can easily say no to such offers.  
 
So, when Jonathan Spektor asked me if I would welcome a guest post of his, and I checked what he was doing, I say yes, right away. By the way, you should check him out too. 
 
So, without further ado, take it away Jonathan… 
 
Blogging Secret. 
 
I have been selling products and services online for over 10 years now. 
 
I remember my first foray into online business. 
 
It was in the early days of eBay. 
 
I would go to Rice’s flea market in New Hope, PA with my girlfriend, now wife and mother of two beautiful children.  We would go and buy beanie babies and other trinkets to list on eBay.  I made quite a bit of money for a college kid at the time. 
 
I had plenty of spending money for cheeseburgers and beer. 
 
Over the years, I started a number of online businesses.  They all made a little bit more money each time. 
 
But online business and ecommerce have changed over the years.  With change I had to adapt. 
 
  
 Google Changed and we Followed  
About 6 years ago, Google made some serious improvements to their search algorithms. 
 
Gone were the days of keyword stuffing your Meta tags and having your site rank highly in search results.  Remember those days? 
 

 
Between the keywords, a title and description with “Dog” you could rank for Dogs in no time.  How rudimentary that seems now. 
 
It worked back then though. 
 
Google’s new search algorithm was different.  It was starting to take page content into account.   Google started checking for relevancy and quality of content. 
 
By this time, my partner Bobby and I had realized we had to adapt our online businesses to this change. 
 
Most of our traffic was highly targeted to niche businesses.  We had focused on keywords based on the products or services that we were selling.  We based our domain names, product titles, and descriptions around the vertical we were targeting. 
 
But this was no longer enough.  We had to start blogging. 
 
  
 Cold Hearted Ecommerce Blogging  
We realized we had to embrace blogging in a big way. 
 
Other sites were starting to rank for our search terms. 
 
So we created blogs on our sites.  The idea was to create new, unique content, based around our verticals. 
 
We would then capture people from related keyword searches.  Once on our site, we would draw them towards our primary sales goal. 
 
The problem was that many of our sites were in verticals that we weren’t experts in.  We didn’t need incredible content, but didn’t want to publish junk either. 
 
We decided we would find professionals in each of the spaces.  We would contract writers and outsource our blogging posts weekly. 
 
HINT: You can hire Sylviane to do this for you if you don’t have the time. 
 
Each week I would provide the bloggers with the keyword we were targeting for each post.  They would generate at least a 500 word post and send it back to us. 
 
We would grab a creative commons image, plug it in, and publish it. 
 
Guess What? 
 
This process worked, and once again we were driving sales and converting traffic. 
 
Our rankings increased and we were good again, at least for a while. 
 
  
 The Posts were Terrible  
The blog posts were driving traffic, but they were awful..  The blog posts lacked personality. 
 
They were written by a hodgepodge of different bloggers.  The posts did nothing to foster a community. 
 
We were producing blogs for zombies. 
 
The process worked.  Zombies came through search engine traffic and purchased.  But it didn’t resonate with people. 
 
They were blog posts without feeling. 
 
They didn’t incorporate stories from real life situations. 
 

 
But who cares, you may ask? 
 
You should, and we do now. 
 
Here is why… 
 
  
 Let’s All Hug and Blog Together  
Sylviane has built an incredible blog over the years.   With this blog she has built an incredible community.  That’s you guys. 
 
This isn’t luck. 
 
This is perseverance and transparency. 
 
Sylviane is real and tells us about herself. 
 
She shares great posts like this one about low self esteem , or this one discussing tough times . 
 
These posts help us get to know Sylviane and where she has come from.  I love these little stories that delve into people’s lives, and I don’t think I’m alone. 
 
Stories draw in readers and show your personality.  They show your true feelings and let people understand your message. 
 
This transparency is priceless and powerful. 
 

 
This is a large reason that Bobby and I launched our blog .  We wanted to build a community.  If we could help people start their ecommerce businesses that was a plus. 
 
  
 My Big Regret  
In all the years that I have been making money online, I never built a community. 
 
I never wrote about myself or my online businesses. 
 
I was passionate about them, but didn’t want it to come off as bragging or knowing more than the next guy. 
 
I wasn’t comfortable sharing.  And to be 100% transparent, I’m still not comfortable with it. 
 
I don’t like self-promotion or chest pumping. 
 
It’s not my style. 
 
I’d rather have a conversation with someone to learn about them, rather than talk about myself. 
 
A wise man once said: “You never learn anything by speaking” 
 
I have taken this advice to extremes. 
 
I always try and extract as much information as I can from people I meet. 
 
So over the years, I spent my time listening and not speaking. 
 
But speaking and promoting, unfortunately, is what helps you succeed.  So I started blogging on Long Live The Internet with two missions. 
  To help people learn from our successes and failures to build their own ecommerce site.  To push myself out of my comfort zone, and build a community of like-minded people interested in ecommerce.   
So like Sylviane, I try and get personal and tell people a funny story or something about me.  I try and incorporate a little something into each blog post. 
 
  
 Enough About Me… What’s Bad About Community Blogging  
Ok so that’s the answer right? 
 
The magic answer is to be real and to blog transparently. 
 
Just publish nice content and your audience will grow. 
 
Over time they will naturally buy your products or services. 
 
Not So Fast… 
 
Blogging for a community is rewarding.  It brings clarity, and for me, helps relieve some stress.  But let’s not lose track of what this post is about. 
 
We are trying to drive traffic to an ecommerce site.  We are trying to sell and make money. 
 
Blogging for a community can take years to grow and we are trying to pay the bills now with an ecommerce site. 
 
We don’t have the luxury of building our community slowly. 
 
So after many years and many experiments, I’m ready to tell you my secret recipe for blogging for ecommerce, and driving sales. 
 
  
 The Secret to Blogging for Ecommerce  
The secret is straightforward. 
 
You can’t go all-in on either of these two approaches.  You have to find the blend of the two blogging styles that works for your audience.  Let’s look quickly at the pros and cons of the two approaches to blogging. 
 Cold-hearted Keyword Blogging  
Pros 
 
– You can drive search engine traffic quickly 
 
– You don’t have to write the posts yourself 
 
– Small investments in an outsourced post often pay for themselves quickly 
 
– You free up your time 
 
Cons 
 
– The traffic is frugal.  They are quick to leave and have no allegiance 
 
– It’s hit or miss and some posts do incredibly well while others flop 
 
– You aren’t building any allegiance to your brand or site 
 
– It feels impersonal and “icky” 
 Transparent Community Blogging  
Pros 
 
– The traffic is recurring 
 
– People trust you and your proposition 
 
– You can make more than one sale and with a higher conversion rate 
 
– If you shift course your people will follow 
 
Cons 
 
– This can take years to grow 
 
– You have to produce lots of good content over and over 
 
– You have to write most posts yourself 
 
– You have to be transparent (this can take some getting used to) 
 
Now you can see the differences clearly. 
 
So what should you do? 
 
  
 Your Own Recipe  
If you are blogging for Ecommerce, you need targeted traffic. 
 
Additionally, you need to build trust with your audience. 
 
You can do this in a number of ways. 
 
For example, my wife’s fashion jewelry site combines a little of both styles. 
 
She personally interviews a featured jewelry designer each month.  This brings a personal angle to the blog and builds trust with readers. 
 
Between these personal posts, she has blog posts that are purely informational.  These are less community oriented but attract search engine traffic. 
 
This approach of combining personality posts, along with keyword rich posts, works. 
 
It has helped her build an impressive online business with consistent traffic.  I may have helped some also. 
 
Over the years Bobby and I have started implementing this technique throughout our online businesses. 
 
Over time we saw increased traffic, higher return rates and increased conversions.  Despite the statistical improvements, we are feeling more transparent. 
 
It’s important to make this combination work for you.  Each ecommerce site, and offering, is slightly different.  If you are the face of a brand, then you need to focus on being honest and transparent often. 
 
If the ecommerce business is about the actual products, you can publish more search engine traffic posts. 
 
Tie in personalization by mentioning how these products relate to you or others you know. 
 
  
 In Closing  
Putting real people and real situations into your blog posts can help build trust and a community. 
 
You can build an audience that comes back to buy from you. 
 
More importantly, you are providing social proof and addressing a major buyer concern.  Remove obstacles to the sale, and you increase your bottom line. 
 
In summary, you can’t afford to ignore keyword research and blogging for traffic.  But, once you get the zombies to your site, relate to them and show them your brand is real. 
 
This equates to increased sales and customers who rally around your brand. 
 
  
 
Agree? Disagree?  I would love to know what is or isn’t working for your ecommerce blogging in the comments below.

1790,"SAN MATEO, Calif. , and NEW YORK , Sept. 10, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Feedzai , a data science company that uses real-time, machine-based learning to analyze big data and minimize risk in the financial services industry, today announced a partnership with Socure , the industry leader in real-time online identity verification solutions. Working together, the two companies will provide their mutual clients with a ""plug-and-play"" solution that combines online and social data-based authentication with fraud risk scoring. 

Feedzai will incorporate the Socure Social Biometrics™ Platform as part of its Fraud Prevention That Learns™ software to provide ultra-fast processing of Big Data to minimize fraudulent transactions, chargebacks and reduce manual reviews costs for financial institutions.

Feedzai also announced updates to its software platform that provide improved risk management and fraud prevention solutions. Its powerful machine learning software is now being used for a variety of financial applications beyond transaction authorization, such as new account opening and loss prevention. 

""Financial organizations today face many risks that were not present even a few years ago, like 'card not present' fraud and the large number of consumers who are creditworthy but credit history -poor,"" said Nuno Sebastiao , co-founder and CEO of Feedzai. ""At the same time, there is an enormous amount of data that these organizations can use, not only to provide better experiences for their customers and prospects, but to differentiate themselves in the marketplace as well. Over the last year, we've fine tuned our machine learning platform to help organizations manage risks and rationalize data output from various internal systems."" 

With the Socure partnership, online and social data becomes another source of data that Feedzai's software uses to detect fraud and minimize risks. Additional data sources used by Feedzai include session clickstream, access frequency, and malware signatures, among others. Feedzai's Fraud Prevention That Learns™ platform is now being used in the following cases outside of transaction authorization: 
Merchant Signup : Verifies, underwrites and monitors merchants against collusion and insolvency.  Account Opening : Works to onboard and verify new account applications and ""thin-file"" applications.  Chargeback Management : Prevents payment chargeback reversals, disputes, penalty fees or merchandise loss due to fraudulent sales.  Information Services : Performs advanced data visualization through its analytics platform.  Loss Prevention : Monitors internal processes and external data sources to protect against data exfiltration and employee collusion. 
""The transaction fraud protection Feedzai provides for financial institutions is best of breed for the industry,"" said Sunil Madhu , co-founder and CEO of Socure. ""Social Biometrics from Socure is the perfect complement, making it even more powerful.  The power of the joint solution from Socure and Feedzai is the biggest innovation to the B2C identity lifecycle for some time to come,"" he added. 
 
As instances of credit card fraud, identity theft, and related risks to financial payments systems continue to grow, the danger for private citizens, banks and other institutions takes an increasingly costly toll. Socure works to protect them by leveraging its patented Social Biometrics technology--at the cutting edge of analytics, machine learning, facial recognition and artificial intelligence. 

Feedzai Fraud Prevention That Learns™ technology fuses big data and machine learning to allow analysts to distinguish normal from abnormal behaviors, which can predict and prevent losses in real-time. The software uses complex event processing to aggregate and process high-volume streams of big data, including mobile and social data streams, to create deep learning profiles for each customer, merchant, location or POS device, product, with up to a three-year history of data behind it. This analysis and process helps acquirers, issuers, and retailers mitigate risk, guard every transaction, and preserve the customer experience. 

About Feedzai 

Every day, the world produces petabytes of data, and Feedzai enables businesses to accurately analyze this information to keep their customers' data and transactions safe at any place in real-time. Customers use Feedzai's Fraud Prevention That Learns™ software to reduce risks associated with banking and shopping, whether it's in person, online or via mobile devices, by detecting fraud through deep historical and behavioral analysis of the organization's data.

786,"A state audit found the Missouri Department of Revenue is holding at least $20 million in cash bonds from closed businesses. Credit selbstfotografiert / Wikimedia Common Missouri retail businesses can pay the Department of Revenue for a sales tax license through a cash bond. But Missouri law requires the department to return the bonds back to businesses following two years of tax compliance. State auditor Nicole Galloway said the department will only return bonds when businesses request a refund. “But they do not actively seek out these businesses that are in compliance to get their money back to them,” Galloway said. “And I find that I have an issue with that.” She said some of the bonds date all the way back to 1980. “The Department of Revenue has an obligation to actively seek out businesses to refund the money that they are owed,” Galloway said. “And every dollar the department does not refund back to business owners is dollars that can be reinvested back into the community or back into that business.” Galloway also said $20 million is a low estimate because it only includes bonds held from closed businesses. She said the department has not provided estimates for the number of cash bonds held from open businesses.

Art and Automotive Worlds Combine During New York Art Auction Season

The 1971 24 Hours of Le Mans N.A.R.T. 365 GTB/4 Daytona VIN 12467

At its unveiling at the Paris Auto Salon in 1968, the striking Ferrari 365 GTB/4 was immediately hailed as a masterwork. However, through June of 1971, the beautiful Berlinetta had not yet proven itself as the dominant competition machine it would become. A prototype race version was built and promptly crashed at the 1969 24 Hours of Le Mans, and only a middle field finish came much later in 1971. Nonetheless, North American Racing Team patriarch Luigi Chinetti Sr. 

Accordingly, Daytona 12467 was modified from a standard road car for N.A.R.T. and entered in the 1971 24 Hours of Le Mans. This era is still considered the golden age of road racing, due to the colossal battle between Ferrari and Porsche, and their awe inspiring 5-liter World Sports car Championship machines. Out of the box, in the world's most grueling race, '12467' finished a stunning fifth position overall, behind only the much larger and more powerful WSC machines. It came in eight laps ahead of the GT cars that it would be classified against in the future. By the end of that summer, with the requisite 500 road cars completed for homologation, the first of three batches (eventually totaling 15) of official Ferrari factory-prepared Daytona Competiziones were at the 1972 24 Hours of Le Mans. The racing world watched as a flank of Daytonas took fifth through ninth place overall, once again behind only WSC machines, and swept the GT class podium. The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona represents the final front engine road-based racecar built under the gaze of Enzo Ferrari 

""The N.A.R.T. Daytona is an example of our vision to carefully curate and celebrate, when possible, automobiles with unique origins, or notable achievements in history,"" said Co-CEO and Founder, Leigh Keno

Happy Labor Day! Today we had off from school and work .... so it was a family day! Woo hoo!
I had insomnia this morning, so I cycled before everyone got up. ;-) After breakfast daddy ran on the treadmill. Joshua drew and the girls had a dance party. I played with the twins. Jacob is getting better at walking. Jeremiah loves to clap his hands! Ha! ;-)
We made a quick trip to Target after lunch since we were out of milk and other little things. Once home, we all walked to the park. ;-) It was fun to get some fresh air! The twins loved the swings! You two were so cute and I took a video. Jeremiah, you kept tucking your feet inside the swing seat so you looked like you were sitting in an egg! Ha! Everyone got a shower or bath after we got home .... you all were 5 little sweaty kids. ;-)
This evening we watched part of a movie with an Illusionist .... Gigi and Grandpa Jim have it to us. You all liked the floating table and sawing a woman in half. Oh my!

533,"Pope Francis prayed for the ongoing negotiations between FARC rebels and the Colombian government happening in Cuba right now saying that “another failure” is not an option.     “Please, we do not have the right to allow ourselves yet another failure on this path of peace and reconciliation,” he said following the Sept. 20 Sunday Angelus in Revolution Square.     Since 1964, more than 200,000 people have been killed in Colombia’s civil war. For the past three years, Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels and the Colombian government have been engaged in peace talks in Cuba, but an outcome has not yet been reached.     “At this time I feel bound to direct my thoughts to the beloved land of Colombia,” he said, “conscious of the crucial importance of the present moment when, with renewed effort and inspired by hope, its sons and daughters are seeking to build a peaceful society.”     Although much innocent blood has been shed in the decades of armed conflict, he hopes that their sacrifice, united with Christ’s, may “sustain all the efforts being made, including those on this beautiful island, to achieve definitive reconciliation.”     “Thus may the long night of pain and violence can, with the support of all Colombians, become an unending day of concord, justice, fraternity and love, in respect for institutions and for national and international law, so that there may be lasting peace,” the Holy Father said.     Turning his attention to the example of the Blessed Mother, the pontiff urged those present to “place all our concerns and hopes before the heart of Christ.”     “We pray to her in a special way for those who have lost hope and find no reasons to keep fighting, and for those who suffer from injustice, abandonment and loneliness,” he said.     Like Mary, we must learn to “keep our hearts awake and attentive to the needs of others” and the “little details of life” so that no one will lack “the joy which Jesus brings us.”     Pope Francis then prayed for all those experiencing difficulty, especially the Cubans whom he called the “sons and daughters” of Mary.",7a405783-cdc6-4083-ad5d-d23144e89da3,News,2015-09-20T23:40:00Z,Angelus The Tidings Online,"Colombian peace talks must not fail, Pope says during Cuba trip",0.0,News

1417,"Last Year, God Told Rick Joyner The New England Patriots Would Win The Super Bowl Submitted by Kyle Mantyla on Wednesday, 9/2/2015 12:02 pm On yesterday's ""Prophetic Perspective on Current Events"" program, Rick Joyner revealed that, prior to the start of last year's NFL season, God personally told him that the New England Patriots would win the Super Bowl and that it would be ""a prophetic message that patriotism is going to win this year."" Joyner said that God regularly shows him ""through sporting events some prophetic scenarios,"" and so, last year, he asked God when He was going to let the Carolina Panthers finally win a Super Bowl. God reportedly told Joyner ""don't give up on the Panthers,"" which Joyner interpreted to mean that the Panthers would not have a very good year but ""it could end up good,"" which is exactly what happened when the team made it into the playoffs despite having a losing record and even won a Wild Card game. But more importantly, God told Joyner that the Patriots would win the Super Bowl, though Joyner wisely decided not to share that information publicly because otherwise people would have used it to gamble. ""The Lord told me the Patriots were going to win,"" he said. ""I knew the Lord said and he was saying it as a prophetic message that patriotism is going to win this year.  And that's what's going to win and you're going to see Americans becoming patriotic again. And I knew that was a message and I think that's important for us to understand and, for that reason, I was kind of happy when the Patriots won it all, I knew we're going to see this unfold.""

The thing that I really harp on is that, that in and of itself is a choice, it’s a personal choice, because there are many people who don’t do that. In buying those uniforms, you’re saying something about yourself, and about how you feel about clothing and culture. There is no such thing as an unaffected fashion choice.

3482,"A team of rowers are completing a 1,000-mile journey around the coast of Ireland today. 

The crew who set out from Bray on the May 30 last will arrive back in Wicklow this afternoon. 

The rowers are raising money for the charity Cystic Fibrosis Ireland and have raised over €75,000 so far. 



Organiser of Row-Around-Ireland Ger Crowley said it was a challenging task to undertake. 

“There were hairy moments obviously when you go out in the North Atlantic it is very unpredictable,” he said. 

“We have no safety boat, we have no back-up boat with us or boat to accompany us around so when we headed out to sea, it was an adventure every time. 

“I must say thankfully that the weather was good to us and kind to us, conditions were chosen as to when we went out.”

2021,"If you plan to undertake major repairs or structural improvements to your home, you will undoubtedly need a permit to do so legally. Whether you live within the Ukiah city limits or in the unincorporated part of Mendocino County, there’s a planning and building department for you. 

When do you need a permit? Any time you mess with a utility like gas or electricity, any time you do structural work, any time you build a retaining wall taller than three feet, and any time you build a deck, for starters. If you simply plan to paint your bedroom a lovely shade of lavender, you need not alert the authorities, but if you build a walk-in closet, it’s permit time. 
  
Depending on where you live, you’ll either choose the city or county building department. You’ll likely need to submit drawings of your intended repair or improvement, as well as structural calculations. The building department folks will then assess a fee and issue a permit (provided your plans adhere to building and zoning codes). Once the work is done, a city or county inspector will confirm that the work is complete and to code, and issue a final permit. 

I cannot tell you how many unpermitted repairs and improvements have been discovered during the sale of a property. And even without a sale, if you started the permit process but never obtained final approval, you not only have no permit, you have notified the authorities of this fact. 
  
Because many people (or their contractors) are competent to do repairs or improvements, they think they don’t need a permit, but they do. If they ever want to sell the property, they’re now obligated by law to disclose to prospective buyers that unpermitted work was done. 

So in addition to paying a hefty penalty, the work that was done must meet current code (not the code that was in effect when the repair or improvement was completed). If the repair or improvement cannot be brought up to code, or if it does not comply with current zoning requirements, the building department may require that the repair or improvement be removed. No, I am not kidding. 
  
Bear in mind that not all repairs or improvements are brick and mortar. Grading a driveway, for example, requires a permit depending on how much earth is moved and the driveway’s proximity to nearby bodies of water. I am aware of a situation where a driveway was constructed without a permit and not to code, and the county required that the property be restored to its original condition. The restoration cost exceeded the value of the property. So a word to the wise: get a permit. 

In addition to building and zoning codes, some houses must comply with covenants, conditions and restrictions (CC&Rs)—go to http://richardselzer.com/2014/09/08/covenants-and-conditions-and-restrictions-oh-my  for more about those. Long story short, if you live in a subdivision, there are likely limitations about the height of fences, whether you can build a second story, or even what color you can paint your house. 
 
 
  
Just save yourself the time, money and headache of trying to get a permit after the fact, and get it up front. Do the work, get the inspection, then put the final permit somewhere you can put your hands on it, should you ever need to. Remember, if you sell your home, improvements can be deducted from the sales price in determining if and how much capital gains tax you pay. Generally, the first $500,000 is deductible for a married couple who has lived in the house for at least two of the last five years.

2016,"The first major successful compromise of Apple's iOS App Store is far worse than first reported. The XcodeGhost malware was spread through iOS apps via compromised versions of Apple's development Xcode app, and original reports claimed the number of infected apps was 39. According to a new report , FireEye Labs began scanning the App Store after the initial report was released and has since found over 4,000 compromised apps. 
Inspired by the CIA?  
The iOS malware, found to be used to collect information and run phishing schemes, may have a connection to the CIA. A report from March, 2015, by The Intercept, noted that documents leaked by Edward Snowden claim CIA researchers detailed a way to manipulate Xcode in order to inject malware into apps without the developer knowing. Additional reports from March, 2014, also based on leaked Snowden documents, claimed the NSA infiltrated Chinese telecom company Huawei . 
 
According to Ryan Olson, director of threat intelligence for Unit 42 at Palo Alto Networks, there is no evidence that the CIA was involved in the attacks, but the agency may have influenced the attackers. 
 
""The timing of the release of the Intercept report (March 10, 2015) and the first upload of the malicious Xcode packages (March 23, 2015) suggests that attacker may have been inspired by this news,"" Olson said. ""The leaked information wasn’t really a blueprint for how to launch the attack, but it could have sparked the idea."" 
 
The CIA has declined to comment on the contents of the original leaked documents, and has not responded to inquiries as to whether this attack vector was reported to Apple. 
 Apple's response  
Apple has said it has been working to remove infected apps, and has detailed ways for developers to make sure they are using uncompromised versions of Xcode. The iOS malware has apparently spread quickly because it was much faster for Chinese developers to download the Xcode app from third-party sources, which were found to be hosting hacked versions of the software. 
 
Phil Schiller, senior vice president of worldwide marketing at Apple Inc., spoke to Chinese reporters recently and admitted this was true. Schiller said the average download of the 3GB Xcode software package took 25 minutes in the US, but could take as long as three hours in China. Apple is reportedly looking into hosting the software locally in China to improve speeds and mitigate the issue. 
 
Apple has not responded to questions on whether it was aware of the alleged CIA techniques for compromising Xcode. 
 
However, Liviu Arsene, senior e-threat researcher for Romania-based antimalware firm Bitdefender, said the issue of stopping developers from downloading hacked versions of the Xcode software could have been caught sooner. 
 
""In light of this event we can assume that the team that orchestrated this event exploited the issue of poor download speed of the Xcode software in China, in order to trick developers into using a tampered version of the Xcode IDE ,"" Arsene said. ""Because this type of attack has not been seen before, it’s safe to assume that developers will be more mindful of locations from where they download such tools. However, this could have been averted in the first place if caution were exercised prior to this incident.""",2ad26f6c-4b42-4284-8257-cb2e1cb0204f,News,2015-09-24T05:53:15Z,SearchSecurity.com,"iOS Xcode app infections over 4,000",0.0,News

2651,"682- Today's Prime Time Devo comes from 2Sa 22:37 You enlarged my path under me; So my feet did not slip. I don't know about you, but when I drive in the mountains on roads without guardrails, I freak out. I get queasy just looking at video of some of the crazy trails that people have carved out of mountains. If there is height involved, I want a very wide trail with very high railings. David points out here that we don't need to live our lives precariously. God is more than willing and able to widen the road beneath our feet and give us sure footing. He does this with His Word. John the Baptist came preaching the Word of repentance. He established the grade and Jesus came and paved the way to heaven with the Gospel. Mr 1:2 As it is written in the Prophets: ""Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, Who will prepare Your way before You."" 3 ""The voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the LORD; Make His paths straight.'"" 4 John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. This preaching of the Word opened the way of salvation through faith in the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world! Here's the thing about God's Word. It not only leads to salvation but it is an ever-widening road of wisdom and understanding as we prayerfully read and study it with the help of the Holy Spirit. This Word will give us sure footing as we travel the road of life. As it says in Pr 4:10-15, “ Hear, my son, and receive my sayings, And the years of your life will be many. 11 I have taught you in the way of wisdom; I have led you in right paths. 12 When you walk, your steps will not be hindered, And when you run, you will not stumble. 13 Take firm hold of instruction, do not let go; Keep her, for she is your life. 14 Do not enter the path of the wicked, And do not walk in the way of evil. 15 Avoid it, do not travel on it; Turn away from it and pass on.

Sometimes the feelings are stormy, and sometimes they’re calm.       Towards the 9 month mark, you start to confront the reality of your loss and your more intense feelings of sadness, anger, heartbreak, fear, guilt and depression.  Somewhere in the second year you start to accept your loss and start to make accommodations in your life for your loss.  Your feelings begin to feel less intense and you experience more moments of peace and happiness.  As you feel and express your feelings during the different phases of your grief, remember:  it is not that you are having a bad day, but a grieving day.  Just as you cannot stop the waves in the ocean, you cannot stop the feelings of grief.  You can only ride the wave of your grief and find a comfortable place to express it.  Find time to be with your pain now; postponed grief returns later.  Connect yourself with what you have lost, your old sense of self or the person you lost.
Wendy Feiereisen describes how grief changes as we embrace it in her poem, “Grief”:
You don’t get over it. You just get through it. You don’t get by it. Because you can’t get around it. It doesn’t “get better”. It just gets different. Every day, grief puts on a new face. Yearning and searching for what you lost is another way of protesting the loss. It is typical during this time to review many of the “If only…” thoughts.   Again there are no answers to these thoughts. “If  only…I should have…I could have…” are phrases that reflect our intense desire to have control over what happened.  When you hear yourself using these phrases, picture a barrier at the top of a slope and stop yourself from finishing the thought.  Remember, at the bottom of this slippery slope is a dead end and if you continue your “if only” and “should have”  thoughts, you will slide down the slope and then need to climb back up.   
During this phase there is the sensation that it was a mistake; everything will go back to the way it was, my loved one is going to walk through the door any minute or my health will return.  This sensation is usually gone by the 9th month and many people experience this as a particularly intense period of grieving.  Somewhere around this time, you begin to move in and out of the avoidance phase and into the confrontation phase as you confront the reality that you will not find what you lost.
Confrontation Phase
This phase starts with the recognition that your life will not return to the way it was.  You have moved beyond feeling that your life is surreal and into recognizing that the way your life is now is your new normal.   Your grief during this time is very intense with your feelings being very acute and at times overwhelming, resulting in a state of disorganization.    
YES!  This helps explain why I've been feeling so emotional  and at such ""loose ends"" lately. This ninth month brings with it the excruciating  labor pains of birthing a new normal.",c1633168-3281-4eb0-aae7-37cd1cb898e1,Blog,2015-09-16T00:17:23Z,Just M.E.,The Ninth Month,1.0,Blog

2516,"LOUISVILLE, KY (WAVE) – Red spray paint was used to write several anti-Islamic messages on the exterior of a building of worship.

The vandalism was discovered Wednesday afternoon at the Louisville Islamic Center, located in the 4000 block of River Road.

[MORE: Children getting drunk on hand sanitizer]

Curse words and a Star of David were among the graffiti sprayed all over the Islamic Center.

Despite the hateful messages, it didn't take long for members of the Jewish community to come to Mosque. Those who were there were quick to back their brothers and sisters of the Muslim faith.

The mosque has been a place of worship for the Muslim community of Louisville for years. But this, this is the first time it has been the target of vandalism.

Muhammad Babar, a spokesman for the Louisville Islamic Center, sent the following letter to the city's Islamic community early Thursday morning:

Dear All,

I know that this has been a long tiring evening for everyone. We knew that hatred will hit us one day but there was always a brink of hope that our community outreach efforts may deflect it away from us. But fact of the matter is that we are hit hard right here in our compassionate city of Louisville at a place that is center of tolerance and compassion.

This is the same house of God where few months ago we condemned acts of brutality committed by ISIS in the name of our faith. Today hate crime is committed by someone who shares the similar philosophy of hatred and bigotry like ISIS. This reminds us extremists belonging to every faith tradition share common thought process to further their agenda.

Believe me, we will come out even stronger as a community of people of faith and more importantly as Muslim Americans. USA is our home and nobody can scare us away from our adopted homeland. We love land of free more than ourselves and will not let anyone push us away as if we do not exist or if our voices do not matter. We will fight hatred and bigotry with compassion and love as Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), Jesus and Moses did centuries ago. God willing our compassion will overcome all kind of adversities and troubles that future may hold for us.

A quick update on the proceedings of the evening. Police report has been filed with Indian Hills police and FBI is investigating it as a hate crime as well. We were also able to activate media at such a short notice and all four local tv channels (WHAS, WLKY, WAVE 3, WDRB), courier journal and WFPL ((NPR) have covered this incident. Tomorrow morning at 8.30 am, Mayor Fischer will hold a press conference at Islamic center along with local interfaith leaders. Most importantly, on Friday at 3.00 pm there will be a community cleanup to paint over the acts of vandalism at the Islamic center.

We are especially thankful to Mayor Fischer for his leadership and our law enforcement agencies for their prompt action. We also appreciate outpouring of support from many dear community friends including Tom Williams (Compassionate Louisville), Rhody Streeter and many others. Our own Maira Ansari as usual was at her best in supporting community.

We hope that you all will be able to join Friday's community cleanup with CHILDREN and YOUTH as they need to witness this act of compassion to understand that every adversity brings out something good. Unfortunately they will be facing tougher challenges than us in coming days and we need to prepare them for it.

In the end, we are lucky to call USA home as this the most tolerant place on earth as we know well what minorities are going through in our land of birth. May God keep you all safe and sound with families. Ameen.

Regards,

Muhammad Babar

Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, Councilwoman Angela Leet along with Babar and members of the Islamic faith announced a press conference for 8:30 a.m. Thursday at the Islamic Center.

The community plans to cleanup and paint over the graffiti at 3 p.m. on Friday.

Officers with the Indian Hills Police Department are investigating the case.

4755,"Last week, I posted about our new photovoltaic (PV) array simulators, models N8737APV and N8757APV. These power supplies can produce an I-V curve as their output characteristic and provide up to 15 kW, 1500 V, and 30 A. Today, I am posting about yet another new series of Keysight power products (wow, our R&D team has been busy!). This new family is at the opposite end of the power spectrum compared to the 15 kW PV array simulators. The new family consists of five models in the 30 to 40 W range with voltages up to 100 V and currents up to 5 A all providing a standard rectangular output characteristic. Click here for the press release that just went out yesterday!
I really like this new family of power supplies and I think you will too!
Why?
Because….
You can choose from a variety of voltage and current combinations to meet your needs.
You can save space on your bench with these very compact models that are only 2U high and ¼-rack-width wide.
You can set and read back very accurate voltage and current values with a basic accuracy of 0.05%.
You can view the high visibility OLED display from nearly any angle.
You can regulate your set voltage at your load to make up for voltage drop in your load leads with remote sense terminals and leads.
You can communicate with these power supplies with either LAN or USB since both interfaces are included.
You can protect your device under test with the built in overvoltage protection and overcurrent protection.
And you can easily access all of the other beneficial features in this tiny package with the on-screen menu system.
So you can see that there is a lot you can do with these compact power packages!
Here is a listing of the models:
Below is a picture of the family showing each of the five new models. So the next time you have to equip your bench with DC power that goes beyond a basic power supply, consider the new E36100 Series Programmable DC Power Supplies from Keysight Technologies. I know I would (but then again…..look where I work…..)!",d05b15e8-1099-487e-9bea-99dfa8f6d9ba,Blog,2015-09-03T02:01:41Z,Watt's Up?,"Yet another new Keysight power product family - this time, compact bench-top DC power!",1.0,Blog

1519,"Perth Airport is implementing Amadeus’ ACUS, a cloud-based technology to benefit airline customers and travelers. This agreement marks Amadeus’ continued expansion of its airport IT business in the Asia Pacific region, with Perth Airport its first customer in Australia. 

The next generation, cloud-based ACUS solution will make use of application virtualisation, allowing passenger processing systems to be accessed and deployed anywhere, on demand. This means airlines can use the platform from a desktop computer, laptop or mobile device, and enables passengers to be checked-in and boarding passes to be printed from any location. 

Ground handlers will also be able to handle passenger processing for multiple airlines at the same time from any gate or terminal and from any device. 

Any combination of applications can be hosted without any constraint or limitation on the actual workstation or device. The common use platform will also simplify user training, allowing for the rapid deployment of new employees. 

The infrastructure and hardware reduction also means that Amadeus’ environmentally-friendly platform is expected to help Perth Airport reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and improve its environmental footprint. 

Rowan Chalmers, Perth Airport Executive General Manager Operations and Customer Experience said that  this partnership  will put Perth Airport in a more proactive, reliable and flexible position when it comes to the check-in process. 

“The advanced systems we are delivering with Amadeus will provide a higher level of customer experience. During our selection process, it became clear that Amadeus was the only common use provider to truly deliver on the cloud-based model, bringing clear financial and structural benefits,” he said.  

The investment in technology aligns with Perth Airport’s AUD$1 billion overall transformation of infrastructure. 

“Moving to the Amadeus’ cloud-based common use system means we will be able to cut passenger processing costs by more than 25 per cent for our airline partners. That was a key consideration when selecting this new and innovative system,” Chalmers said.  

Caroline Wilkie, Chief Executive Officer, Australian Airports Association said the introduction of the Amadeus platform was another example of how Australian airports were investing in the latest technology to deliver better and more flexible services for passengers and airlines. 

“As Australian airports continue to handle ever increasing numbers of passengers and aircraft movements, their adoption of innovative technology solutions will help in providing a better experience for passengers while also meeting the operational needs of their airline customers,” Wilkie said. 

“Airports across the world are under pressure to think differently in order to handle increasingly significant numbers of passengers, and modern technology has a huge role to play. The deployment of ACUS is only the beginning of our partnership with Perth Airport, and we look forward to continuing to work closely together,” said John Jarrell, Head of Airport IT, Amadeus. 

This partnership follows the launch of ACUS at Innsbruck Airport, announced in February and the major deal signed with The Avinor Group in June to adopt ACUS in the airports it operates in Norway.",bf5586d3-41cf-45a6-8bb4-9b8967f95e9f,News,2015-09-02T14:35:01Z,Network World Asia,Perth Airport adopts Amadeus' cloud technology to...,0.0,News

2324,"Kevin de Bruyne and Raheem Sterling were on top-form as Manchester City cruised  to a 4-1 Capital One Cup victory at Sunderland to end a two-game losing run in explosive fashion. 
 
The £100million duo tore the Black Cats apart on a night when the Barclays Premier League leaders demonstrated a brutal efficiency in front of a largely horrified crowd of 21,644 at the Stadium of Light. 
 
Sergio Aguero started the ball rolling from the penalty spot before De Bruyne, Vito Mannone's own goal and Sterling made it 4-0 by the break to extend bottom-of-the-table Sunderland's first-half goals conceded tally for the season to 17 in just eight games and make Ola Toivonen's late header irrelevant. 
 
City boss Manuel Pellegrini made just three changes to the side beaten 2-1 at home by West Ham at the weekend - the club's second reverse inside five days - as Willy Caballero, Martin Demichelis and Fernando replaced Joe Hart, the injured Eliaquim Mangala and Fernandinho. 
 
As a result, his team was eye-wateringly strong for an early domestic cup-tie, but even the Chilean could not have dreamt what would happen during a remarkable opening 45 minutes. 
 
Sunderland had actually started the brighter when hapless full-back Patrick van Aanholt clumsily barged Jesus Navas to the ground as he carved his way into the penalty area and Aguero expertly dispatched the resulting 10th-minute spot-kick past goalkeeper Mannone, whose evening was to deteriorate much further. 
 
The Black Cats thought they were back in it within six minutes when Fabio Borini out-muscled Nicolas Otamendi and fired past Caballero, only for referee Roger East to rule that he had fouled the defender in the process, much to the ire of home fans still contesting City's penalty. 
   Promoted stories   
Sweden international Toivonen should have levelled with a 25th-minute header after meeting debutant DeAndre Yedlin's cross with a firm header, but he picked out Caballero. 
 
But once De Bruyne had embarrassed Mannone at his near post seconds later after exchanging passes with Sterling with 25 minutes gone, the game was heading only one way. 
 
The Italian was culpable once again as he could only push full-back Bacary Sagna's cross into Sterling's path, although he was unfortunate to see the midfielder's initial shot come back off the post and go in off his body. 
 
Sterling did not need the help of the woodwork nine minutes before the break when he beat Mannone comprehensively after being played in by De Bruyne, and had Aguero not tried to be too clever after rounding the keeper five minutes later and allowed Yedlin and Sebastian Coates to cover back, it would have been 5-0 at the break. 
   
 Share article  
   
City picked up where they had left off with Sterling passing up two opportunities to add to his tally within the opening five minutes of the second half, but Jeremain Lens tested Caballero with a well-struck 63rd-minute effort as the home side battled on gamely. 
 
Caballero blocked Borini's 73rd-minute shot with his legs after Yedlin had slid him in, but there was nothing he could do to prevent Toivonen from glancing a header past him from another Yedlin cross with seven minutes remaining.",31472719-740a-455e-8ceb-ab0edf9e6014,News,2015-09-22T21:34:39Z,Chelmsford Weekly News,Kevin de Bruyne and Raheem Sterling star as Manchester City crush Sunderland,0.0,News

Markets around the world are whipsawing back and forth, throwing asset prices all over the place. 

That doesn't have to be a bad thing, according to Luke Hickmore, a senior investment in fixed income at the $483.3 billion Aberdeen Asset Management. 

He told Business Insider that investors should ""look to the opportunity rather than just watching the screens."" 

Those, he said, could look ""messy"" for a while. 

Hickmore said we're going to have to get used to the market volatility, as investors try to gauge when the Federal Reserve will finally raise interest rates. That volatility throws up opportunities, however 

""For us this is great,"" he said. ""If you're investing medium- to long-term, you want the chance to buy the things you like at the price where you want to pay for them."" 

He explained that the extended period of low volatility meant assets moved in lockstep. One bond would trade much like another, regardless of the fundamental quality of the company that issued it. In a new environment, that could all change — and it means more choice for investors. 

""Things blow up on you and things get wider and choices come along that you didn't have before,"" Hickmore said. 

His advice for investors? 

""Use these times, plan what you want to do, think about where the quality is — where the value is — and wait for the time to get in, because volatile markets just give you the chance to do that.""

381,"Patients are experiencing unacceptable delays for cancer tests due to underfunded and overstretched services, according to two reports. 
 
Key waiting times targets are being missed, leading to anxiety for people waiting to hear if they have the disease, Cancer Research UK said. 
 
It points to growing pressure on services for imaging and endoscopy - a long, flexible tube that relays images of inside the body on to a TV screen. 
 
A report produced for the charity by the University of Birmingham predicts that more than 750,000 extra endoscopies will be needed every year in the UK by 2020. 
 
This is a 44% increase on current levels, and is fuelled by the growing number of people who will suffer a range of diseases, including cancer, as they age. 
 
A second study for the charity points to major concerns regarding NHS imaging, including an under-resourced workforce and outdated equipment. 
 
It said it will cost £215 million to replace old imaging equipment. 
 
Imaging services include CT scans, MRI and ultrasound and are key for diagnosing cancer and monitoring progression of the disease. 
 
Cancer Research UK argues there are too few staff working in testing, including a lack of nurse endoscopists and radiologists. 
 
Sara Hiom, director of early diagnosis at the charity, said: ""Waiting for tests and test results can be a worrying and uncertain time, and delays will only increase that anxiety. 
 
""Patients need to feel reassured that suspected cancer is being taken seriously and is prioritised by the NHS because we know early diagnosis and swift treatment are crucial in giving them the best possible chance of beating the disease."" 
 
She said the state of NHS diagnostic services was ""deeply concerning"" and new guidelines for GPs aimed at increasing diagnosis means more people will be waiting for tests. 
   Promoted stories   
""There aren't enough trained staff, they're often reliant on outdated equipment and in many cases they're already operating services seven days a week,"" she said. 
 
""GPs do not have the access they need and that means patients are waiting too long for tests. This has to change if doctors are to diagnose more people with cancer earlier, when treatment is more effective."" 
 
Latest NHS figures show that half of NHS trusts in England fail to meet the target for 85% of cancer patients to start treatment within 62 days of being urgently referred by a GP. 
 
Around 6,100 patients in the first quarter of 2015/16 were not seen within 62 days. 
 
The NHS is also only just meeting its target for 93% of patients with suspected cancer to be seen by a specialist within two weeks of referral by their GP (93.6% are seen). 
 
The Government's cancer strategy, published this summer, said that by 2020, 95% of patients referred for testing by a GP should be definitively diagnosed with cancer, or have cancer ruled out, within four weeks of referral.

50,"Scotland rugby players were greeted with music from school pupils and given tournament caps during their official welcome ceremony at Gloucester Cathedral this afternoon. 
 
The team will be based at Hartpury College for the next few days ahead of the start of their World Cup campaign at Kingsholm Stadium in Gloucester on Wednesday when they face Japan. 
 
The ceremony was a celebration of Scotland Rugby's achievements and included their friends and family as well as members of the local community. 
 
They arrived to a greeting from a choir from Isbourne Valley School performing official tournament anthem `World In Union` in front of an audience including figures from World Rugby, England Rugby 2015 and the Rugby Football Union. 
 
Paul James, leader of Gloucester City Council, presented the team with a special mini Scrumpty as a gift from the city. 
 
He said: ""It is an immense honour to welcome the Scotland Rugby team to the city and a huge privilege for Gloucester to be a host city for the third largest sporting event in the world."" 
 
Following welcome speeches from chairman of England Rugby 2015 Andrew Cosslett and Scotland manager Gavin Scott, each member of the team was presented with a Tournament cap and Rugby World Cup 2015 participation medal. 
 
There were four cap and medal bearers who were selected from local clubs and educational institutions, representing the legacy of Rugby World Cup 2015. 
 
Speaking during the ceremony, Scotland captain Greig Laidlaw who also plays for Gloucester Rugby, said: ""I am so proud to stand here as Scotland captain. It has been months, if not years, of hard work in preparing for this event. 
 
""To all the people of Gloucester it is great to be here. I joined the club just over a year ago and I have really enjoyed getting to know the city. 
 
""I have been explaining to the boys how much you love rugby and they could see it as we drove through the city. But I have one small plea. 
 
""Japan will be playing in cherry and white on Wednesday so for once please could you put that to one side. It would be much appreciated. 
 
""We look forward to seeing you all at Kingsholm on Wednesday."" 
 
The ceremony culminated with a beat-boxing performance by local act Duke. 
 
Gloucester Cathedral is among 17 landmark venues across England and Wales chosen to host Welcome Ceremonies. 
 
It is predicted to be the biggest boost for the UK's travel and tourism industry since the London Olympics three years ago, pumping almost £1billion into the economy during the next month and a half.",9b261fee-27b5-4bc8-b08d-6d16069e441b,News,2015-09-17T18:40:01Z,Punchline,City welcomes Scotland before Rugby World Cup kicks off tomorrow,0.0,News

90,"""It will always be somewhere that reminds her of what Lachlan did,"" says the actress 
        
A torn Alicia Metcalfe is to decide that her future lies in Portugal - and away from husband David, who opts to stay in Emmerdale. 
 
Alicia, whose memories of the village are tainted by her assault earlier this year at the hands of Lachlan White, will depart in emotional scenes to be shown next week. 
 
""There's a moment where Alicia says that she feels like a failure because she was once happy in Emmerdale and she's now let Lachlan beat her,"" says actress Natalie Anderson. ""She's disappointed in herself for not being stronger and I'm sad for her too. It was a place she loved very much, but at the moment it will always be somewhere that reminds her of what Lachlan did. But, down the line, who knows what might happen?"" 
 
So is there not even a small part of her that wants to stay? ""No, absolutely not. She misses her sister, but not everything else. They're also dealing with Val's death, which is bleak and upsetting, especially for Jacob. So it's become a dark place for her, whereas Portugal is lovely and sunny. Over there, she felt like she had a future again."" 
 
David has, of course, been preoccupied with looking out for his grieving dad Eric's welfare. But viewers - and Alicia - know that he would in fact do anything to stay in the village and not return overseas. And, in the end, it's only when David's mask slips that the whole truth comes out. 
 
""Alicia loves David deeply, but she's becoming frustrated with him because she wants him to have the courage to say that he never wanted to go to Portugal and doesn't want to go back,"" continues Anderson. ""She feels like he's using his dad as an excuse. She would have more respect for him if he just came out and said it. Then when he does, that stresses her out a lot."" 
       
As for Anderson, the storyline marks the end of her five years on the ITV soap. ""The fans have been so kind,"" she says. ""I've had lots of messages saying that they can't believe I'm leaving. Prior to the helicopter crash, there was a lot of speculation that Alicia would die. I've been overwhelmed by the support that the fans have shown both me and my on-screen family."" 
 
And who is she going to miss the most? ""Everyone! Obviously my girls - Roxy Shahidi, Fiona Wade and Gaynor Faye. I'll miss them deeply. But obviously my family as well. I'll miss them all.""

374,"The 20-year conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo has killed an estimated 5.4   million people since the 1990s — making it the deadliest since World War II — and armed attacks by different groups occur every week. Séverine Autesserre (SIPA‘00), a member of  Columbia's Arnold A. Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies and a political science professor at Barnard College , is an authority on international intervention, conflict   resolution, and Central Africa who has researched Congo and visited the nation often   since 2001. 
  
Q What is the scope of the conflict? 
   
The international and national wars started in 1996, but there was already extensive local   violence in the eastern part of the country from 1993 on. Millions of Congolese have died   and the country has remained one of the poorest in the world. Since its outbreak, the   conflict has destabilized most of Central Africa, including Congo’s immediate neighbors   Rwanda, Burundi, and Uganda. 
   
Q Have there been any peacebuilding efforts? 
   
Congo hosts the largest United Nations peacekeeping mission in the world, which  attempts to protect the Congolese population from various armed groups and maintain, or   enforce, a ceasefire. There are numerous donors, international organizations (such as the   African Union), and non-governmental agencies working in Congo, as well as plenty of   diplomats. All of these people organize international and national peace conferences, and   they try to help the Congolese state reform and train its army, modernize its bureaucracy,   and organize free and fair elections. 
   
Q Why haven’t those efforts worked? 
   
Violence in Congo is in large part driven by local conflicts that international peace efforts   have not properly helped address. And by local, I really mean at the level of the   individual, the family, the clan, the municipality, the community, the district, and   sometimes the ethnic group. For instance, there is a lot of competition over who can be   chief of a village or a territory under traditional law, who can control the distribution of   land and the exploitation of local mining sites. This often results in localized fighting, and   can escalate across a whole province and even at times into neighboring countries. 
 
International peacebuilders view local conflicts as “simply” the result of national and   international tensions, insufficient state authority, and what they view as the Congolese   people's “inherent penchant” for violence. So they consider intervention at the national   and international levels as their only option. As a result, there is very little international   support for local conflict resolution efforts in Congo. 
   
Q Is there an effective way to resolve conflict and build lasting peace? 
   
Because many conflicts have such local stakes, national and international peace   initiatives need to be supplemented with micro-level efforts. You cannot enact national   legislation or impose international law adjudicating who can be the appropriate chief of   each local village, or who among five parties in a conflict has legitimate ownership of a   piece of land. You need to look at these disputes on a case-by-base basis and find the   specific solution for each one. 
   
Q Are there signs that give you hope for peace there? 
   
Congolese elites and ordinary citizens have been engaged in bottom-up peace efforts   since the violence started more than 20 years ago, but they often lack the resources   required to be effective. Support from international donors can be crucial, and can lead to   the implementation of successful local peacebuilding initiatives. For instance, in the   provinces of the Kivus in eastern Congo, the Life and Peace Institute and its Congolese   partners have set up inter-community forums to discuss the specifics of local land   conflicts, and these forums have found solutions to help manage the violence. 
 
In the past few years, an increasing number of donors, international agencies, and non-  governmental organizations have starting paying more attention to resolving land   conflicts and promoting inter-community reconciliation – two issues that are absolutely   key for bottom-up peace. So there is hope that this will lead to concrete action in support   of Congolese local peacebuilders. 
 
This is the focus of my new research project, which examines how international   organizations can do a better job at supporting local actors and initiatives in   peacebuilding processes, particularly in Congo.",4394d354-4b39-4335-aece-077337a328ae,News,2015-09-16T16:02:14Z,Columbia University,5 Questions: Peacebuilding in Congo with Political Scientist Séverine Autesserre,0.0,News
1985,"While details have not yet emerged, it makes the ongoing situation at Stormont ever more serious. 
 
Three senior republicans were arrested on Wednesday morning in connection with the murder of Kevin McGuigan. 
 
Mr Robinson tweeted that his party will again seek the adjournment of the Assembly, after his previous bid to do failed. 
 
“These events were predicted in my statement on Monday,” the DUP leader said. 
 
“No one can be above the law. That is why we sought adjournment of the Assembly. We will do so again. Hopefully the UUP will support us this time rather than voting with SF for business as usual.” 
 
Crisis talks are due to resume at Stormont later without the Ulster Unionists, who walked out during Wednesday evening’s meeting. 
 
UUP leader Mike Nesbitt said his party would not discuss the Stormont House Agreement, which tackled legacy issues, until paramilitarism had been resolved. 
 
""This is the issue and the only issue that we will speak on,” he said. 
 
The DUP accused Mr Nesbitt of “hokey cokey politics”, while Sinn Féin claimed his “stunt politics” are part of an electoral battle within unionism. 
 
The UUP has withdrawn its one minister from the Executive and his replacement will be announced on 21 September. 
 
The power-sharing Executive has been under threat of collapse since police said IRA members were involved in the murder of Kevin McGuigan in east Belfast last month. 
 
The killings have overshadowed wider issues at Stormont, where divisions over the implementation of controversial welfare reforms have already plunged the devolved Assembly into financial peril. 
 
Going into the talks, Sinn Féin, which rejects the PSNI's assessment about the PIRA, said the party is keen to resolve all the issues at the heart of the crisis as part of the latest talks process. 
 
Secretary of State Theresa Villiers, who was hosting the talks with Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan, said the tone of the opening meeting was “genuinely constructive”.",8d798538-d285-40a0-a445-729c0a633305,News,2015-09-09T07:12:28Z,UTV,DUP puts ‘ultimatum’ to Villiers amid crisis,0.0,News

In 2010 Nicole Schneit aka Air Waves released Dungeon Dots, an album Aquarius Records called ""…pretty much perfect pop music."" For her new album Parting Glances, Schneit enlisted friends from Brooklyn's music community to contribute to the record, including members of Woods, Crystal Stilts, Ava Luna, and Hospitality. Additionally, Jana Hunter of Lower Dens contributes vocals to two songs. The album's title comes from the 1986 film Parting Glances in which Steve Buscemi portrays a gay man navigating the difficulties of being in a relationship in Reagan-era New York. More than just identifying with the story, Schneit is interested in the in the lasting effect of the parting glances we share with strangers in our everyday encounters. She explains ""You see all sorts of physical and emotional traits on the train. From people puking, making out, screaming, crying, laughing, dancing, grooming, etc. We encounter each other in the thick of our complex lives by simply looking at each other all the time. These glances are mundane and fleeting but also powerfully intimate."" The lingering impact of those brief moments seeps into the details and imagery she delivers with energizing hooks and a disarming lack of pretense on Parting Glances.

3906,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A U.S.-EU commercial data-sharing deal faces a major test on Wednesday when an adviser to the European Union's top court will say whether he believes it is still binding in light of allegations of mass U.S. spying. 

The case stems from a complaint filed by 27-year-old Austrian law student Max Schrems against Facebook with the Irish data protection commissioner, who monitors compliance with privacy laws. 

Schrems argued the company helped the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) harvest email and other private data from European citizens by forwarding data to servers in the United States and asked the Irish watchdog to investigate whether the United States was providing adequate data protection. 

The Irish regulator rejected the request on the grounds that it was bound by the EU Safe Harbour agreement of 2000 which allows companies to transfer EU citizens' data to the United States because it is held to have sufficient privacy safeguards in place. 

The Irish watchdog plays a central role because Facebook users in the EU enter an agreement with Facebook Ireland when they join the social network. 

Schrems, who still uses Facebook and says he wants to improve it, appealed the decision in October 2013. Irish High Court Justice Gerard Hogan subsequently asked the European Court of Justice (ECJ) if the Irish regulator was still bound to follow the Safe Harbour decision given ""gaping holes in contemporary U.S. data protection practice"" and whether it could or should conduct its own investigation in light of allegations of mass U.S. surveillance programmes. 

Safe Harbour, which simplifies the everyday business of some 4,000 companies, came under fire in 2013 after fugitive ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked details of a U.S. mass electronic surveillance programme, known as Prism. 

The leaks showed the NSA used major web companies, including Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft, to gather user data. 

Following the fallout the European Commission called for a review of the agreement and negotiations with Washington have been going on since January 2014. 

Wednesday's opinion to judges, who are expected to rule in a few months' time, comes at a delicate time for the renegotiation of Safe Harbour. 

""It could have an impact on the whole Safe Harbour system as a transfer solution,"" said Tanguy Van Overstraeten, a partner specialising in data protection at law firm Linklaters. 

ECJ Advocate General Yves Bot will deliver his opinion in Luxembourg on Wednesday at around 0930 CET (0730 GMT). While the court's judges are not bound by the opinion, they follow it in most cases. 

""If the judges come to the situation where Safe Harbour is not valid then it could be reopening the whole story and that, for many thousands of U.S. companies, would be very difficult because that could mean that in fact the basis of the transfer of data by them would be invalid,"" Van Overstraeten said. 

Facebook declined comment.

2983,"One of racing's great anomalies is how Gai Waterhouse hasn't managed to win a Golden Rose? One of racing's great anomalies is how Gai Waterhouse hasn't managed to win a Golden Rose? Granted, in racing terms the ink is barely dry on the group 1 sign-off - and the event itself is only a little over a decade old - but Tulloch Lodge have annexed five Golden Slippers in the same period.

However transitioning those autumn two-year-olds into an early spring three-year-old for Sydney's first major of the carnival seems to have flummoxed the trainer who gets it right more often than not.

Having lost Slipper hero Vancouver for the $1 million Golden Rose - and indeed the balance of the spring carnival - Waterhouse has hauled Speak Fondly, the only filly in the field and an also-ran in the Slipper, from her deep reserves to try to break the duck at Rosehill and hand Gooree Stud back-to-back wins in the race.

Cynics suggest her failure in the Slipper directly contributed to Vancouver's success, providing a three-wide trail for the colt to surge to victory under Tommy Berry.

But behind Speak Fondly in the Slipper was Golden Rose favourite Exosphere, whose excuse was a more than worthy one via cardiac arrhythmia.

Judging by his walloping of his Run To The Rose rivals when resuming as a three-year-old last start, $3 favouritism is worthy. The nagging doubt? Both his career failures have come on firm tracks - and a good (3) is tipped at Rosehill.

Still, there are cases for others. Speak Fondly ($4.60), brandishing the Waterhouse bone-and-muscle and third-up, should be able to dictate and needs only to see out the Rose's 1400-metre route to be in the finish.

With the services of fly-in Hong Kong-based Brett Prebble, who has won a Golden Slipper, a Melbourne Cup and an Australian Guineas doing so in the past few years, she has already been well backed.

Yet the only group 1 winner in the field, Press Statement ($3.60), looks the top play here. His return in the Run To The Rose was super, an extra 200m looks right up his alley and Tye Angland can stalk who he pleases from the good gate.

It might be worth saving on Gold Symphony ($21) at each-way odds, aided by a rails draw in a race where tactics will be all important.

The tempo might be far more genuine in the group 1 Makybe Diva Stakes at Flemington, where Australia's weight-for-age dearth has left a familiar cast.

Boban ($4.40) is back, Fawkner ($6) returns and Happy Trails ($12) - a Flemington specialist - keeps humming along, but what price for a couple of emerging stars to finally arrive on the scene?

Hi World and Volkstok'n'barrell (both $11) appeared likely after encouraging Memsie Stakes runs, but car park draws render their hopes better on a later day.

Owing to a badly-needed shake-up at the top level, the supremely talented Alpine Eagle ($7) goes on top. Without winning, you don't make much more impressive returns than his Adelaide effort and clockers have been enamoured with his recent work.

The Cox Plate beckons.

1580,"Jenson Button is confident his Formula One future will be resolved by the end of the month. 
 
		 
Speaking after the Italian Grand Prix a fortnight ago, Button was hopeful an announcement would be made ahead of this week's iconic night race in Singapore. 
  Jenson Button is hoping to have his future resolved soon   
Button signed a two-year contract with McLaren in December, but the British team have an option on whether to retain him for 2016 - a clause which is said to expire at the end of September. 

			 
Young McLaren charges Kevin Magnussen, not here in Singapore this weekend after falling off his bike and breaking his hand, and Stoffel Vandoorne, the runaway GP2 series leader, are waiting in the wings. 



 
But Button appears to be growing ever-optimistic that he will extend his evergreen grand prix career into a 17th campaign. 

""I said the next couple of weeks at the last race and I was wrong,"" Button said when asked about a time frame for an announcement. ""So, I think the next couple of weeks - by the end of the month definitely. 

""It is not frustrating at all but there is a lot that you have got to think about over that period of time. It is an important couple of weeks but I am in a good place."" 

Last year, Button's future was dragged out until the end of the season with McLaren not announcing their driver line-up until December. 

			 
But the 2009 world champion, who has ruled out a move to the newly-formed American outfit Haas, is confident a repeat scenario will be avoided this term. 

""It is a massive difference to last year and I think everyone has learnt from that being a bit of a mess,"" Button added. 

""I am very happy with what I have done this year and I think the team are as well. It is not what you may think."" 

Button has endured a testing season with McLaren as the British team's renewed relationship with Honda has failed to take off. But the 35-year-old is optimistic that their partnership with Honda will deliver the goods in the long term. 

			 
""If I am in F1 it will be with this team,"" he added. ""I have had some tough times with this team but I have a lot of respect for them and for Honda. 

""I think this team is for the future and I do not think there is any point looking at a smaller start-up programme. This team is very young still in terms of our relationship with Honda. This will improve a lot over the years, it just depends on how long.""

3850,"SAT scores for 2014 hit their lowest mark in the past 10 years, the College Board reports, leading some observers to fear that a decade of school reforms have amounted to little. But education experts of all political stripes downplay the significance of the SAT scores because they aren't a representative sample of American high school graduates. SAT test takers skew toward college-bound high schoolers, and that population also shifts over time and varies by geography, says William Mathis, managing director of the National Education Policy Center at the University of Colorado. Students on the coasts take the SAT, while those in the heartland are more likely to take the competing ACT exam. Even in SAT country, some states push most of their students to take the test, and some even pay the fees, while others let students do it all themselves. In general, the trend has been for more students to take the SAT, Mathis said, so it's not surprising that average scores come down. ""We are digging deeper into the pool,"" Mathis said, ""with huge numbers of traditionally non-test taking populations now taking the test, and not scoring as well, and bringing the average down."" ""You can't use the SAT to say anything,"" agrees Michael Petrilli, president of the Washington, D.C.-based Fordham Institute. ""We do know that the population taking the test has changed over time, and that more low-income kids are taking it."" The net result, Mathis, Petrilli and other experts agree, is that SAT scores tell us very little about the state of American education. Expert opinion begins to differ, however, when it comes to what we do know about the academic readiness of American high schoolers. Most of these experts agree we can learn more from the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The NAEP test is given every four years throughout the country to a random sample of fourth-, eighth- and 12th-graders. But they disagree on what even these numbers tell us. So have American high school students improved over the last decade, or are they stuck in a rut? And if the latter, what does their stagnation tell us about our vaunted education reform efforts that began in the late 1990s? The answers, as is so often the case in education, depend on who you ask. Lost momentum? Fordham's Petrilli, a vocal advocate of tougher standards and school accountability, agrees that stagnating SAT scores tell us little on their own, but he sees that same stagnation reflected in the NAEP scores over the past 10 years, and in recent ACT exam scores. NAEP scores matter most, though, because they are statistically valid, a random sampling of students in all states. Petrilli is particularly worried that what he sees as strong fourth- and eighth-grade growth in NAEP scores over the past decade seems to disappear in the 12th-grade NAEP tests. He sees two possible explanations for that decline: either what we are teaching kids in grade school does not translate well to high school so their improvement is illusory, or our high schools are dropping the ball. Page 2 of 3 - Petrilli acknowledges that the first argument may have merit, but puts his analytical bets on the second. High schools, he says, have not been a focus of the school reform movement, and have largely been allowed to plod along without disruption. Not everyone agrees that high schools are losing ground. Bob Schaeffer, public education director for the National Center on Fair and Open Testing, a Wasington-based education advocacy group, looks at the same NAEP data as Petrilli and sees a different story. In Schaeffer's interpretation, NAEP scores have been largely stagnant throughout the education reform period, both at the grade school and high school levels. If Schaeffer is right, then doubling down on education reform at the high school level would be just asking for more of a failed approach. ""The problem with education reformers is they are always looking for simple solutions to very complicated problems,"" Schaeffer said. ""The notion that there could be a quick fix in high school for poor test scores is another example of their simple-minded intervention strategy."" Achievement gaps The real challenge, Schaeffer argues, is that schools at all levels are being asked to bear the brunt of economic, social and familial stresses that interfere with learning that simply cannot be properly addressed by schools. The economic gaps in SAT scores remain enormous. Inside Higher Ed points to gaps in reading scores to illustrate the point, but the same pattern appears from every angle. On a scale of 800, the average SAT reading score for students with a family income below $20,000 was 433, or the 28th percentile, while the average for those above $200,000 was 570, or the 72nd percentile. One of the most startling data points is the growth or decline of SAT scores by ethnic groups from 2006 to 2013. The National Center for Fair and Open Testing found that all ethnic groups except Asians suffered some decline. Asian scores climbed 54 percent over that period, while white scores declined slightly and all other ethnic groups declined in double digits. ""The single best predictors of academic success are the family's socio-economic status, the job status of the parents, and the education level of the mother,"" Schaeffer said, adding that most research shows that only 20 and 30 percent of academic outcomes can be influenced by the school. The test score gaps are influenced partly by economic and social stress, and partly by the enrichment wealthier families offer their children, says David Berliner, an emeritus education professor at Arizona State University. Over the past decade, Berliner said, enrichment opportunities offered by wealtheir parents — ranging from after-school art programs to test prep and tutoring — have increased fivefold among wealthier families while remaining flat in the middle and lower class. Unpacking NAEP Page 3 of 3 - Berliner argues that the NAEP scores can teach us a lot, but people generally don't use them correctly. The beauty of the NAEP scores, he argues, is not just that they are statistically valid, but also that we get 51 comparison points: each state plus the District of Columbia. The U.S. as a whole may trail South Korea on the national test score comparisons, he argues, but Massachusetts does not. ""We have 51 systems,"" Berliner said, ""and some are doing better, and some are doing worse, and this is true even of states that are right next to each other and similar in most other ways."" He notes that Utah's schools are outperforming Arizona's, despite spending far less per pupil, and that Massachusetts has outstripped its neighbors in school performance in recent years, including neighboring Connecticut and Vermont. ""We need to learn from these differences,"" Berliner says. ""What are these states doing differently?""",4dd4f772-69e2-4089-8bb6-d39c87ea865c,News,2015-09-16T12:16:18Z,Ag Journal,"Why you shouldn't care that SAT scores are stagnating, and what they don't mean about American education",0.0,News

2364,"The new iPhones arrived in force and already a sales success story, showing that Apple returned to hit full on their formula for success. However, and beyond these figures, there have been some problems with these new equipment. The latest is associated with a bug in iOS 9 and allocating the motion sensors of the iPhone 6s. This problem is affecting only new iPhones 6S and was discovered by those who try to use applications that use the sensors of the new M9 motion co-processor. This happened to be now included in the SoC A9 processor from Apple and serves as the interface between the operating system and the different sensors that equip the iPhone 6S. The problem is reflected in the inability to use applications that make use of data from the various motion sensors, and in particular InvenSense gyro six axes and the accelerometer Bosch Sensortec three axes. When sensors that these are intended to be used fail to transpose the data and applications are left with strange behavior, making it impossible to use. The problem is, for now, contained the new iPhone models and appear to affect only third-party applications that try to use these sensors. Any of the Apple applications that make use of these sensors, such as maps, do not have these problems and also older iPhone models do not seem to be affected for the problem. The problem was first discovered in the application Sky Guide, which uses these sensors to display on the iPhone screen a map of the stars that adjusts according to the user’s movement. The team that developed this application addresses the problem to an implementation with failures iOS API 9th Gathering M9 coprocessor information. This team is also trying to find a solution to this problem, returning the possibility of using the Sky Guide in the new iPhones. But it’s not just this application that is experiencing this problem. Several programmers, responsible for other similar and that make use of the iPhone motion sensors applications are to complain of it. From what has been possible to ascertain, this is not an exclusive problem of the iOS 9 and even the latest version, 1.9, is showing the same behavior. It is also the first time that this problem arises in iPhones. Already in 2013, at the launch of iPhone 5s, there was a similar situation at the time was attributed to lack of calibration of the new accelerometer Bosch now being used. So far, and how is normal in these situations, Apple has not yet issued any comments or additional information about the problem. It is expected very soon news that should come in the form of an update to iOS and that should correct the problem.",3f9a848a-f602-437f-9d3d-594695490a3c,Blog,2015-09-29T07:49:29Z,Information Technology Current News,Failure iOS 9 commits motion sensors of the iPhone 6s – Pplware,1.0,Blog

1839,"Google today announced the arrival of Street View in Sharjah and Ajman, a feature by Google Maps that will allow users to view and navigate 360 degree street-level imagery of major streets across the two Emirates. 
 

 
The first Street View Special Collect in the UAE was launched in 2013 for Burj Khalifa followed by the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Center and the Liwa desert in Abu Dhabi. In 2014, Dubai was the first Arab city to have Street View on a street level. 
 
  
 
Google Street View imagery provides users with a rich, immersive browsing experience and allows users to explore world landmarks, view natural wonders, navigate a trip or other points of interest. Street View was first launched in May 2007 and is already available in more than 3000 cities across 63 countries around the world. 
 

 
Some of the special areas captured by Street View are Al Noor Mosque, the Khor Fakkan and Kalba enclaves on the East, the Al Tamal camel track and the Al-Murabaa Watchtower on the Corniche. The Trekker equipment gathered imagery of the Al Majaz Waterfront and the Al Qasba with its “Eye of the Emirates”  ferris wheel. The Trekker equipment  is a wearable Street View backpack with a camera system on top that is designed to go down footpaths, tracks and narrow pathways to get images of areas of natural beauty or tourist sites.   
 
  
 
The Street View car covered the following streets in Sharjah: Al Khan, Al Wahda and Corniche Street – and the following streets in Ajman: Al Muntazah Street, Sheikh Rashid Bin Humeed, Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed and Sheikh Ammar Bin Humaid street.   
 

 
The Google street also returned to Sheikh Zayed road to update its imagery since its initial capture last year.   Antony McLoughlin, Street View Program Manager, for Google in Europe, Middle East and North Africa, said: 
 
“We have been expanding Street View across the UAE and hope to do add additional imagery in the future. Street View is a great feature that benefits users and businesses, we’ve received great feedback wherever we’ve launched around the world.” 
 
  
 
Street View Process   
 
Street View imagery is gathered by a vehicle equipped with advanced imaging technology— a camera mounted on the roof of a car that collects imagery and location data. After collection, the imagery is stitched together to create the 360° panoramic images that allows you to move around and explore locations as if you were there.   
 

 
Google is constantly improving its maps with tens of thousands of updates everyday throughout the world – from the latest road names, business addresses to public transit schedules and photos. Street View  provides easily accessible tools for flagging inappropriate or sensitive imagery for review and removal. Each image contains a link to a “Report a problem” tool where users can report objectionable images.

4192,"The crazy, true-life adventures of Norway's most radical billionaire: 
Shawn Tully on Norwegian billionaire Fred Olsen:
His presence galvanized and terrified employees in equal measure. Each morning he’d race into the parking lot in a secondhand Oldsmobile 98 sedan, then sprint upstairs to his office. “It was like he never slept,” says one former employee. “He could be really rough when he was mad about something. He could shame you. But you knew why, and you knew you’d screwed up. If you were as passionate as he was, he loved you, but if not, you were gone.” In quieter moments Olsen would regale employees about the lost city of Atlantis or Heyerdahl’s discoveries. They called such sessions “going to the moon.”

The precursor to “moonshots”?
Although former associates say Olsen is a brutally tough businessman, in our discussions he never mentioned profits and rarely cited numbers when talking about his latest investments. For Olsen, renewable energy is more an ethical calling than a business imperative. His long experience in petroleum production convinces him that the world isn’t facing a shortage of oil or even a future of ultrahigh prices. But renewables are essential, he says, to counter global warming. “If this warming continues, the oceans will rise, and the place we’re sitting now, and many cities, will be under water,” says Olsen, who drives a Tesla Model S. His principal crusade is protecting the Arctic from the drilling and shipping traffic that fracture the polar icecap. “I used to fly over the North Pole, and all you saw was thick, white ice, cracked like the surface of an old painting,” he says. “Now you see lots of black water, and that accelerates the heating of the oceans.”

Maybe the last guy you’d expect to take up such a cause, and he truly champions it. 
Back in his office, Olsen is reflecting on his long career, in which change has been just about the only constant. “Both products and family businesses obey life cycles,” he says. “My mother’s family was in fishhooks and horseshoe nails. Those businesses came and went. That’s why it’s so important to catch the wave, to keep innovating, keep changing.” In Olsen’s case, that’s been the blueprint for a most interesting life. 

Great advice. Also look for the part where Fortune debunks the notion that Olsen was the inspiration and model for C. Montgomery Burns – to which Olsen responds, “I’m thankful!”",35a5ae88-d671-4843-908e-6d412bd7e539,Blog,2015-09-29T19:47:01Z,ParisLemon,"The crazy, true-life adventures of Norway's most radical billionaire",1.0,Blog

4769,"Mae ...
Today Mae proudly walked 5km for her sister Phoebe and all of the kids at St.Jude. She raised close to $1500 by making and selling rainbow loom bracelets. We are very proud of her. 
Mae was just 23 months when her baby sister was diagnosed with cancer and like Phoebe, she has grown up and experienced many firsts and milestones in the hospital. 
Despite the struggles and heartache that has shaped her life, Mae shines. She is like a breath of fresh air and although she is only 6 years old, she is wise beyond her years. If you ask her, she will tell you everything you ever wanted to know about the immune system, blood, children's hospitals and her sister Phoebe. 
This year has been so hard. It has been by far the most difficult despite everything we had already been through. Mae has been witness to too many traumatizing and devastating things. She has sat quietly as doctors have discussed infections, strokes, seizures, cancer, and terrible odds. She has seen her baby sister scream in pain. She has walked beside us the many times Phoebe has been transferred to the ICU. She has seen Jon and I completely broken. She has asked if Phoebe will ever come home. She has watched as Phoebe is sedated. She has wondered out loud if the Phoebe that she loves so much would come back to her after a stroke and fungal infection in the brain caused her to be unrecognizable. She has sat by and held her little sister's hand through days that would cause the strongest people to completely break down. Despite a fungal infection that has left marks and scars on Phoebe's skin that are most likely permanent - Mae sees nothing but pure beautiful and brave Phoebe. Unlike some adults who have asked, ""what is wrong with your baby"", Mae chooses kindness and focuses on what is important. 
Mae talks about her dreams - she too dreams of cancer and of Phoebe. She says that ""the guys with swords are the bad guys, but then there are good guys with shields and they are protecting Phoebe"". I hope the good guys win, she says. 
She worries about Phoebe and has asked me the most heartbreaking things these past few months. Words that I can't bring myself to write down because it makes all of this even more real and heartbreaking. Questions about life and death and heaven. No six year old should dream of cancer and wonder where her friends have gone and if they are hurting. 
Throughout all of this heartache and trauma, time and time again, Mae chooses hope.
She has helped Phoebe learn to walk again after strokes and too much time in the hospital. She is the first to cheer her sister on as she tries something new. She has patiently waited for Phoebe to be well enough to play. Time and time again. She will do anything and everything for Phoebe and she knows that she helps Phoebe to heal and thrive. Despite many opportunities to go home - Mae chooses to stay in Memphis, ""because Phoebe needs me"". 
I have never seen love like the love that Mae has for her sister. It breaks my heart and fills me with pride all at the same time. 
September is childhood cancer awareness month - and a childhood cancer diagnosis affects the entire family. Siblings, like our sweet Mae, are often the unsung but very brave heroes. ",d3bb7220-e4fe-4deb-af54-beadc650842a,Blog,2015-09-26T22:44:58Z,Phoebe Rose Rocks,Mae,1.0,News

2467,"BATON ROUGE — LSU is seeking to end its deal with the private manager of its Shreveport and Monroe hospitals, two years after hospital operations were turned over to a research foundation as part of Gov. Bobby Jindal's effort to privatize the state's charity hospital system. The university system sent formal notice Thursday to the Biomedical Research Foundation of Northwest Louisiana, or BRF, that it considers the hospital manager in breach of its contract. It gave the foundation until Oct. 5 to withdraw as hospital operator. ""We have exhausted all avenues to resolve our differences amicably and now must take action that we hoped would not be necessary,"" LSU System President F. King Alexander said in a statement. In a July letter to the research foundation, Alexander said BRF had not established a sustainable financial model for the hospitals, had damaged the LSU Shreveport medical school's reputation and threatened the stability of both the medical school and the hospitals. Foundation leaders deny any mismanagement and say they have followed the contract's terms. They've said LSU has thwarted efforts to ease the transition and remedy concerns. The foundation didn't immediately respond Thursday to the breach of contract letter. It wasn't clear who would operate the hospitals if BRF agrees to remove its management. The university system said a group of ""civic leaders"" will help manage the hospital until LSU finds a new operator to replace the foundation, but didn't name any of the people involved. Alexander said the hospitals will continue normal operations during the transition. BRF took control of the two north Louisiana hospitals in October 2013 through a no-bid contract, part of Jindal's push to privatize most of the university-run public hospital system that cares for the uninsured and provides much of the state's medical student training. Privatization of the hospitals in Shreveport and Monroe was in contrast to the approach the Jindal administration took in south Louisiana, where LSU's facilities are being overseen by companies that run other private hospitals in the area. Created in 1986 to boost regional economic development, BRF had more limited resources and no background in hospital management. It had never previously run a patient care facility.

Kiev, Sep 22: Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko today told the country’s security council that staying out of the NATO alliance was a “criminal” policy that his government is ready to reverse. More than 8,000 people have died in Ukraine’s fight against separatist rebels in the east since April 2014. Russia backed the rebels, fearing that the pro-Western course of the new Kiev government would make it a NATO ally. 

“The decision on the non-alliance policy which was announced by the previous government is criminal in terms of security and strategic interests of our state,” Poroshenko said, citing an opinion poll showing 60 per cent of Ukrainians supporting potential NATO membership. (Also Read: Burkina president Michel Kafando sceptical about proposed post-coup deal) 

Poroshenko, who chaired the security council with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in attendance, said any decision to join the alliance will be subject to a popular vote. Before the February 2014 uprising which toppled pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, the majority of Ukrainians opposed joining NATO, but many now see the alliance as their best defense from a foreign military threat. NATO officials say Ukraine needs to enact political, economic, social and military reforms to be considered for membership.

3588,"CHARLESTON, SC (WCSC) - 

The Burke High School football team prepared for kickoff Friday night under the lights at Johnson Hagood Stadium, which stands directly across the street from Stoney Field, their home stadium.

Wednesday, community members rallied to keep the Bulldogs' game downtown, despite poor field conditions at Stoney Field, which school officials deemed unsafe to play on.

Burke was initially scheduled to play Friday's game at Ravenel Stadium, on the old St. Andrew's High School campus in West Ashley.

""We want action. Action speaks louder than words and we've been waiting too long,"" Rep. Wendell Gilliard said.

In a 2011 land agreement between the City of Charleston, and Charleston County School District, the deal called for CCSD to renovate the field, using more than $2 million dollars owed the City, instead putting it towards that project. That money would come from the district's capital cycle between 2016-2021.

To date, renovations have not begun.

""The big issue here is not to save Stoney Field, but to build what we need,"" retired Burke football coach Earl Brown said. Brown led the football team on Stoney Field for nearly 30 years.

Built in the early 1960's, the field suffered major damage after Hurricane Hugo, and has been renovated 14 times. For the second time this season, conditions on the field have been ruled unsafe to play because of soggy ground, that's also sinking.

""Well, it was built on a garbage dump,"" retired Army Sgt. Herman Allen said. Allen served on a committee to maintain Stoney Field, which included getting it ready for game day. ""It was revealed that it was a mutual agreement between the city and the school district.""

Eight years later, Allen still holds a copy of plans from 2007 to renovate the stadium.

""Well that never transpired,"" he said. ""I would love to see that individual that took that two million dollars and stuck in their pocket and went home, because it didn't go to Stoney Field.""

Attempts to get a response from the school district have been unsuccessful. 

Gilliard has called a meeting with city leaders on Sept. 25 on the issue.",abbac11f-2a07-4f29-8b4d-a38d09c10a0c,News,2015-09-18T22:51:00Z,WSFA,"Despite agreement, questions remain about Stoney Field renovation plans",0.0,Blog

To say that Birminghamians harbor an insatiable appetite for Greek food would be an understatement. Consider this: during the upcoming three-day Greek Festival diners will scoff down some 12,000 pieces of chicken, 9,000 grape leaves, 5,000 pounds of Greek rice, 22,000 pieces of baklava and 12,000 servings of Greek lasagna (pastichio). Wow! That's a whole lot of eating! 

Hosted by members of Holy Trinity-Holy Cross Greek Orthodox Cathedral Church, the festival has been described as ""an act of love of Birmingham's Greek community going back to four generations."" 
 
The love will be well received when some 20,000 people turn out to hear Greek music, witness Greek dance performances and savor tempting Greek dishes prepared from recipes handed down for generations.

531,"A British amateur sailor has died after being hit by a sail while competing in a yacht race. 
 
Andrew Ashman, 49, was less than a week into the year-long Clipper Round the World Yacht Race when he was struck unconscious while sailing off the coat of Portugal. 
 
Veteran sailor and Clipper race founder Sir Robin Knox-Johnston paid tribute to Mr Ashman, who worked for many years as a London Ambulance paramedic. 
 
Sir Robin, the first person to sail non-stop single-handedly around the world, said: ""This is extremely sad news and my heart goes out to his bereaved family and friends, and to his fellow crew who have come to know Andrew with great affection during his training and the early days of this race. 
 
""Safety is always our utmost priority, as our record shows, and we shall investigate the incident immediately in full co-operation with the authorities."" 
 
Mr Ashman, an ""experienced yachtsman"" from Orpington, Kent, was adjusting the sail of his team's boat just after midnight last night when he was knocked unconscious by the sail and possibly the boom, race organisers said. 
 
He was given immediate medical assistance and attempts were made to resuscitate him, but he never regained consciousness and died in the early hours of this morning.

A spokesman for race organisers Clipper Ventures said: ""At this stage it looks like a tragic accident as far as we can see, but obviously there will be a full assessment. 
 
""The skipper and crew have been very upset."" 
 
His boat, sponsored by South African firm IchorCoal, had been sailing around 120 nautical miles off the Portuguese coast heading towards Brazil in the first leg of the race. 
 
Mr Ashman's boat, known as CV21, was part of a fleet which set sail from Tower Bridge last Sunday for the year-long race.

3047,"LAKE FOREST, Ill. -- The Chicago Bears never touched Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers in the season opener -- at least the statistics say this. 
 
So preparing to face the Arizona Cardinals and the play-action deep passing threat posed by quarterback Carson Palmer becomes a matter of finishing the pass rush and finding big-play makers. 

""I think we're capable and this is a different matchup, different style of offense,"" Bears coach John Fox said. 

Whether the Bears actually laid a hand on Rodgers is not as important as whether they achieved steady pressure. They did apply heat early, then faded away. They're one of only seven NFL teams that failed to record a sack in Week 1. 

In facing Palmer, they'll see a less mobile passer and one who will stay in the pocket longer to deliver downfield. He'll also give them more of a chance to complete the rush because Rodgers has an uncanny knack for dancing out of the pocket to deliver a big throw. 

""Obviously the most improvement we can make is just improving our pass rush and winning our one on one battles a little bit more than we did,"" defensive coordinator Vic Fangio said. ""I thought we competed well, we executed the defense, you didn't see people running free and were obvious errors to the naked eye, to anybody. We were there."" 

Fangio avoided laying blame on cornerback Alan Ball for getting beat by James Jones for a touchdown, or for the other two Rodgers touchdown passes. 

""They were just a little bit better than us at the 50-50 balls in the air and they blocked us better in pass rush,"" Fangio said. ""They have to cover a little bit better and we have to help them with a little bit better pass rush. It wasn't good enough, but I was disappointed in the play but by no means discouraged."" 

The pass rush did force Rodgers into scrambling eight times and he got out of the pocket a few more times. Still, the Packers had to accept shorter completions most of the day and had no completions of 40 yards and four longer than 20. 

""A big part of pass defense is the pass rush, and we've got to do a better job of getting some heat on the quarterback,"" Fangio said. 

Pernell McPhee signed for $40 million over five years and had no sacks. And now McPhee is an injury concern after practicing on a limited basis due to a wrist injury Wednesday. 

In his debut as a stand-up rusher, Jared Allen was left talking Wednesday about how much he liked when he played out of a three-point stance. He does have the option in some cases of rushing out of a three-point stance. 

""I like the flexibility, I really do,"" Allen said. ""There's nothing better than having your hand in the ground and getting after it."" 

Defensive play makers have to develop out of the scheme on their own, and Allen said the goal is to become strong enough they can be relied on at game's end. 

""We want it to be on our shoulders,"" he said. ""I want this defense to be established and to put us on the field at the end of games. That's what I hope it is and I hope it doesn't take a long time. 

""Really it shouldn't."" 

SERIES HISTORY: 92nd regular-season meeting. Bears lead series 58-27-6. The Bears own a 37-11-5 advantage in home games. That doesn't include games played at Wrigley Field from 1930-37 when the Chicago Cardinals were the home team.

Here are the top six times she has raised the temperature in the studio.

Susanna got the giggles when she sat down with the Prime Minister for an interview at his home in March. While asking questions about parents’ evenings and family life in Number 10, she nibbled the end of her pen and laughed, while displaying her legs in a short blue dress. 
 2. Luke Evans  [embedded content] 
Susanna’s flirty encounter with Dracula Untold star Luke Evans in October last year ended with the actor nibbling her neck. 
 
She asked the actor: “What is it like when you go in for the big bite?” and suggested: “Shall we do it?” 
 
Luckily Luke was game and flashed: “You’ve got to show me your neck first, though,” before jokingly nuzzling in. “That was quite nice, actually,” Susanna finished. 
 3. Jeremy Renner  [embedded content] 
Susanna left Avengers star Jeremy Renner looking embarrassed when she praised his physique on the GMB sofa. 
 
When asked about whether he’d be taking part in charity football match Soccer Aid earlier this year, Jeremy replied: “I’d always be honoured to go do that but I’d have to get in better shape.”

Susanna quickly replied: “You look in pretty good shape by the way. You look in great shape.”

LOS ANGELES: The National Football League season kicking off Thursday will unleash a flood of wagering in which $95 billion will be bet, most of it illegally, the American Gaming Association said on Wednesday (Thursday in Manila). 
 
“Illegal sports betting is reaching new heights of popularity in America,” Geoff Freeman, president and chief executive of the Washington-based trade group said in a press release. “It’s clear that a federal ban on traditional sports betting outside of Nevada is failing.” 
 
The AGA reckons that nearly $93 billon in illegal bets will be taken on NFL and college gridiron games this season, with slightly less than $2 billion wagered at legal sports books in Nevada. 
 
According to the AGA, Americans made $3.8 billion worth of illicit bets on the Super Bowl alone last season. 
 
“It’s clear that it’s a very popular activity that’s only growing in popularity,” Chris Moyer of the AGA told AFP. “It’s become an American pastime in many regards.” 
 
Nevada, best known for the glittering gambling haven of Las Vegas, is currently the only state legally offering a full menu of sports betting, with some limited legalized sports wagering also offered in a handful of other states. 
 
Not surprisingly, other states want to get in on the potentially lucrative action, with New Jersey in the midst of a four-year, multi-million-dollar court battle to allow such betting after residents voted for it in 2011. 
 
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie’s administration this week filed a motion for the full US Third Circuit Court of Appeals to hear the case, two weeks after a three-judge third circuit court panel ruled against the state. 
 
The NFL, NBA, NHL and MLB have all opposed New Jersey’s efforts, telling the court the proposed legislation threatens the integrity of their games and violates a 1992 federal ban on sports betting in most states. 
 
But NBA commissioner Adam Silver has said that the growth of legalized sports betting in the United states is “inevitable” and has called on the US Congress to create a federal law that would allow states to offer sports betting. 
 
The NBA wants to see a “federal legislative solution that would protect the integrity of the game while allowing those who engage in sports betting to do so in a legal manner,” NBA spokesman Mike Bass said in a statement after New Jersey’s latest court setback. 
 
Moyer said the AGA, through its Illegal Gambling Advisory Board, formed in June, is studying how legal sports betting might best be introduced in the United States and whether federal laws or individual state statues would best govern it. 
 
Officially, the NFL, baseball and the powerful NCAA that governs big-money collegiate sports remain opposed to wider legalization of sports betting. 
 
But baseball’s commissioner is open to discussing changing that position, and all the major US sports leagues now have sponsorship deals with “daily fantasy sports” companies that allow fans to wager money on made-up teams they create with players from different real-life teams.

996,"IT had been the beating heart of Nelson Bay for more than 50 years, a place some gathered for a hit and others flocked to for after-dark shenanigans. IT had been the beating heart of Nelson Bay for more than 50 years, a place some gathered for a hit and others flocked to for after-dark shenanigans. And even as the smoke continued to billow out of Nelson Bay Golf Club on Sunday, its current custodians vowed to return bigger and better.

‘‘This is more than a golf club, it is a huge part of the community,’’ president Max Pride said.

‘‘It is the hub of a lot of people’s lives. It is devastating but we will get through it.’’

An early morning fire, believed to have started in the roof cavity, quickly spread to destroy the majority of the club. A huge verandah and the club’s pro-shop underneath may remain standing, but most of the building will need to be levelled and rebuilt.

The club’s 35 employees, as well as possibly a couple of dozen who work in the restaurant Blue Water Grill, are now without work.

Restaurant proprietor Will Semmens said the place was booked out for Father’s Day lunches and dinners.

Wedding receptions, sporting club presentation nights and other functions have also been affected.

The golf course was not damaged, and Mr Pride said it may reopen within days once a portable clubhouse is organised.

‘‘There is no impact on the golf course itself except for the fact that we can’t process green fees and the like,’’ he said.

The club was originally built in 1963, with multiple additions as the Tomaree peninsula grew and took the club with it.

It has about 3500 current members, including about 1500 playing members.

Social media was inundated with messages of sympathy.

Fire crews were first called about 12.30am but it was too late to save the club.

Firefighters were forced to withdraw from inside the club as the flames shot through the roof cavity, collapsing large sections onto what was once the club’s bar, auditorium, office and poker machine areas.

Crews remained at the scene for most of Sunday to help extinguish spot fires which flared up.

Some golfers who turned up for a spring round had been unaware of the fire and were turned away.

Fire investigators were looking into the source of the blaze, although early indications were that it began in the roof and quickly spread.

There were no immediate reports on casualties, and the rebels said in a statement that the AMISOM troops had fled the base, situated in Janale district, 80 kilometres (50 miles) southwest of Mogadishu in the lower Shabele region. 
 
The base is thought to be manned by Burundian soldiers. 
 
“There was heavy explosion and fighting broke out at the AMISOM base in Janale. We don’t have details but we are hearing that Al-Shebab militants attacked the base,” said Mohamed Shire, a Somali military commander based in the region. 
 
A local eyewitness said Shebab fighters stormed into the base. 
 
“Heavy fighting broke out after a suicide bomber rammed his vehicle into the camp,” said local resident Ali Moalim Yusuf. “I saw heavily armed fighters chanting ‘Allahu Akbar’ (‘God is greatest’) pouring into the base.” 
 
The militants, who are fighting to overthrow Somalia’s internationally-backed and AU-protected government, confirmed they were behind the attack. 
 
“Mujaheddin fighters captured the base after a suicide bomber struck it, the enemy fled,” the Islamists said in a brief statement. 
 
In June, Shebab fighters killed dozens of Burundian soldiers when they overran an AMISOM outpost northwest of the capital. The militants also stage frequent suicide attacks inside the capital. 
 
But AMISOM, the 22,000-strong AU force in Somalia, has also made key gains against the Shebab in recent months, pushing them out of several strongholds in the southwest of the country.

3104,"Leeds United’s Under-18s turned on the style by hitting an incredible nine goals in a spectacular rout of Queens Park Rangers on Saturday. 

		 
A four-goal haul from Chapeltown youngster Mallik Wilks maintained the Under-18s’ impressive start to the season under new coach John Anderson. 

Wilks, who joined Leeds on scholarship terms this summer and has already scored eight times, dominated a one-sided clash between Leeds and QPR at Thorp Arch. 

			 
Wing-back Tom Pearce claimed two goals and Mike Taylor, Clarke Oduor and Lewis Knight weighed in with finishes to round off an eye-catching 9-2 victory. 



 
United’s Under-18s are in new hands this season following Anderson’s appointment to the academy coaching staff. 

The former Hull City and Bristol Rovers defender came to Leeds from Hull’s academy and has been given sole control of Leeds’ Under-18s. 

Jason Blunt, who was originally expected to manage that squad alongside Anderson, is currently assisting new academy director Paul Hart in coaching United’s development squad. Leeds’ Under-18s have won six of their open seven matches, suffering a solitary blip in a 2-0 defeat to Crystal Palace two weeks ago and sit at the top of their professional development league. 

Peterborough’s new manager Graham Westley has told the club’s fans to judge him on how his team plays following some negative reaction to his appointment. 

			 
The 47-year-old’s spell at Preston was overshadowed by reports of player unrest and criticism of both his management and playing style before he was sacked just over a year in charge and Posh fans have also raised concerns. 

He said: “It’s actions, not words that are going to inspire people. Whatever cynicism or scepticism there is, they’re going to watch the team and they’re going to see the confidence and energy and organisation, the verve and the drive that the team is going to play with. And it’s that they’ll ultimately judge me on.”

848,"Sonoran Hot Dog – bacon wrapped, 8-inch Mad Mike’s hot dog, covered in refried beans, homemade guacamole, fresh pico de gallo and drizzled with sour cream. Ashley Ludwig photo.   
There is a new name in gourmet hot dogs in Temecula, and a new attitude behind your neighborhood hangout. South Temecula has many things, but corner hangouts for after a sports game, a beer softball league, or a place for teams to host their latest fundraiser are in short supply. 
 
Enter Suzette Swanger, mother and Temecula resident, who saw a restaurant in crisis and stepped in to take it to the next level. 
 
“We purchased Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs over five months ago,” Swanger said, “and it’s been a heck of a ride since.”

This hot dog shop has changed hands a few times, but Swanger has that special something to make sure that all who enter to try Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs will return again, with friends and family in tow. 
 
Inside, it’s like being invited to a family barbecue – complete with checked table cloths, mountains of napkins for the juicy dogs and sandwiches and ample supplies of squeezable mustard and ketchup. A jukebox on the wall plays fun, classic or recent hip tunes, depending on the crowd. Regulars hang out at the bar. Families at the tables, ordering hand dipped sweet corn dogs or baskets of homemade potato chips. 
 
Remember, when you come in to Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs, bring the family and prepare to mind your manners during the big game. 
 
“We initiated a ‘Bad Word Box’ for anyone caught swearing at the bar when kids are present,” Swanger said, thumbing through the stack of bills. “It’s a relatively new idea and fun for those in the know. At the end of the month we plan on donating the funds raised to a local charity.” 
 
Behind the bar, tap handles range from backyard barbecue cheap beer – Pabst Blue Ribbon – that will more than likely always remain on tap, according to Swanger, to featured craft brew, such as the Petaluma based brewer Lagunitas IPA. Regionally famous for their India Pale Ale, this well balanced beer is now featured at Devil Dogs. With caramel malt barley to mellow the hop flavors, Lagunitas is one for beer lovers to try. 
 
“I love having friends over, cooking and entertaining. Devil Dogs has become a natural extension of that,” she said.

Lunch time at this hot dog shop finds locals at the many tables or hanging out at the comfortable bar seating. TVs have multiple games on, showcasing college football on a September morning. The menu is chock full of gourmet hot dogs, such as the bacon wrapped Sonoran Dog, or the Portuguese Hawaiian Sausage, with spicy Mad Mike’s sausage combined with sweet pineapple flavors. Of course, fans can build their own hot dog or sausage creations with the ever growing list of toppings. 
 
“Last week, we added mushrooms to our list,” Swanger said. “It’s always fun to see just how high people can top their hot dogs or sausages.” 
 
Along with the multiple specialty dogs and sandwiches, Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs also makes their own hand-cut French fries, onion rings, and homemade potato chips. 
 
“We consider ourselves farm to table here, even though our farm is in Arizona,” she said. “Everything is homemade here in the shop.” 
 
 Hand Dipped Corn Dogs are sweet and crunchy, “like we get at the fair!” as one child described the tasty offering. Shown over a bed of hand cut fries and homemade potato chips, Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs can turn anything on their gourmet menu into a corn dog. Ashley Ludwig photo.   
Side dishes for the gourmet offerings are just as one would expect from a corner hot dog shop, with the added benefit of Swanger’s special touch. 
 
The coleslaw is her family recipe, not creamy but sliced thin, crisp cabbage and poppy seeds made in small batches and tossed in an apple cider vinaigrette. This slaw complements the perfectly prepared hotdogs and sausages. Her potato salad, in a nod to deviled eggs, has a kick and just the right balance of sweet, salt, and heat with the addition of paprika and pimento. 
 
Bringing Mad Mike’s Sausages into the mix was a natural choice for Swanger, making gourmet hot dogs the order of the day. From mild to wild, the big name in local sausage can be fully tasted here. 
 
“Mad Mike’s adds that amazing flavor for every dog and sausage, except those listed as Vienna Beef hot dogs,” she said. “His chicken sausage is simply the best I’ve ever tasted.” 
 
The gourmet Sonoran Dog, a bacon wrapped 8-inch hot dog, topped with refried beans, flavorful homemade guacamole, pico de gallo and drizzled with sour cream all on a sweet hot dog bun will satisfy lovers of the traditional Mexican hot dog. Swanger’s guacamole will have you begging for the recipe though it’s a trade secret. The hand-cut chips are an ideal side for this dish, salted, light and crisp, not greasy in any way. 
 
 A whimsical example of “farm to table,” Suzette Swanger shows how the potatoes from their grower transform into the thinly sliced potato chips they make and serve daily at Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs. Ashley Ludwig photo.   
“We’re becoming famous for our chips,” she said. 
 
Fans and friends of Devil Dogs can come for any game, any time, and the television will never be turned off before the game is done. 
 
“We won’t throw people out just because it’s after our closing time, if the game goes long,” she said. 
 
“The name, ‘Devil Dogs’ is a United States Marine Corps reference, though our family isn’t in the military,” she said. “We kept that name because we are proud to be Americans, and of our soldiers in this military town. That’s why we decided to focus on Patriot Day for a raffle and fundraiser.” 
 
The donations for this fundraiser, to raise funds toward the U.S. Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command Foundation are growing daily. 
 
“We are big fans of this local charitable foundation that raises funds for local Marine families,” she said. “That, and with Patriot Day coming, we knew we needed to do something to help.”

The Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs fundraiser will run from Friday, Sept. 11 through Tuesday, Sept. 15 with all proceeds benefitting the MARSOC Foundation. Raffle items will include Mad Mike’s American Gourmet Products, a golf package, and a guitar donated by Pabst Blue Ribbon. 
 
“When we learned about the MARSOC Foundation, we knew we needed to do something to draw attention to this organization,” she said.

4348,"Some weekend Central Asia reads: The manhunt for Tajikistan’s former deputy defense minister, Abduhalim Nazarzoda, is on. After the September 4 events that authorities report resulted in the deaths of nine police officers and 17 “terrorists,” the state formally charged Nazarzoda with “high treason, terrorism, sabotage, and creating an extremist group.” The authorities said on September 5 that the renegade general had fled to Romit Gorge, with seven to eight supporters. The numbers were arbitrary. The following days were filled with claims by the Tajik government to have arrested 17 members of Nazarzoda’s group “as a result of special operations” in Romit Gorge. As Asia-Plus reports, “According to official data, security forces have killed 22 members of Nazarzoda group and arrested more than 100 others, since the operation against the group was launched.” While the manhunt continues, read up on Nazarzoda to get a better picture of who the general is and what led up to the events of September 4. First check out Eurasianet’s profile of Nazarzoda. Then read Farangis Najibullah’s profile for RFE/RL, which goes deeper into explaining how Nazarzoda navigated the civil war and fit himself into the post-war peace arrangements. While Tajikistan’s September 9 Independence Day was marred by the ongoing manhunt, a different celebration in neighboring Uzbekistan also proceeded under significant gloom. The recently-fired director of the Nukus Art Museum which houses Igor Savitsky’s prized collection of banned Soviet art, Marinika Babanazarova, was absent from the museum’s centenary celebration of Savitsky’s birth. Agnieszka Pikulicka-Wilczewska wrote about the celebration for Eurasianet, noting that the the rainy day “felt like an omen.” In another art-related story in Uzbekistan, the European magazine Cafebabel interviewed Umida Akhmedova, an Uzbek photojournalist and documentary filmmaker who was convicted in 2010 of “defamation” and “insult” related to a documentary she had made with her husband about rural life in Uzbekistan. The government said they “had discredited and disrespected the traditions and values ​​of the Uzbek people.” While Akhmedova was quickly released, life remains difficult for her as an artist in the country. As Kyrgyzstan enters the month-long campaign season leading up to the October 4 parliamentary election, IWPR’s Timur Toktonaliev interviewed Tamerlan Ibraimov, director of the Center for Political and Legal Studies in Kyrgyzstan, about the development and evolution of rule of law in the country. While the Kyrgyz constitution enshrines the rule of law, Toktonaliev asks if that is really the case. In response, Ibraimov says right now the reality is that “ the law works in some cases, while elsewhere it is other things that prevail. Take what’s called ‘telephone law’ – when matters are resolved by a phone call from above. Or corruption, where what counts is who pays the most.” The interview dives into the erosion of the rule of law prior to Kyrgyzstan’s independence from the Soviet Union as well as the increasing role of religion in providing “answers to both spiritual and political questions.” Also a month away are Kazakhstan’s celebrations in Taraz of the 550th anniversary of the Kazakh Khanate. This weekend Astana is hosting a celebration of its own, part of an ongoing geopolitical and nationalistic statement. In August 2014, Putin responded to a question regarding Russian concern about nationalism in Ukraine and rising nationalism in Kazakhstan by saying that Nazarbayev had “created a state on a territory where there had never been a state. The Kazakhs had never had statehood. He founded it.” Nate Schenkkan translated the entire exchange and provided insightful commentary last year on Registan, writing that “this is an extraordinary event. I don’t know how the Kazakh government will respond to this, but assuredly there are people in Astana in very high places who are both scared and furious.”",a14e0c13-564e-485c-a273-6cbd742402c3,Blog,2015-09-11T16:13:18Z,The Diplomat,Current Events Overshadow Anniversaries in Central Asia,1.0,Blog

4973,"New Porous Hydrogel Could Improve the Success of Stem Cell Tissue Regeneration	Greetings, New Porous Hydrogel Could Improve the Success of Stem Cell Tissue Regeneration A New Porous Hydrogel Could Boost the Success of Stem-Cell Tissue Regeneration
In this image, new bone structure has formed after stem cells were transplanted using the novel hydrogel strategy developed at the Wyss Institute.
Using a new porous hydrogel, scientists have experimentally improved bone repair by boosting the survival rate of transplanted stem cells and influencing their cell differentiation. Possible stem cell therapies often are limited by low survival of transplanted stem cells and the lack of precise control over their differentiation into the cell types needed to repair or replace injured tissues. A team led by David Mooney, a core faculty member at Harvard’s Wyss Institute, has now developed a strategy that has experimentally improved bone repair by boosting the survival rate of transplanted stem cells and influencing their cell differentiation. The method embeds stem cells into porous, transplantable hydrogels.
In addition to Mooney, the team included Georg Duda, a Wyss associate faculty member and director of the Julius Wolff Institute for Biomechanics and Musculoskeletal Regeneration at Charité – Universitätsmedizin in Berlin, and Wyss Institute founding director Donald Ingber. The team published its findings in today’s issue of Nature Materials. Mooney is also the Robert P. Pinkas Family Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Stem cell therapies have potential for repairing many tissues and bones, or even for replacing organs. Tissue-specific stem cells can now be generated in the laboratory. However, no matter how well they grow in the lab, stem cells must survive and function properly after transplantation. Getting them to do so has been a major challenge for researchers…..More Related",6987adbd-31ce-4e3b-84f7-af6e2a795a1c,Blog,2015-09-16T15:10:23Z,Hiram's 1555 Blog,New Porous Hydrogel Could Improve the Success of Stem Cell Tissue Regeneration,1.0,Blog

854,"Europe Ukraine Campaigns to Strip Russia of Its UN Veto Power September 16, 2015 FILE - Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin speaks during a U.N. Security Council meeting on the Ukraine crisis, March 15, 2014, at United Nations headquarters in New York. Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Email to a Friend Ukraine intends to pursue its campaign to strip Russia of its U.N. Security Council veto power at the United Nations General Assembly annual meeting and debate later this month. Ukraine's parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, voted unanimously Wednesday in favor of an international initiative to preventing use of the veto to block Security Council resolutions or action in cases where ""conflicts become especially rigid."" Ukrainian officials said they envision phasing in gradually any restrictions on the use of the veto in the Security Council, and eventually abolish entirely the power of a single state to block votes. Ukraine's U.N. ambassador, Yuriy Sergeyev, tweeted Tuesday that 67 of the General Assembly's 193 members have indicated they support such a move. Russia has dismissed the Ukrainian proposal. Although Ukraine's proposal to reform Council procedures would apply to all five permanent members, it is aimed specifically at Russia, which used its veto six months ago to block a Security Council resolution supporting Ukraine's claim that Moscow is guilty of ""military aggression"" against Ukraine. Kyiv condemns Russia's active support for separatists fighting to break away from Ukraine and for its annexation of Crimea, which had been part of Ukraine. Moscow claims the turmoil in Ukraine since early 2014 is a ""civil war"" in which it has played no role. In late July Moscow wielded its veto power to block a U.N. Security Council resolution to create an international tribunal that would bring to account those responsible for the shootdown in July of 2014 of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine. Investigators implicate Russia in the downing, which killed 298 people. Moscow puts the blame on Ukraine, saying the incident took place in its airspace. The United States, Britain and France, which also have veto power on the Security Council, have criticized previous blocking votes by Russia and by China, especially those that have prevented the Council from imposing sanctions on the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad. The Western powers have supported Ukraine's claims against Russia, but they have avoided taking a position on Kyiv's proposal to abolish the veto. Russia's U.N. envoy, Vitaly Churkin, was quoted Wednesday as saying the permanent Council members' veto right ""is a very important mechanism,"" one that can result in compromise settlements in disputes where member states are bitterly divided. The U.N. Security Council has five permanent members - the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China - with veto powers, and a single permanent member can block any Council action, even if it is backed by all other members. Ten U.N. member states hold temporary, rotating seats on the Council. Temporary members participate in consultations and meetings, and they do vote on Council statements and resolutions, but they cannot block measures that are supported by a majority of the 15 members. Ukraine hopes to be elected to serve as a temporary Council member when membership changes are decided in New York on October 15.

TUCSON, Ariz. - A Border Patrol agent has been charged with second-degree murder in the death of a Mexican teenager who was shot from the U.S. side of the border in 2012. 

Lonnie Swartz was indicted Wednesday by a federal grand jury that reviewed the death of 16-year-old Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez, who was shot about 10 times. 

The Border Patrol has said that Elena Rodriguez was among a group of rock throwers endangering agents' lives. His family insists the boy was walking home from a basketball game with friends and was not armed or hurling rocks. 

Luis Parra, the attorney for the boy's mother, said the family was grateful to the Department of Justice ""for this first step in the pursuit of justice,"" and they ""remain steadfast in their resolve to seek full transparency"" from the Border Patrol. 

Swartz's attorney, Sean Chapman, did not respond to a call seeking comment. He told The Arizona Daily Star that he expects his client to plead not guilty at an Oct. 9 arraignment. The U.S. Attorney's Office did not respond to a request for comment. 

Swartz also faces a federal civil rights lawsuit in the death of the teen, who was in Nogales, Sonora, on Oct. 10, 2012, when Swartz fired from Nogales, Arizona. 

The case happened amid criticism that the Border Patrol uses force indiscriminately, a charge the agency has denied. Border Patrol agents are generally allowed to use lethal force against rock throwers because rocks can be deadly. Rock throwers have attacked agents more than 1,700 times since 2010, according to the agency. 

Chapman tried to get the family's lawsuit thrown out on the grounds that the Constitution does not apply to the boy, a Mexican citizen, because he was in Mexico at the time of the shooting. 

A federal judge in July ruled that the lawsuit can go forward. 

In a similar case in Texas, a federal appeals court ruled that a teen killed in Mexico by a border agent in El Paso, Texas, was not protected by the Constitution. 

Border Patrol agent Jesus Mesa Jr. shot 15-year-old Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca in 2010 near a bridge between El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua. 

Authorities said Mesa was trying to arrest immigrants who had illegally crossed into the country when rock throwers attacked him. Mesa fired his weapon across the Rio Grande, striking the teen twice. 

A three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals originally said Hernandez Guereca's family could sue Mesa. But the full court overturned that ruling in April.

3379,"Overhaul put on ice to allow major 'reset' on reform. In one of his first acts after becoming Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull last week secretly suspended all work on the Abbott government's white paper on taxation, just weeks before it was due to deliver its first preliminary report.

Stunned bureaucrats at the Federal Treasury, the Tax White Paper Taskforce and the Board of Taxation, were last week told work on the white paper - instigated by former treasurer Joe Hockey in 2014 - would come to a complete halt.

""We were told to put everything on ice, and that a 'reset' on tax reform was taking place,"" said one senior executive.

""It came as a shock. We have invested tens of thousands of man hours. Over a thousand submissions have been received for the discussion paper. It looks like all that work, the biggest review of taxation ever undertaken in this country, is now dead in the water.""

The first green paper from the process was due to be released in just seven weeks' time.

""We will not be releasing that paper until next year,"" Fairfax Media was told.

Mr Turnbull's move to halt the white paper process was made before he appointed Scott Morrison as Treasurer.

It is believed that Treasury Secretary John Fraser was instructed to communicate that news last week. Rethink from the ground up

""From what I have been told, the entire process has been brought to a halt because we 'have to rethink taxation from the ground up' and it's a ""reset on tax policy'. They are the words used by the Prime Minister's office,"" Fairfax Media was told.

Major corporations, industry bodies and interest groups have already spent hundreds of millions of dollars on taxation advice and legal advice to make submissions to Canberra for the white paper. The Business Council of Australia's submission alone runs to 75 pages.

The CEO of one of Australia's key alcohol industry groups confirmed they had spent $500,000 on tax advice. ""And we are one of the smaller spenders,"" the CEO said.

""I have no doubt this whole process has cost Australian industry hundreds of millions of dollars. I can't even imagine what the big mining companies and banks have spent preparing their submissions.""

The Tax White Paper Taskforce has had more than 700 public submissions uploaded to its website, from companies including ANZ Bank and BHP Billiton to British American Tobacco. It is believed that a similar number of confidential submissions have been also received. Abbot pledged election target

Former prime minister Tony Abbott signed off on the white paper's terms of ­reference in early December, and promised to take to the next election any ­recommendations his government adopted from the process, which had a year to report. After some extensions and revision to the terms of reference, that final report was due in the first quarter of next year, with a tax policy to be formulated before the federal election due sometime next year.

Former Treasury secretary Ken Henry, who was also involved in introducing the GST, this week advised Mr Turnbull to defer the tax reform package until after the next election.

""I fear we have kicked the can down the road on tax reform and won't do anything until after the next election,"" said one backbench MP.

But other Liberals believe Mr Turnbull will now push ahead with an ambitious program of tax reform.

In 2005, as a new member of federal parliament, Mr Turnbull infuriated then treasurer Peter Costello by commissioning his own tax reform package, which he paid for out of his own pocket.

Called the The Taxation Reform in Australia: Some Alternatives and Indicative Costings paper, Mr Turnbull argued for a flatter personal tax rate system, with a top marginal rate of either 35 or 40 cents in the dollar. That paper was publicly pilloried by Mr Costello at the time.

""I think you will find that Costello plays a fairly significant role in what happens next,"" said a leading Victorian Liberal.

He pointed out that Mr Morrison had enlisted Mr Costello's former chief of staff, Phil Gaetjens, as his new chief of staff, while another Costello loyalist, Kelly O'Dwyer, has been appointed assistant Treasurer and promoted to federal cabinet.

The Australian Financial Review has reported that Mr Morrison is close to Mr Costello and ""confides in him frequently"", and sought his advice on what to do on the night of the leadership spill.

Mr Morrison has also picked up other Costello staffers, including Sascha Grebe.

""I have no doubt that Malcolm needs Costello's support on tax reform, which is why you have seen those moves.""

4802,"Traveling on a plane can come with a slew of seat-based comfort challenges, whether you’re assigned to a seat that doesn’t recline or located just adjacent to the bathroom. If you want to get the best seat without having to pay extra cash, there are a few simple tips to follow. While you might not feel like you’re lounging in a featherbed in one of the many luxury hotels in Milan, you will optimize your chances of having a travel experience that’s comfortable, pleasant and relaxed. 1. Don’t Pre-Select Seats Many flyers are tempted to pre-choose seats when they book their plane flights on Hipmunk. However, it’s best to actually let the airline assign you seats when you check in; particularly for full flights. Airlines cannot require you to pay for premium seats if they are the only spots available. If you wait until everyone else on the plane has chosen a seat, there’s a good chance that one of the premium seats will be assigned to you at no cost. 2. Volunteer to Sit in an Emergency Exit Flight attendants need to fill emergency exit rows with capable passengers who can assist in an emergency. If you feel physically fit, you can volunteer to move to an exit row if flight attendants are looking to fill the seats (or swap someone out who is not qualified). Sitting in an exit row affords you a lot of extra leg room. It’s also often is an emptier row, as airlines usually pre-charge an extra fee to sit there. 3. Fly During the Middle of the Week Statistics show that the smallest number of travelers fly on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. To ensure you have the most room on the plane–and the biggest selection of great seats–fly during the work week. 4. Take Seats Freed by Upgrades Once you board a plane, some may opt to pay extra for first class or business class seats. Ask if you can take the seats they left empty. Many of these seats will have been occupied by frequent flyers or business travelers, which means that you might earn yourself a premium seat with extra legroom, greater recline or other great features. No matter whether you’re crossing a few state lines or the Pacific Ocean, having a comfortable seat can ensure you have a restful and pleasant flight. By following a few simple tips, you can find yourself the best seat possible without forking over any extra dough.",f8ce2cfd-95f7-44ec-ae5b-330d24eb75c1,Blog,2015-09-02T16:17:07Z,Tailwind by Hipmunk,How to Get the Best Seat on the Plane,1.0,Blog

Fukuoka and Tokyo 

To celebrate its 100th anniversary, Toto opened ""Toto Museum"" last month in Kitakyushu of Fukuoka prefecture to provide visitors an opportunity to learn about the philosophy behind its manufacturing and how product have developed. 

In the run-up to celebrating its centenary in 2017, the key promise that Japanese sanitary-ware giant Toto Group is constantly delivering is its determination to never stop creating and developing innovation with great design for all kinds of customers. 

To ensure its research and development in the field of plumbing equipment and products is right on track to improve people's lifestyle and culture, the Fukuoka-based manufacturer reserves around 18.5 billion yen (Bt5.5 billion) a year - accounting for 3 to 4 per cent of its annual turnover - for investment in innovative technology and design. 

And to explain its philosophy, one needs look no further than the 35-year history of the group's Washlet toilet-seat technology. 

Hiroshi Hashimoto, researcher for the product research and development department at Toto's Research Institute in Tokyo, said the latest cutting-edge toilet seat had been created with a variety of functions to make people's lives comfortable, convenient and clean. 

During last week's visit to the institute, Hashimoto, who has been deeply involved in the company's technological development with Washlet and helps produce many of Toto's different types of watering technologies, said that in the development process, it was crucial for the customer's voice to be heard in order to ensure that Washlet could respond satisfactorily to what the public wanted. 

""Our company began with basic experiments by cooperating with 300 company members to find the best angle of water spraying and cleaning. We found out that 43 degrees was the best angle to adjust water flow to the human body, and for cleanliness of the nozzle from dropping water,"" he explained. 

Apart from this, the temperature of the water, air-dryer and seat in a lavatory are also important for users, and Toto found that 38 degrees Celsius, 50 degrees and 36 degrees, respectively, were the most suitable, he added. 

However, toilets of today and tomorrow require more advanced technology, including self-cleansing, flushing and water-saving technology for maintaining people's hygiene, said the researcher. 

Clean and green 

In response to this demand, his firm has placed emphasis on clean and green technology, which covers design for dirt prevention such as Sana Gloss, rimless and tornado flushing and advanced cleansing with ewater+ (electrolised water) and Actilight (light-activated technology). 

To conserve water, Toto has spent more than 30 years developing and designing new Washlet models that consume less water. 

The NEOREST-tankless Washlet range, Toto's latest models, are able to use about 3.3 litres to 3.8 litres per flush, which is dramatically less than for the original model launched in 1976, which consumed 13 litres per flush. 

It's no wonder then, says Hashimoto, that Washlet and other water-and-energy-saving-oriented accessories are the preferred choice of luxury hotels and up-scale properties: Banyan Tree Shanghai On The Bund in China, Hotel Schloss Elmau in Germany, The South Beach in Singapore and three properties in Thailand - the Central Embassy, Okura Prestige Bangkok and Le Meridien Bangkok hotels. 

Not only does the firm concentrate more on creating environmentally friendly products, but it also has put a high priority on the development of barrier-free lavatories, particularly for wheelchair users, the elderly, hospital patients and children. 

To showcase its latest technology, products as well as history, the company recently opened the Toto Museum in the same grounds as its factory in Fukuoka prefecture, as part of the commemoration of the hundredth anniversary of the company's establishment, in two years' time. 

The museum aims to provide visitors with an opportunity to learn about the philosophy behind its manufacturing, and how the group's products have developed over time. 

Furthermore, the company has launched a state-of-art toilet, ""Gallery Toto"", at Narita Airport's Terminal 2 to provide an advanced toilet experience for international travellers, in the hope of extending its product experience and brand awareness globally.",8e27eb26-e917-4ad8-a71c-d82f6d221367,News,2015-09-17T17:15:06Z,The Nation - Thailand,"Flushed with success, Toto pledges to take toilet innovation and design to next level",0.0,Blog

1087,"England head coach Stuart Lancaster has denied his decision to suspend Manu Tuilagi from the team until January came in the knowledge that the centre would not be fit.

Lancaster revealed the disciplinary measure against Tuilagi after the 24-year-old was found guilty at Leicester Magistrates Court in mid-May of two counts of assaulting a police officer, assault by beating and causing criminal damage.

The centre this week insisted he had not assaulted anyone, despite pleading guilty, and that that was an action he had taken following advice from his lawyer in an attempt to conclude the court case as quickly as possible.

He also said he had told Lancaster he would not be fit in time for the World Cup, which begins on Friday when England host Fiji at Twickenham, because of the recurring groin injury he hopes to return from at Christmas.

""As far as we were concerned, we didn't know if he was going to be fit or not. We were hoping he was,"" Lancaster said. ""He was very much in the Ben Morgan category for me. Ben Morgan was injured at the time but we were going to bring Ben into the camp even if he wasn't quite right to allow him as long a time as possible - that was our take on it.

""The decision changed off the back of the court decision, from our point of view. You never know how long these injuries are going to take.

""I waited for the court to make their decision and reacted off the back of that. The decision was made that he was found guilty. Yes [I would have taken the same action had Tuilagi been fit].

""My decision was always going to be based on whatever the court decided, and the court decided that he was guilty.""

Lancaster also revealed that on Sunday he will conclude selecting his starting XV to face Fiji and that he intends to start his strongest team.

""I think we've got to pick our strongest team to start with,"" he said. ""We obviously trust the guys in the squad, so sometimes you might freshen the team up by changing a Joe Launchbury for Courtney Lawes, Ben Morgan and Billy Vunipola, Danny Care...

""

""There's all sorts of changes we could make, but not wholesale changes. There's bound to be injuries. I don't think any team has gone throughout a tournament without one of those. I think in 2011 there were only three players who played in all seven games.""",a3f0d3f5-db2d-478f-8e10-6e51b0840e44,News,2015-09-15T03:20:58Z,Canberra Times,Fitness not part of Tuilagi call: coach,0.0,News

The bottom line is all companies need to be more diligent with Form I-9 compliance.

46,"Z Energy shares closed near a record high before the Super Fund's sell-off announcement. 
             
Z Energy has requested a share trading halt after cornerstone shareholders Infratil and the Government-owned Super Fund signalled they would be selling off shares in the fuel company. 
 
Infrastructure company Infratil said it would start to sell its 20 per cent stake - 80 million shares - from Tuesday evening. 
 
The New Zealand Superannuation Fund said it planned to reduce its one-fifth shareholding in the company by 4pm on Wednesday through a sale of shares to financial institutions. 
 
The Super Fund announcement was made shortly after the NZX closed on Tuesday so did not impact Z Energy's share price on the day, which closed near a record high at $6.63.  
 
However, it said it would retain more than a 10 per cent share in the business ""reflecting [its] confidence in Z Energy's business strategy and management team"". 
 
Z Energy shares have been bolstered by a proposed $785 million takeover of rival Caltex, announced in June. 
 
Super Fund chief investment officer Matt Whineray said the current market environment provided an opportunity to reduce the fund's large investment in Z Energy ""and realise further value from what has been a highly successful investment"".

1375,"click to enlargeHadas HinkisMary Ocher is about to evolve into her final form.Born Mariya Ocheretianskaya in Moscow in 1986, Mary Ocher (pronounced ""Oh-chur"") moved to Israel with her family at age four, then to Berlin at 20. In 2011 she caught the attention of the inimitable King Khan at a karaoke bar (he also lives in Berlin), and she recorded what's still her most recent full-length of new material, 2013's Eden, at his Moon Studios. He's not her only famous fan either: Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs contributed a quote to Ocher's press kit. ""Mary Ocher gives me the chills,"" she says. ""She frightens me with her feral soul. Her sound is of a true outsider artist, immaculately self-possessed. Was this recorded this century? Or out of a basement that's she's been imprisoned all her life?""
Her DIY roots and anything-goes aesthetic notwithstanding, Ocher is obviously too well-connected to qualify as an outsider. And she's definitely not locked in a basement—tonight at 10 PM, she plays a free show at Analogue in Logan Square as part of a solo North American tour. 
""Baby Indiana,"" the only track from Eden with a video, injects its acoustic dance trance with a vaguely Middle Eastern flavor. Ocher's broad vibrato and wildly slewing pitch center make her piercing voice sound giddy and a little loopy, but she uses the occasional dramatic overenunciation of a terminal consonant to ground it in an aura of ritual pronouncement.
In March of this year, Ocher released a digital-only two-volume collection of home recordings dating back to 2006. The Fictional Biography of Mary Ocher covers a dizzying amount of ground for music that sounds like it was made in a broom closet: its backing tracks include ghostly noise, sad but jaunty piano, frisky strumming, echoing ersatz funk, chintzy drum machine with vacuum-cleaner synth, and aimlessly gnawing distorted electric guitar. Ocher herself seems to have as many faces as a vaudeville performer: her multifarious singing leaps without warning from unhinged keening to warped drawling or from wobbly muttering to blustery declaiming.
Among tonight's openers is Gel Set, aka Laura ""Lulu"" Callier; I reviewed her first full-length, Human Salad, on the occasion of its release party in July. Ocher will be selling copies of a second edition of Eden, both on golden cassette tapes and on vinyl.",d61b0b74-ff62-491d-9b48-e0cd79b5d8fc,Blog,2015-09-10T17:00:00Z,Chicago Reader,Self-described 'outsider torch singer' Mary Ocher performs at Analogue tonight,1.0,News

3542,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Greg Ward Jr. threw for three touchdowns, including a 15-yarder to Demarcus Ayers with 3:09 remaining to rally Houston past Louisville 34-31 on Saturday.

Ward earlier hit Linell Bonner for a 22-yard TD during a wild fourth quarter that began tied 17-all before the teams erupted for 31 combined points. The Cougars ultimately got the final word in the back-and-forth contest thanks to their mobile junior QB and special teams, which partially blocked John Wallace's 53-yard field goal attempt with 54 seconds remaining to seal the signature win for first-year coach Tom Herman.

Houston (2-0) outgained Louisville 462-395 and recorded four turnovers and broke a three-game losing streak to the Cardinals (0-2). Brandon Wilson also returned a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown.

3780,"Whatever the ultimate outcome, Melissa Reid’s smile will provide the most endearing image of this Solheim Cup. Reid’s continuing success aside, the tournament on the outskirts of Heidelberg also bore witness to its capacity to stir up acrimony. It is routinely thus. Reid was afforded her 28th birthday afternoon in the company of family members having recovered from a 5am alarm call to secure a point and a half for Europe. Given the location, the Englishwoman’s form is all the more laudable. Reid holed for birdie at the 18th as she and Carlota Ciganda halved with Cristie Kerr and Lexi Thompson in completion of a delayed Friday fourball. Later, the same European duo saw off Alison Lee and Michelle Wie by 4&3. The hosts were strengthening their grip on a piece of Waterford Crystal, a matter offset by an American afternoon comeback. By close of play, Europe’s lead stood at 8-5 with three fourball matches still to be completed. That much rather sums up a messy event, which has not been aided by the kind of chronically slow play which hinders golf’s development at all levels. Players at this one should know better but appear beyond reproach as the spectacle suffers. Reid travelled here looking to create fresh German reference points. The horrible extent of her existing ones are well known; three years ago Reid’s mother, Joy, was killed in a motorway crash when heading to watch her daughter compete in Munich. After initially and understandably struggling so badly with the tragedy, the golfer has moved on both professionally and personally. Or, in her own words, “closed the circle”. This Solheim Cup marks the first return of Reid’s father, Brian, to Germany since he was involved in the 2012 accident. Related: Solheim Cup: Europe bank on the chemistry of Charley Hull and Melissa Reid “I’ve just been pulled away from my family,” a beaming Reid explained. “I can just tell that it’s completely different. Like everyone now is really, really excited, and everyone is enjoying themselves. “My dad is, my brother is, my sister, everybody is. It’s very important for me that I got as many memories for my family as possible. These are new memories. This is so far a much more successful, personally to me, Solheim Cup than it was in Killeen Castle [in 2011], obviously winning two and a half points out of three. So far it’s been an incredible week and we want to finish it off tomorrow. I’ve definitely got good memories now.” In displaying impressive diplomatic skills, Reid was less forthcoming about day-two’s needle. The American captain, Juli Inkster, reacted angrily to what she regarded as several on-course instances of advice towards players by a member of the European backroom staff, Annika Sorenstam. As per Solheim Cup rules, only captains can impart such words when play is underway. Sorenstam was accused of similar behaviour in Colorado two years ago. “I was aware of it, but I actually don’t know what went on,” said Reid. “I literally went in the team room, had some food. I don’t know what was going on. I’m trying to find out as much as you guys.” Inkster’s tenacity has been a notable part of this competition. If her team falls short, it will not be because the captain wasn’t in the mood for a scrap. There was further US annoyance at delays to the fourball session although this time the event organisers were in the line of fire. Catriona Matthew had finished her morning match only 15 minutes before her next round was scheduled to start. Under the rules, a 40-minute break is permitted. Still, this scene didn’t reflect well on officials. Thompson and Kerr recovered from their morning woes by seeing off Ciganda and Azahara Muñoz. Those matches, which will only be completed on Sundaymorning, and all of which are separated by just one hole, will be crucial to the singles dynamic. For now, Karine Icher and Matthew hold the advantage over Lizette Salas and Brittany Lang through 15 holes. America has the edge in the other two games; Alison Lee and Brittany Lincicome narrowly in front against Suzann Pettersen and Charley Hull, whilst Stacy Lewis and Gerina Piller have the same lead over Caroline Masson and Caroline Hedwall.",24b6f95f-8b92-4869-b704-8bd16da2404d,Blog,2015-09-19T19:22:18Z,Sport | The Guardian,Solheim Cup: Europe lead USA 8-5 but three day two matches unfinished,1.0,Blog
228,"Search the term ""cut crease"" on YouTube and you'll find hundreds of tutorials on the eye makeup look. Just as the name describes, it's a technique used to define the crease by ""cutting"" across it with a contrasting eyeshadow color and little to no blending. 
 
""If done right, a cut crease will change your makeup game if you have a medium to heavy fold. It lifts your eyes and makes them appear more open,"" says makeup artist and YouTuber Sona Gasparian . ""You instantly lift your eyelids with this technique. And what's great about it is that you can go super soft or really dramatic depending on your mood."" 
 
If you're new to the technique, she says a good tip is to keep the intensity on the outer corner of the eyes. 
 
""Start slow and build the intensity to achieve the most natural look,"" she says. ""The best way is to keep your eyes open when placing your cut crease. Look straight in the mirror and place a line where you want your new fold to appear, and start to build the shadow over the line blending upward."" 
 
Gasparian says she likes to keep her makeup looks natural, so she blends her cut crease a little more than usual and demonstrates it in her Taylor Swift Bad Blood Makeup Tutorial below:

PdCinRVA!! Meet up Saturday Night at 7pm
Location: New York Deli
2920 West Carey St, Richmond

 
It's about two miles west of the race course.

...

Hey y'all! [That's southern for Welcome!]

I am sitting in the salle de presse at the moment, receiving confirmation that I am now closer to Eddy Merckx (in terms of physical proximity) than ever before. So I have that going for me. This is a Paris-Roubaix-sized press center.


    





Not too shabby. I'm told it's bizarrely convenient by press room standards. That's all very interesting to you I'm sure. Richmond is still pretty sleepy, and might remain that way for a while. Tomorrow will be more like a normal day for the locals with minimal race activity, and my suspicion is that downtown won't get really crazy until the weekend, but we'll see about this afternoon, the men's elite ITT being one of the marquee events.

First amusing scene: a sausage vendor with ""welcome UCI"" plastered over a board. It's probably too much to explain that the UCI is the governing body and nobody, outside the press, is here to interact with them or even acknowledge their existence. The name ""UCI"" definitely does not imply the riders too. Yeah, probably too much to explain. I'm sure there will be other bits of evidence of just how unusual it is to have this event here. But strange does not preclude awesome. So when I chide, I chide with love.

The PdC House opened yesterday, I being the last to arrive. Current occupants include Drew, Jens, Jimbo, Crashdan and of course Megabeth, with Sui Juris, Elvisgoat and Ant1 expected before long. JFS_PGH stopped by for breafast. SWells is lurking at a crossing somewhere close by (he got a prime spot, as course marshaling goes).

Oh, and the best news of all. I will experience something wonderful, something long anticipated, for the first time in my life. Thanks to Jens and his bulky suitcase.

5602,"Mario Maker feels like a game that should not exist. Consider this: Nintendo is the sort of company that has specific ideas about the way Bowser would drink a cup of coffee in a movie. It is the sort of company that would develop a height graph, so game developers always know what size a character can be in relation to other creatures in the Mushroom Kingdom. Nintendo is very particular about how it wants the world to consume its games, and this attention to detail is part of what makes Nintendo great. Nintendo is the Disney of the gaming world; a controlling, creative titan that creates beloved characters with shocking regularity.
Enter Super Mario Maker, a game about making Mario games. In it, people other than Nintendo are free to use official Mario iconography to create ridiculous levels, then cover those levels with dicks. Is Nintendo really just handing over their playbox and letting people loose with it? Can I seriously take Nintendo’s most famous mascot and put him through a hellscape of my making…with Nintendo’s blessing?
Advertisement Well, OK then. Mario Maker has two major components. There’s the creation suite, which allows players to make their own levels. Then there’s the play hub, where you can simply enjoy Mario Maker levels made by other people. There, you will find the “10 Mario Challenge,” a mode where you have ten lives to beat eight random levels made by Nintendo designers. While it may be tempting to jump into stage creation right away, I found that playing through the 10 Mario Challenge was a better idea, at least to start out. Nintendo has made a point of creating short, punchy levels that defy the expectations they’ve set over their years making Mario games. It’s a provocative mode that plays with the Mario formula, at once evoking nostalgia while also telling you to forget what what you think you know about Mario. This, in turn, encourages you to experiment beyond what you might think is possible in your own levels. The 10 Mario Challenge is instructive in the most hands-on way possible. In one level, you might find an underground party when you go down a pipe. In a different level, you might find that the only thing that’s standing between you and the flagpole is a stack of giant enemies crowned by Bowser, and you have to figure out a way to defeat them all without getting hit by a projectile. In another level, you might turn into a spring after ingesting a mushroom. Its the sort of thing that makes me wonder just what was stopping Nintendo from making levels that felt this fresh in the first place. This is Nintendo, letting its hair down—and the result is a game that feels exciting and new, even though yes, we’ve been stomping Goombas with our favorite plumber for over thirty (!) years now. This sense of vitality is everywhere in Mario Maker, from the weird levels down to the vibrant menus. Mario Maker looks less like what you’d expect an official Mario game to look like, and more like a remix that could have been made by a studio like Crossy Road and Pac-Man 256-maker Hipster Whale. Even the some of the original sprites have been updated—they now have finer details that previously weren’t there. What I’m saying is: Mario Maker looks hot as hell. Let’s talk about level creation. Ostensibly, this is the entire point of Mario Maker: to create stuff. This was somewhat of an awkward proposition for me, someone who struggles with open-ended creativity—I was the kid that didn’t know what to do with Lego. I thought I wouldn’t find much to like in the level-creation process, and instead wanted to use Mario Maker as a means to play stuff others create. But Mario Maker is so welcoming that I found myself happily experimenting with Koopas and question-mark blocks right away, eventually graduating to full-on levels that I was proud of. Any element you might find in a 2D Mario game, you can just place on your level with a simple tap. Anything that can occupy a large space can be placed and dragged and made longer. You can change the style of your level based on the different eras of Mario games across the years, from the original up to New Super Mario Bros U. Eventually, you’ll even unlock special sound and visual effects that can add an extra layer of liveliness to your levels (I’m sure the community won’t abuse this at all!) It’s the most intuitive game creation tool I’ve ever used; it does for games what the point-and-click did for photography—only with way more spirit. When you place something down in a level, the level actually sings for you. Building an entire course sounds like harmony. In this sense, Mario Maker feels revolutionary. Even a kid could make a level with ease. Why aren’t there more tools like this, but for other kinds of game?
The tools themselves hide wonderful secrets. Shake a green Koopa, and it’ll turn into a red Koopa. Shake a Lakitu, and you’ll be left with its cloud—which you can actually ride. Add a mushroom to an enemy, and it’ll grow larger. All of these components stay frozen them until you press “Play,” at which point the level goes live and you can test out whatever you made. And if Mario dies during this testing phase, it simply reverts back to creation mode, which allows you to tweak as you see fit. I found myself swapping between the frozen and live mode frequently, as I felt out what made the most sense for that particular level. Part of the reason why Mario Maker feels so generous is that, by giving me this box of toys, Nintendo has given me a first-hand look at what makes Mario, well, Mario. It’s given me a new appreciation for what they’ve created in the past, especially when I felt stumped as to how to make a level of mine pop. Even the O.G. 1-1 has a quiet brilliance that may not be immediately obvious until you break it down, square by square, and see the subtle ways in which Nintendo has been gently guiding us all along. My biggest complaint about Mario Maker’s tools is that you can’t use them all from the outset. You only have access to a limited number of things at the start, and it takes nine days of actively creating levels for at least five minutes to unlock everything on offer. It’s the most Nintendo thing ever, and they justify it by saying that this is their way of easing you into the tools. They want to make sure you understand every set of objects they have before actually letting you tinker with more advanced stuff. It makes a sort of sense, but it’s still kind of annoying. This, in conjunction with the incredible number of costume unlocks, make Mario Maker feel like more than just a toolbox. It’s game design, gamified. Level creation requires assets. You’re going to need to work for those assets, if not purchase a few Amiibo. Once you build a level, you can save it to your system or upload it to the web. Before you can share it with others, you have to actually beat your course—which means you can’t make anything impossible, or beyond your own skills. I appreciate this reality check, because it means that online levels can’t get too out of hand. From there, you wait. You’ll be notified whenever someone plays your level, or leaves a comment on it. You can also get a sense of how difficult your course is based on completion percentages, or by taking a look at where on your course people have died. This information is also visible when you zoom in on other people’s courses, too. [This level is way harder than I intended—barely anyone can beat it!] Nintendo has basically built a mini social network just for Mario Maker called “Course World.” Through it, you can check out a variety of different courses people have uploaded, all sorted into different categories. There’s the “Featured” tab, which is front and center. I’m not 100% clear on how Nintendo picks these courses, or if they’re automated, but either way, the courses that become featured are the most visible courses in Mario Maker. That is where you want your courses to end up, which also means you have to deal with creating something palatable to other people. You have to pick a good name, and have a good concept, to facilitate being noticed—otherwise, nobody will play your stuff. This, I assume, will be a point of tension for some players who don’t have some marketing savvy. My version of Mario Maker only connects with people who have the game early. There are a very limited number of people online right now, likely microscopic in comparison to what the actual community will be like. Still, it’s obvious that Mario Maker, like all social media, will have its share of politics. There are already people who come up with cool ideas that gain traction, only to be aped by other hopefuls who then end up gaining more visibility—the Fat Jewishes of Mario Maker, essentially. There are already people who create levels based on well-known franchises, and end up piggy-backing on that success even if their course isn’t particularly good. There already are trends and fads, like courses that play themselves. I predict there will also be creators who become popular and known within the community, only to become scorned because they’re too visible—or at least, I found myself annoyed at times that certain names seemed to be everywhere on Mario Maker’s social hub. I have a feeling the online Course World is going to be a fascinating place once Mario Maker actually releases. If you see a course that you like on your Course World feed, you can download it for future use/tweaking, or you can “star” it. Stars function similarly to Likes on Facebook, in that the more stars a course has, the higher they’ll show up on the “Star Ranking” tab on Course World. And the more people who play and like your levels, the more courses you can upload. You can also follow specific people through Course World, and the game will notify you whenever those people make new stuff. It’s a system that rewards popularity, but I’m hoping that the game still leaves room for less conventional Mario levels too. It’s hard to say just yet.
As for what you’ll find online, well, you get a little bit of everything. If you try the 100 Mario Challenge, you’ll get a grab bag of levels, some of which are really creative, some of which are clearly just someone fucking around. Personally, I liked messing with easy and normal mode the best—I found that these types of courses were more likely to try something creative or fun. Some of my favorites include... A Donkey Kong themed level: A level with Metroid-Like progression: [Source: Pixelkabinett] A shmup: [Source: GameXplain] Roller-coaster type levels: And this troll level: Then there’s expert mode. I’m sure that Mario connoisseurs will love this offering, and that there will be a variety of absurd Kaizo-Level courses in no time. My issue is that many of the expert courses I came across didn’t really ramp up and ease you into the difficulty, nor do courses typically teach you how to play them at that level. Many of them kind of slap you in the face from the get go, or appear to be going for difficulty for the sake of difficulty. There is no palpable sense of design or purpose beyond stripped-down game-designer sadism. [An example of the sort of fucked-up stuff you can expect from asshole Mario Maker creators, courtesy of Jeffrey Grubb] It’s here that the biggest “flaw” of Mario Maker comes through: lots of people simply do not have that je ne sais quoi, that classic Nintendo touch. Mario levels are so memorable because Nintendo puts effort into making sure levels can be enjoyed both by beginners and experts. Levels they create go through an intense iterative process that puts function and design above all else. Miyamoto has been known to playtest games by watching people’s expressions while they play games, to get an honest reaction to a level. I don’t know if this feeling can be taught, exactly—there are interviews where Miyamoto says he bases design based on “what feels good instinctively,” and has even expressed that sometimes, this sixth sense is difficult to describe to the staff at Nintendo. It’s just the sort of thing that he knows when he sees it. Sometimes, exceptional design simply cannot be captured in words; it can merely be observed and felt. Through years of experience, Nintendo has developed a good system that can eventually carve out the finest platformers around. Mario Maker tries to guide you via tips and sample levels, but there is only so much that it can pass on to its players. The only real thing you can do is make what you want, send it off into the void, and hope for the best. It’s that rawness that separates Mario Maker from core Mario games—and what makes Mario Maker so interesting in the first place. The “flaw” isn’t really a flaw at all. Mario Maker is the embodiment of play, and play cannot always be wrangled or parceled for consumption. It can be messy, and weird, a and far too difficult, placing a tower of giant Bowsers in your path just because it can. I keep coming back to the idea that Mario Maker shouldn’t exist. It gleefully flies in the face of Nintendo’s controlling nature, and gives players the means with which to theoretically render every subsequent 2D Mario game obsolete. But Mario Maker is also a sign of Nintendo’s confidence. The world will never stop wanting that special Nintendo magic, and Nintendo knows that. Nintendo just want to give us a chance to make our own fun for a change and, in the process, learn to understand what they do a little better. Mario Maker is Nintendo going, Hey kid. You’ve seen what we can do. What about you?",e1ef180a-1010-4fc6-ac81-45b6a6383ba6,Blog,2015-09-02T14:00:00Z,io9,Super Mario Maker: The Kotaku Review,1.0,Blog

2895,"Harris County Precinct 4 works to provide relief for residents dealing with neighborhood nuisances. 
  
The Texas Neighborhood Nuisance Abatement Act gives the county authority to control nuisance properties that pose health and safety risks through legal action or by demolishing structures in unincorporated areas that are considered unsanitary, unsafe or abandoned. 
 
In September, Precinct 4 partnered with Harris County Public Health & Environmental Services (HCPHES) to abate a property in the Northwood Park subdivision, located at 21318 Tophill, at a cost of $8,769. Since 2011, the county has received more than 15 written complaints, daily calls and a petition signed by 72 Northwood Park residents about the property. 
 
In the last five years, an average of five properties in Precinct 4 have been demolished using funding from Precinct 4 and Harris County’s Community Services Department. While intended to improve public health, nuisance abatements can also help increase property values and improve quality of life. 
 
After receiving a complaint, Harris County Public Health investigates the property. If the property is in violation of any nuisance abatement laws, the agency gives the owner 30 days to address the violation or face civil or criminal prosecution. If the property is abandoned or the owner does not respond to warning notices or a notice to abate in a local newspaper, the county can demolish it and place a lien on the property. 
 
Other examples of neighborhood nuisances include accumulated rubbish, standing water, abandoned swimming pools, high weeds, dilapidated structures and any other conditions that breed disease-causing pests within a recorded subdivision or 300 feet from a recorded subdivision. 
 
To report a suspected nuisance property in unincorporated areas of Harris County, residents should contact the Environmental Health Division of Harris County’s Public Health & Environmental Services at 713-274-6300 Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.",57972988-4fff-44f9-8760-2b670650788d,News,2015-09-21T21:37:59Z,Waller County News Citizen,Precinct 4 Abates Nuisance Property,0.0,News

Two of the biggest sensations in R&B music are linking arms and heading out for a North American tour. Come inside and find out where you can see the Queen of Hip Hop Soul Mary J. Blige hitting the stage with talk show hostess Tamar Braxton. 
 
 
The Queen of Hip Hop Soul Mary J. Blige recently announced a 12-date U.S. tour and we’ve very excited to bring you the dates and the big news about who’s joining her. 
 
Mary is going from city to city with a new live show she’s dubbed “MJB Live!” which will start in Augusta, Ga. on October 30th and will breeze through Memphis, Florida, New Jersey and Georgia. 
 
Hmmm……if you have a Food Network fetish, you’ll notice that Mary is going to be passing through some “good eating” towns.  Good luck to her and her strict diet. We don’t think she’s had a carb since “No More Drama.” 
 
So who’ll join MJB?  Drum roll please……… 
 
 
It’s Slay-Tay!  With a new season of “Tamar & Vince” coming,   in addition to her day job on “The Real” and her currently stint on “DWTS” (by the way…she slayed her Quick Step), Tamar Braxton is ALL over the place. 
 
Because Tay Tay (shown above in a new pic with her newly DISengaged co-host Adrienne Bailon) is dropping her new album Calling All Lovers on October 2nd, the tour will be great support for her latest project.  But be forewarned……Tamar won’t be at every date. 
 
Check the dates below: 
 
 
Are you here for this?!

Crescent (United States) (AFP) | 20 September 2015 5:43 

Located in the middle of the country, far from any major fault lines, Oklahoma experienced 585 earthquakes of a magnitude of 3.0 or greater in 2014. That’s more than three times as many as the 180 which hit California last year. 
 
“It’s completely unprecedented,” said George Choy, a seismologist at the US Geological Survey. 
 
As of last month, Oklahoma has already experienced more than 600 quakes strong enough to rattle windows and rock cars. The biggest was a 4.5-magnitude quake that hit the small town of Crescent. 
 
Sandra Voskuhl, 76, grew up in the rural oil boomtown and said she has never felt the earth shake like it did on July 27. 
 
First came a thunderous boom. Then the red earth shook hard, Voskuhl said. 
 
“You heard it coming,” she said. “Everything shook.” 
 
She recalled screaming as framed pictures toppled over in her home. 
 
Then, when things got quiet, she drove over to the town’s Frontier Historical Museum to help clean up antique dishes that had crashed to the ground and shattered. 
 
“We need the oil for our workers and our economy,” she said. “But these earthquakes are a little scary.” 
 
– Could a ‘Big One’ hit? – 
   File picture shows anti-fracking demonstrators in New York as world leaders gathered for a UN General Assembly | © /AFP/File | Bryan Thomas   
Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is the process of shooting water mixed with sand and chemicals deep into the earth to crack rock formations and bring up oil and natural gas trapped inside. 
 
The process has unlocked massive amounts of oil and gas in Oklahoma and other states over the past decade. 
 
But along with the oil and gas comes plenty of that brackish water, which is disposed of by injecting it into separate wells that are dug as deep as a mile (less than two kilometers) below ground. 
 
The unnatural addition of the water can change pressure along fault lines, causing slips that make the earth shake, said Choy of the US Geological Survey. 
 
There is debate among scientists over how large of a fault could be reawakened, and how hard that fault might shake. 
 
One camp believes Oklahoma won’t see bigger than a 4.0 to 5.0-magnitude earthquake, which would be enough to break windows and knock things off shelves. 
 
Others believe a 7.0-magnitude earthquake could come about, which would be strong enough to topple buildings. 
 
“What’s at risk is that when you put water into the ground, it’s never going to come back out. You’re putting it in places it has never been before,” Choy told AFP. 
 
“The bigger the volume, the greater the area will be affected. And we don’t know what the long-term effect will be.” 
 
– 4,500 injection wells – 
 
The pace at which earthquake activity has increased has rattled many in Oklahoma, who are also worried about groundwater contamination brought on by fracking. 
 
From 1975 to 2008, the state experienced anywhere from zero to three earthquakes a year which registered at 3.0 or higher. 
 
Then the numbers jumped: there were 20 in 2009, 35 in 2010, 64 in 2011, 35 in 2012, 109 in 2013 and 585 in 2014. 
 
“We are the only state where once this problem came up, we just kept going (with fracking),” said Johnson Bridgwater, the executive director of the Oklahoma chapter of the Sierra Club, a prominent environmental group. 
 
“We want public safety to come first, rather than treating this state as a giant lab.” 
 
The danger is particularly acute given that Oklahoma has such an enormous oil and gas industry, and its pipelines, refineries and storage facilities were not built to withstand constant quakes, Bridgwater said. 
 
Oklahoma has about 4,500 disposal wells, with about 3,200 operating on any given day. 
 
State Governor Mary Fallin, a pro-business Republican, was slow to accept the link between fracking and earthquakes. 
 
She took action earlier this year after the science became clear, spokesman Alex Weintz said. 
 
It appears that an area known as the Arbuckle rock formation is most vulnerable because of its “unique geological features,” he noted. 
 
State regulators are now scrutinizing the operations of disposal wells in that area to ensure they don’t go too deep or inject too much water. 
 
Some operators have been told to cut the amount of water they inject into their wells and the state has also stepped up its monitoring. 
 
Three wells were shut down on Friday after two quakes – a 3.5 and a 4.1 – struck near Cushing, which has one of the largest crude oil storage facilities in the world. 
 
“We are hopeful that the actions taken by the Corporation Commission will have a significant impact on seismicity, but the process is ongoing and we’ll continue to evaluate the results that we’re getting now and potential future actions,” Weintz told AFP. 
 
The Sierra Club insists that much more needs to be done and has called for a moratorium on wastewater injection wells in the 21 Oklahoma counties identified to be most at risk.

612,"“Mountains seem to answer an increasing imaginative need in the West. More and more people are discovering a desire for them, and a powerful solace in them. At bottom, mountains, like all wildernesses, challenge our complacent conviction – so easy to lapse into – that the world has been made for humans by humans. Most of us exist for most of the time in worlds which are humanly arranged, themed and controlled. One forgets that there are environments which do not respond to the flick of a switch or the twist of a dial, and which have their own rhythms and orders of existence. Mountains correct this amnesia. By speaking of greater forces than we can possibly invoke, and by confronting us with greater spans of time than we can possibly envisage, mountains refute our excessive trust in the man-made. They pose profound questions about our durability and the importance of our schemes. They induce, I suppose, a modesty in us.”  ― Robert Macfarlane 
  
Read More Daily Reports From The John Muir Trail 
  
We returned to the John Muir Trail by heading back over Kearsarge Pass after a resupply. We made it just in time to avoid the storm on the way out, and were heading back to the trail with nothing but dry skies in the forecast. From the Kearsarge Pass trailhead, the path leads downhill towards Bubbs Creek and Vidette Meadow. We got a really early start on this day and stumbled upon a buck sleeping just off of the trail. The landscape here is dominated by the beautiful East Vidette Peak. I would love to come back here someday soon and make the scramble up to the summit. 
 
East Vidette Peak 
 
After reaching the end of the downhill hiking, we reached a flat section that meandered through the forest. It quickly began to climb, and we found ourselves looking out onto the beautiful Upper Vidette Meadow. The tree cover diminished as we gained elevation when we reached the 10,000ft elevation sign. I was excited for the next seven miles that would take us to Forester Pass at 13,110ft. 
 
Entering the Meadow 
 
Onto The Water 
 
Our next point of interest was Center Basin Creek. It was a special moment to cross the creek, and look out onto a granite wonderland without the interruption of a forest. For the first time, I could see just how high we would be climbing in order to get to the pass. We had a number of switchbacks to climb, so I began the process I’ve come to love so much, putting one foot in front of the other. My footsteps had become the metronome for the song of my life. My breathing was in perfect harmony. 
 
Beginning to Climb 
 
Looking Back 
 
Green Life 
 
We continued climbing up the wall of talus with the pass in sight. I was amazed at how in tune my lungs were with the surrounding air. I knew the oxygen levels were low, but my legs and lungs didn’t seem to notice. I was hiking at a pace usually reserved for low elevation climbs. I truly had my trail legs now. 
 
The Pass In Sight 
 
Alpine Lake 
 
Before I knew it, we were standing on the border of Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks. The views were absolutely spectacular at Forester Pass. We took some time to enjoy the landscape, and struck up a conversation with a few other hikers. 
 
At The Pass 
 
Looking North 
 
We began the descent from Forester Pass and it hit me just how big this day was going to be. Our goal was to reach Guitar Lake to set ourselves up for an early morning summit of Mt. Whitney. We had already hiked close to 10 miles with 3600ft of elevation gain, and we still had 16 miles to go if we wanted to reach our planned destination. Motivation came easy, as my heart and mind were intoxicated with the beauty of the Sierra, the peace of the trail, and the adrenaline from crossing a high pass. 
 
Looking South 
 
On The Trail 
 
There were a number of beautiful lakes in view as we lost elevation and pressed onward. At the end of the downhill, we crossed a large creek and then began a winding uphill climb on the side of a hill. Towards the end of the uphill climb, the landscape started to resemble what I’ve come to know as Hollywood’s interpretation of a Martian landscape. I knew that meant we had made it to the Bighorn Plateau. It was here that I got my first glimpse of Mt. Whitney from the East. 
 
On The Plateau 
 
Views of Whitney 
 
After the plateau, the trail once again headed downhill, this time to the Wright Creek drainage. There was a lot of shade in this area, and the day was turning out to be a warm one. At this point, we were only a few miles away from hitting 20 on the day, and my feet were starting to let me know. I feel like I can hike uphill for an eternity, but downhills beat my legs and feet up in a way that always leaves me praying for a swift end to all descents. We took a break near the water and gave our legs a chance to rest before making the final ascent of the day towards Guitar Lake. 
 
Final Downhill 
 
The final stretch of hiking for this day was a rather pleasant one, as the trail was shaded, and paralleled a creek for quite some time. The trail really started to level out as we reached Timberline Lake, and it was at that point we knew we were very close. Julia and I were both moving pretty slow at this point, but knowing how close we were to the finish kept our spirits high. 
 
Timberline Lake 
 
Approaching Guitar Lake 
 
When we finally arrived at Guitar Lake, we were surprised by how many tents were in the area. We had read to expect a crowd, but this was something completely unlike anything we had seen on the trail thus far. Much like Thousand Island Lake, I had to go searching for a great tent site. I’ve learned in my years of hiking, that heading uphill onto rocky surfaces will get you away from most people. The key is finding a place to pitch. It worked like a charm again this time, as I was able to find a perfect spot that had no one around.  I had packed an extra days worth of food incase were didn’t make it to Guitar Lake in one day. For the first time on the JMT, I had a true feast. It was so nice to gorge on two days worth of food for dinner! 
 
Guitar Lake 
 
The only downside to camping at Guitar Lake was being hit by the realization that this would be my final night on the John Muir Trail. Much like the night before reaching Santiago when I walked the Camino, the excitement I held in my heart was bittersweet. After reaching Mt. Whitney, the journey would be over.

1883,"Nkoranza, Sept. 15, GNA - Madam Stella Amoatemaa, Nkoranza Municipal Chief Executive (MCE), has advised parents and guardians to provide balanced diets to their children and wards before and during school hours.

She stressed that in schools where launch was not served, parents and guardians must take the necessary steps with the school authorities for the pupils to be fed well.

That, she said, encouraged the pupils to feel not only psychologically happy to stay in schools, but also provided them with good nutritional values for their proper physical growth and mental development, the MCE added.

Madam Amoatemaa gave the advice when she addressed parents and teachers at the 'My First Day at School' programme for the 2015-2016 Academic Year at basic schools in some selected communities within the Municipality.

The visit was to welcome newly-enrolled pupils to start their formal education.

The communities included Bredi Number One, Donkro-Nkwanta, Nkwabeng, Asonkwaa and Akumsa- Domase.

The MCE emphasized the need for teachers to work with commitment, dedication and 'loving hearts' for the pupils, by handling them as their own children, because that would motivate and sustain their interests in the schools, she said.

Earlier, Madam Amoatemaa commended Bayport Financial Services Limited (BFSL), a Ghanaian micro-finance company, for assisting the Assembly with a quantity of edible and non-edible items valued at GH¢ 500 towards the success of the 'My First Day at School' programme.

The items provided by the Techiman branch of the company at a short ceremony at Nkoranza included a quantity of Kalypo juice drinks, some boxes of biscuits, and packets of pencils.

They were distributed to the pupils, particularly the new entrants.

Mr. Ernest Asare Gyan, the Techiman branch Manager of BFSL said the donation was part of the company's corporate social responsibility to ensure quality education delivery in the Municipality.

4052,"SAN FRANCISCO , Sept. 22, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Twenty three cities and towns and two counties across California launched the HERO Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) Program today. HERO PACE financing enables homeowners to make energy- and water-efficiency improvements and pay for them through their property tax bill. Property owners repay the assessment over 5 to 20 years while obtaining immediate savings on utility bills. The HERO Program launched this week in the cities and towns of Burlingame , Ceres , Clayton , Cloverdale , Coalinga , Danville , Davis , El Cerrito , Eureka , Fairfield , Galt , Hanford , Healdsburg , Laguna Beach , Los Banos , Placerville , Porterville , Rio Vista , Suisun City , West Sacramento , Windsor , Woodland and Yorba Linda , as well as the unincorporated areas of Alameda and Yolo Counties. Residents of these municipalities may now submit applications for HERO financing. 

The HERO Program has now been adopted by 344 communities in California and is available to more than 10.5 million households. 
   
""The HERO Program makes it possible for homeowners to do both the right thing and the smart thing when it comes to water and energy conservation,"" said Alameda County Supervisor Scott Haggerty . ""Property Assessed Clean Energy programs, such as HERO, benefit the entire community by protecting the environment, creating jobs, and advancing a clean energy economy."" 

As California's drought drags on, eligible retrofits give homeowners a fast, affordable way to lower water bills and conserve a desperately-needed resource. HERO has a wide variety of products to help homeowners save water, including high-efficiency toilets, faucets and showerheads; drip irrigation systems; rainwater catchment systems; gray water systems; and artificial turf and other drought-tolerant landscaping.  Given the State of California's newly-adopted regulations aimed at reducing urban water consumption by 25 percent, PACE financing is becoming a particularly appealing option for homeowners looking to conserve water in their yards and homes. 

A wide variety of energy-saving products are available through HERO as well, including solar panel installations, whole-home heating and cooling systems, energy-saving windows and doors, roofing and insulation. 

""Californians are changing our ongoing attitude and relationship to water as a result of the drought,"" said Yolo County Board of Supervisors Chair Matt Rexroad . ""HERO can help us change our homes to meet these changing conditions as well."" 

HERO has helped fund more than 43,000 residential efficiency projects totaling more than $877 million in financing in California . By stimulating home renovation activity, the HERO Program increases demand for local contractor services. HERO is estimated to have spurred the creation of more than 7,400 jobs in California since beginning in December 2011 . Cities and counties benefit through economic stimulus and local job growth while helping their communities reach state-imposed water and energy savings goals. 

""This is a great opportunity for homeowners who want to go solar, or install other efficiency products, but who couldn't previously finance the up-front costs."" said Blair McNeill , Vice President of Community Development for Renovate America, the company that administers the HERO Program. ""With HERO these up-front financing barriers are removed."" 

HERO's ongoing contribution to the environment is significant and growing daily.  Water-efficiency projects that HERO has helped finance to date will save 1.4 billion gallons of water, or the equivalent of 44 million showers. An estimated 5.7 billion kWhs of energy are already being saved by projects completed to date.  This is equivalent to the CO2 emissions from 35,000 homes' energy use for a year. 

HERO's consumer protection policy sets the industry standard for PACE financing, and offers more consumer protections than any kind of lending for home improvements, such as credit cards, HELOCs or other consumer loans. HERO requires contractors to: be licensed with the state, insured, and in good standing with HERO; obtain all required permits; meet fair pricing standards; and use products certified as energy efficient by the U.S. Department of Energy or water conserving by the Environmental Protection Agency. HERO-qualified contractors undergo extensive training aimed at ensuring customers are fully informed about the costs and benefits of the HERO Program. Finally, contractors are paid only when the homeowner signs off that the job has been successfully completed. HERO also staffs a hotline to respond to homeowner queries: 800-720-HERO. 

Cities and counties need only pass a resolution to make PACE programs like HERO available to local property owners. The HERO Program has received numerous awards, including the Governor's Environmental and Economic Leadership Award, the Urban Land Institute Best of the Best and the Southern California Association of Governments President's Award for Excellence. Taking part in HERO is 100 percent voluntary for both jurisdictions and property owners. PACE financing is cost neutral to participating local governments. 

To learn more about the HERO Financing Program, and to apply, property owners can visit www.HEROProgram.com or call 855-HERO-411  (855-437-6411 ).

2105,"Stock Symbol: AEM (NYSE and TSX) The Company last reported drill results from El Barqueno in its news release dated June 9, 2015. 

At Creston Mascota and the La India mine, ongoing infill drilling and the refinement of geological and metallurgical models are expected to result in an expansion of the mineral reserves and mineral resources at both open pit operations. ""Drilling at El Barqueno continues to expand the known deposits, and we are aiming to declare the first resource by mid-February 2016. 

Summer Drill Program Expands Known Deposits at El Barqueno 

Agnico Eagle has a 100% interest in the El Barqueno project. The 32,840-hectare property is in the Guachinango 

[link to El Barqueno project location] 

The El Barqueno project contains a number of known mineralized zones and several prospects that require further evaluation. There are currently 10 drill rigs operating on the project. From January 2015 

Approximately 32,000 metres of additional drilling is expected to be completed by the end of 2015, principally at the Azteca-Zapoteca, Angostura

Azteca-Zapoteca prospect 

To date, the Azteca-Zapoteca prospect has been defined over more than 1.2 kilometres of strike length along a northeastern direction and has been intersected as deep as 300 metres, which is 100 metres deeper than previously reported. The prospect remains open at depth and along strike. Much of the planned exploration drilling for this year is done, and infill drilling has commenced and is expected to be completed in the early part of 2016. 

The mineralization appears to form a shallow to moderately dipping arc, ranging from a southwest plunge in the southwest portion, to a northeast plunge in the northeast portion. Two structures (Azteca and Zapoteca) appear to coalesce at a depth of 100 metres below surface into an almost vertical structure with higher grades than the separate zones. 

On the northeast side of the prospect, high grades were encountered both at depth and near surface. The deepest intercept to date from the 2015 drill program in this area of the prospect was hole BRQ15-174 that yielded 8.04 g/t gold, 41.9 g/t silver and 3.83% copper over 5.0 metres at 227 metres depth. Shallow intercepts included hole BRQ15-187 that yielded 5.82 g/t gold, 5.0 g/t silver and 0.01% copper over 4.9 metres at 8 metres depth, while BRQ15-185 yielded 4.84 g/t gold, 5.1 g/t silver and 0.03% copper over 9.8 metres at 33 metres depth, and hole BRQ15-180 yielded 4.51 g/t gold, 5.9 g/t silver and 0.14% copper over 11.0 metres at 13 metres depth. At mid-depth was hole BRQ15-166 that intersected 1.29 g/t gold, 9.7 g/t silver and 0.64% copper over 7.6 metres at 145 metres depth including 2.22 g/t gold, 11.6 g/t silver and 0.62% copper over 3.4 metres. 

In the southwest portion of the prospect, which has had little previous drilling, the recent intercepts were between approximately 100 and 300 metres depth. Hole BRQ15-226 intersected four lenses between 173 and 303 metres depth including 2.25 g/t gold, 15.7 g/t silver and 0.75% copper over 3.6 metres at 303 metres below surface. Nearby, hole BRQ15-203 intersected 2.18 g/t gold, 16.1 g/t silver and 0.79% copper over 6.4 metres at 128 metres below surface including 3.98 g/t gold, 21.9 g/t silver and 1.27% copper over 3.0 metres. The location of the drill hole collars is shown on the Azteca-Zapoteca and Angostura 

Drilling to date suggests this prospect has the greatest potential for near-term gold resources at the El Barqueno project. Additional drilling is required along strike to the northeast and southwest to better define the extent and geometry of the mineralized zone, to search for other potential moderately plunging shoots, and to test for higher-grade feeder zones in the southwest portion of the prospect as part of an underground mine target. There is excellent potential for parallel mineralized structures between Azteca-Zapoteca and Angostura

Four recent holes tested the area beneath the younger basalt cap, including hole BRQ15-206 that intersected 15.49 g/t gold, 11.8 g/t silver and 0.03% copper over 3.0 metres at 87 metres below surface. Another hole that drilled through the basalt cap, BRQ15-227, is approximately 100 metres farther west than any other holes in Angostura 

Drilling to date suggests Angostura 

Peña de Oro 

The Peña de Oro 

A large part of this year's planned drill program at Peña de Oro 

Hole PDO15-086 near the centre of the prospect intersected 2.69 g/t gold, 1.5 g/t silver and 0.04% copper over 27.5 metres at surface, suggesting that the zone is wide in this area. The highest grade results in the current drilling were in hole BRQ15-172 that intersected 10.82 g/t gold, 2.5 g/t silver and 0.02% copper over 4.9 metres at 32 metres below surface; this hole is approximately 65 metres southwest of any previous drilling. 

Two other recent intercepts extended the prospect farther to the south and west. With a collar located 200 metres west-southwest of hole BRQ15-172, hole BRQ15-188 intersected 3.22 g/t gold, 4.5 g/t silver and 0.04% copper over 5.9 metres at 132 metres below surface. Between holes BRQ15-172 and BRQ15-188, but farther south, hole BRQ15-210 intersected 1.83 g/t gold, 1.2 g/t silver and 0.05% copper over 4.9 metres at 167 metres below surface. The location of the drill hole collars is shown on the Peña de Oro 

The current drilling is testing an extension to the southwest and at depth. Additional drilling is required along strike to the northeast searching for other potential shallowly-plunging shoots. As well, recent mapping and sampling suggest that there is excellent potential for parallel mineralized structures to the north and northeast, such as at Peña Blanca. Potential mineralization needs to be investigated in the hanging wall (to the south) and the footwall (to the north) as well as at depth (potential feeder zones).

Zapote-Mixteca prospect 

Approximately 1 kilometre east of Azteca-Zapoteca is the Zapote-Mixteca (formerly ""Zapote"" and ""Poncho West"") prospect consisting of northeast-striking veins. A small exploration drill program of 13 holes (2,800 metres) is underway in order to confirm the subsurface extents of the alteration and mineralization noted at surface as well as the encouraging sampling results. The results from initial drill-testing in this area are expected in the coming weeks. 

Surface Mapping and Sampling Program 

Mapping and sampling is being done in select areas on the El Barqueno property including in the Tarasca, Huichol (La Luz 

The results of recent trenching at the Tarasca (formerly ""Falco"") area include 5.0 metres grading 0.70 g/t gold, 10.5 g/t silver and 0.14% copper. Another trench 130 metres to the east yielded 3.0 metres grading 3.81 g/t gold, 63.4 g/t silver and 0.67% copper. A third trench 1.7 kilometres to the east-northeast of the first trench yielded 3.0 metres grading 10.40 g/t gold, 28.6 g/t silver and 0.10% copper. 

While detailed mapping is being carried out at Olmeca, trench sampling has yielded encouraging results including 4.0 metres grading 5.72 g/t gold; approximately 600 metres to the west, a separate trench yielded 3.0 metres grading 3.44 g/t gold. 

Additional Work 

A mineralogical study indicates that the gold and silver at El Barqueno occurs as electrum. Recent analysis of 79 samples at the KCA laboratory in Reno, Nevada 

Drilling will continue at El Barqueno until the end of the year. An initial inferred mineral resource estimate is expected to be completed by the end of the year for the Azteca-Zapoteca, Angostura 

Conceptual design studies and additional metallurgical testing are underway at El Barqueno. The project may host gold-silver deposits that could potentially be developed into a series of open pits utilizing heap leach processing, similar to Creston Mascota and the La India 

While it is too early to estimate the extent of the mineral resources and the number of deposits with economic potential at El Barqueno, the Company already has the experience of developing cost-efficient mining operations in Mexico 

Drilling Confirms Mineralization Below Creston Mascota Pit 

As reported in the Company's July 29, 2015 

Selected recent infill drill results from the Creston Mascota deposit

[Creston Mascota composite cross section] 

The infill drilling has revealed higher grades and/or longer intercepts than expected, with some intercepts outside the block model but within the ultimate pit outline. In the north-central part of the pit, hole CM15-452 intersected 4.15 g/t gold and 29.6 g/t silver over 23.0 metres at 42 metres below surface, including 5.82 g/t gold and 44.1 g/t silver over 10.0 metres. This intercept is shown in the Creston Mascota cross section. 

About 570 metres farther south, in the south end of the pit, hole CM15-453 intersected 4.44 g/t gold and 47.6 g/t silver over 10.0 metres almost at surface, while nearby hole CM15-451 intersected 3.00 g/t gold and 50.5 g/t silver over 9.0 metres at 15 metres below surface. These results are expected to increase both the tonnage and the grade of the deposit's mineral reserves. 

Over its mine life, Creston Mascota has succeeded in adding approximately 50% (179,000 ounces of contained gold) to its mineral reserves through infill drilling and improved geological understanding. When the project was given the development go-ahead in mid-2009, it was estimated to have mineral reserves of 6.7 million tonnes grading 1.65 g/t gold (containing 357,000 ounces gold). By year-end 2014, Creston Mascota had mineral reserves of 5.8 million tonnes grading 1.25 g/t gold (containing 235,800 ounces of gold), as described in the Company's news release dated April 30, 2015. 

The results of recent infill drilling in the pit and the potential of nearby satellite deposits could extend the life of the Creston Mascota operations beyond 2018.

Such forward-looking statements reflect the Company's views as at the date of this document and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements and information. Many factors, known and unknown could cause the actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such risks include, but are not limited to: the volatility of prices of gold and other metals; uncertainty of mineral grades; cost of exploration and development programs; governmental and environmental regulation; and the volatility of the Company's stock price. The material factors and assumptions used in the preparation of the forward-looking statements contained herein, which may prove to be incorrect, include, but are not limited to, the assumptions set forth herein and in management's discussion and analysis (""MD&A"") and the Company's Annual Information Form (""AIF"") for the year ended December 31, 2014 

For a more detailed discussion of such risks and other factors that may affect the Company's ability to achieve the expectations set forth in the forward-looking statements contained in this document, see the Company's AIF, MD&A and Form 40-F, as well as the Company's other filings with the Canadian securities regulators and the SEC. The Company does not intend, and does not assume any obligation, to update these forward-looking statements and information other than as required by law. For a detailed breakdown of the Company's reserve and resource position see the Company's Annual Information Form or Form 40-F. 

Notes to Investors Regarding the Use of Resources Cautionary Note to Investors Concerning Estimates of Measured and Indicated Resources This document uses the terms ""measured resources"" and ""indicated resources"". Investors are advised that while those terms are recognized and required by Canadian regulations, the SEC does not recognize them. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into reserves. Cautionary Note to Investors Concerning Estimates of Inferred Resources This document also uses the term ""inferred resources"". Investors are advised that while this term is recognized and required by Canadian regulations, the SEC does not recognize it. ""Inferred resources"" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. Investors are cautioned not to assume that part or all of an inferred resource exists, or is economically or legally mineable. Scientific and Technical Disclosure 

Cautionary Note To U.S. Investors - The SEC permits U.S. mining companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only those mineral deposits that a company can economically and legally extract or produce. Agnico Eagle reports mineral resource and reserve estimates in accordance with the CIM guidelines for the estimation, classification and reporting of resources and reserves in accordance with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities' (the ""CSA"") National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (""NI 43-101""). These standards are similar to those used by the SEC's Industry Guide No. 7, as interpreted by Staff at the SEC (""Guide 7""). However, the definitions in NI 43-101 differ in certain respects from those under Guide 7. Accordingly, mineral reserve information contained herein may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by U.S. companies. Under the requirements of the SEC, mineralization may not be classified as a ""reserve"" unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. A ""final"" or ""bankable"" feasibility study is required to meet the requirements to designate reserves under Industry Guide 7. Agnico Eagle uses certain terms in this news release, such as ""measured"", ""indicated"", and ""inferred"", and ""resources"" that the SEC guidelines strictly prohibit U.S. registered companies from including in their filings with the SEC. 

Prior to 2013, mineral reserves and mineral resources for all properties were typically estimated using historic three-year average metals prices and foreign exchange rates in accordance with the SEC guidelines. These guidelines require the use of prices that reflect current economic conditions at the time of reserve determination, which the Staff of the SEC has interpreted to mean historic three-year average prices. Given the current lower commodity price environment, Agnico Eagle has decided to use price assumptions that are below the three-year averages. The assumptions used for the mineral reserves and mineral resources reported by the Company on April 30, 2015 

NI 43-101 requires mining companies to disclose reserves and resources using the subcategories of ""proven"" reserves, ""probable"" reserves, ""measured"" resources, ""indicated"" resources and ""inferred"" resources. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. 

A mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured and/or indicated mineral resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined or extracted and is defined by studies at pre-feasibility or feasibility level as appropriate that include application of modifying factors. Such studies demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, extraction could reasonably be justified. 

Modifying factors are considerations used to convert mineral resources to mineral reserves. These include, but are not restricted to, mining, processing, metallurgical, infrastructure, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. 

A proven mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource. A proven mineral reserve implies a high degree of confidence in the modifying factors. A probable mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of an indicated and, in some circumstances, a measured mineral resource. The confidence in the modifying factors applying to a probable mineral reserve is lower than that applying to a proven mineral reserve. 

A mineral resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade or quality, continuity and other geological characteristics of a mineral resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling. 

A measured mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the application of modifying factors to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to confirm geological and grade or quality continuity between points of observation. An indicated mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the application of modifying factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from adequately detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to assume geological and grade or quality continuity between points of observation. An inferred mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. Geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality continuity. 

Investors are cautioned not to assume that part or all of an inferred resource exists, or is economically or legally mineable. A feasibility study is a comprehensive technical and economic study of the selected development option for a mineral project that includes appropriately detailed assessments of applicable modifying factors together with any other relevant operational factors and detailed financial analysis that are necessary to demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that extraction is reasonably justified (economically mineable). The results of the study may reasonably serve as the basis for a final decision by a proponent or financial institution to proceed with, or finance, the development of the project. The confidence level of the study will be higher than that of a pre-feasibility study.

1742,"(September 24, 2015) PROVINCETOWN, Mass., Sept. 24, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Roux Provincetown, a lovingly restored Victorian bed and breakfast located in Provincetown's East End Gallery District and a 2015 Best of Boston recipient, today announced that in celebration of Women's Week (October 12th – 18th) it will sponsor a daily pick-up basketball game during the week-long event. Each afternoon, Roux's owners Ilene Mitnick and Alli Baldwin will lace up their Chuck Taylors, hit the newly-renovated basketball court across the street (Bradford Street) and host informal games. But it's more than just about the game. Women's Week creates a platform for thousands of women to connect. ""We want to give them a reason to head East and introduce the amazing galleries, restaurants and shops in the less traveled East End neighborhood,"" Baldwin said. This is just one of the game changers that the two latest members of the exclusive Women Innkeepers of Provincetown are bringing to their new bed and breakfast that recently celebrated its one-year anniversary and its first season with the organization. ""Ilene and Alli are our newest members, and they have offered us tremendous energy, new ideas and a delightful flair for innkeeping and for life,"" said Lynn Mogell of the Women Innkeepers of Provincetown.

It's that delightful flair that has left top celebrities and artists including Jennifer Holiday, Jennifer Coolidge, Cherry Jones and Sandra Bernhard fans of Roux and its vision.

""Roux is classy. It's beautiful. It's a getaway. They make a breakfast that will blow your mind,"" Bernhard said. ""Alli and Ilene have really separated themselves from everybody else,"" she added. According to guest reviews, nothing at Roux is ever normal or predictable, and that was exactly the vibe that Baldwin and Mitnick were seeking as they worked to create a highly curated, customized experience for their guests.

The Inn's name derives from the classic French base of flour and butter - everything starts with a roux. However, for Baldwin and Mitnick- who have a love of all things French and a focus on culinary experiences- Roux became the perfect metaphor for the experience they hoped their guests would find. ""Roux provides a blank canvas where guests create their own experience during vacation, but hopefully in life, too,"" Baldwin said. ""Things start when you're on vacation,"" she added.

With nearly 6,000 women coming to town for the week-long legacy that is Women's Week, Baldwin and Mitnick expect a full and vibrant house and look forward to discovering new and creative ways to make this 31-year old event even more spectacular.

""We wanted to host something new for Women's Week. The excitement and grit of a pick-up basketball game just adds to the street cred already resident in our beautiful East End neighborhood,"" said Mitnick.

About Roux Provincetown:

Roux Provincetown is a unique bed and breakfast in the heart of Provincetown, Massachusetts whose owners share a love of art, music, and cuisine. After a 4-month and 11-day renovation, the inn – a beautiful Victorian house- opened its doors July 11, 2014. Roux was awarded Boston Magazine's Best of Boston title for 2015 Best Inn on Cape Cod, and is consistently ranked among the top five Provincetown B &Bs on Trip Advisor.

1635,"Looking high in the northeast after darkness falls, the glittering stars of the “BIG W” shine forth. No, not a neon sign for a chain department store. This is the constellation Cassiopeia, whose five principal stars wonderfully form the letter “W.” Of course it depends on orientation. Sometimes it appears like an “M.” While the constellation is rising in the northeast, the “W” is more on its side. In early September around 1 a.m., it is high up in the north, perhaps straight overhead where you live. It is then shaped like an “M.” Twelve hours later, the constellation is at its low point, and appears as a true “W.” At this time of year, that is close to 1 in the afternoon. The “W” is there, just like all the rest of the stars, but you won’t see it in broad daylight. The only star you can see by day is the Sun! Like all constellations, Cassiopeia seems to circle around an imaginary point on the sky next to the North Star. Directly opposite from Cassiopeia on the other side of the North Star is the famed seven stars of the Big Dipper. The Earth’s rotation, of course, makes the sky seems to spin around. As we advance towards new moon on Sept. 13, we can enjoy moonless nights, and the maaximum amount of stars you can see. Cassiopeia is amidst the hazy glow of the Milky Way Band which at this time of year in the evening extends across the sky and down in the south. The view with eyes alone is spectacular enough, but just try it with binoculars! With binoculars, scan the stars the next September evening just below the “W” on its side. Look below the “W”’s bottom segment, by a little more than the length of that segment. You should quickly be able to spot the “Double Cluster,” a pair of open star clusters of similar brightness and size. With unaided eyes under a dark sky you can see the Double Cluster as a small pair of fuzzy patches. Binoculars will begin to reveal the myriad stars in each cluster. The view in a small telescope at low power is stunning. The planet Saturn may be currently seen low in the southwest once darkness falls, appearing like a bright star. If you arise early (or stay up very late), look low in the eastern sky about an hour before sunrise. Venus is very bright. To the upper left is the planet Mars, much dimmer and reddish. Be sure to look on the mornings of Sept. 9, 10 and 11, should skies be clear. The crescent moon will be gliding between Venus and Mars. Mark your calendar: North America is favored by a total lunar eclipse on Sunday evening Sept. 27! An upcoming column will discuss this further. Keep looking up! Peter W.

418,"Hi Dr. Chris Teo,

Good day to you! I've got the link of your website from a good friend of mine in the beginning of the year. At that time, my uncle was diagnosed with pancreas cancer stage 2. My uncle and his family members decided to take the advice from the attending doctor to do chemotherapy. He had since gone through a series of chemotherapy and further extended to radiotherapy.

Last month, my uncle was admitted to hospital due to severe sore throat, which believed to be the side effect of radiotherapy and continued to be warded until today. His health condition did not get better but deteriorated since hospitalization. 3 weeks after hospitalization, the attending doctor suddenly broke the news to my aunt and cousins that my uncle was diagnosed with liver cancer stage 4 and announced that he is left with 2 months of life. It was devastating as we all thought my uncle was actually recuperating. He is now very weak and bedridden.

I had passed your contact to my cousin early of the year and until today she didn't make that move to contact you. It seems to me that they are losing faith and giving up hopes. I'm writing this letter to seek for your professional advice as in what can I do to help my uncle or his family members?

Looking forward to hear from you soon. Your kind advice would be very much appreciated.

Thanks and best regards.

1674,"OTTAWA - Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, taking the offensive after an election campaign marred by setbacks and missteps, on Thursday said his rivals would badly damage the economy if they took power. 
 
With polls showing a tight three-way race ahead of the Oct. 19 vote, Harper needs to break away from his two centre-left opponents if his right-leaning Conservatives are to have any chance of extending their near 10-year term in office. 
 
Harper has long portrayed himself as the only leader able to handle a sluggish economy amid global weakness. This week trumpeted the fact the federal budget had returned to surplus a year earlier than predicted. 
 
""The other parties are trying to tell us they will deal with the challenges of our economy, of our labor market, of international markets, by raising taxes and running deficits to finance vastly increased amounts of spending,"" he told a televised debate about the economy. 
 
""That is not the way to protect our economy in this environment,"" he said in often testy exchanges with New Democratic Party leader Thomas Mulcair, 60, and Liberal leader Justin Trudeau, 43. 
 
Harper says Canada should stick to Conservative policies designed to keep taxes low and attract investment. He brushes off calls for more government spending. 
 
The Liberals are proposing to run budget deficits for three years to help finance a major national infrastructure program. 
 
""Mr Harper wants to hit the snooze button while Mr Trudeau is hitting the panic button,"" said Mulcair. His party - which has never held power federally - said this week it would raise the corporate tax rate.. 
 
The debate, the second of the campaign, was sponsored by the Globe and Mail newspaper. 
 
It took place in Harper's adopted hometown of Calgary in the western energy-producing province of Alberta, which has been hard hit by slumping crude prices. 
 
Mulcair accused Harper of relying far too much on oil exports to buoy government finances. The price of crude has dropped by more than half since mid-2014. 
 
""Mr. Harper put all his eggs in one basket and then he dropped the basket,"" he said. 
 
Trudeau said Harper had presided over the worst growth rate of any prime minister since the Great Depression. 
 
""Canadians are worried about their jobs, and that's what this election is about,"" said Trudeau. 
 
Green Party leader Elizabeth May, who performed well in the first televised encounter, was left off the roster and could only offer commentary on Twitter.",37e9ef55-dfe6-47e6-9e47-6711675323d8,News,2015-09-18T01:41:54Z,Kingston Whig-Standard,Stephen Harper bashes rivals over economy at second leaders' debate,0.0,News

Ten-year-old K. Tejasri who recovered after undergoing 10 surgeries in Andhra Hospitals in Vijayawada. —Photo: V. Raju 

Ten-year-old Tejasri got into RTC bus on May 16 not knowing that she was embarking on a trip to hell. 

It was her own spirit and the assistance of several organisations that brought her back. 

The bus collided with another near Kondapalli and several passengers were hurt. But Tejasri’s injuries were horrendous. 

Trauma section 

When she was wheeled into the trauma section of Andhra Hospitals, her case did not offer much hope. 

There was a bleed in her brain. Her chest had been crushed and several ribs were broken. 

There were injuries in her stomach and one leg was crushed. 

Over the next six weeks, she had to undergo 10 procedures, including a brain surgery. 

Ventilator 

She endured six weeks under a ventilator and for several more weeks, oxygen was supplied to her windpipe through a hole in her neck. Paediatric intensive care specialist P.V. Rama Rao said at a press conference at Andhra Hospital on Saturday that a surgery had to be performed within a couple of days to plug the bleed in the brain. A second operation was performed on the chest, a third on the abdomen and six more on the limbs to fix several fractures. 

Artificial leg 

Hundred days after the accident, doctors finally declared Tejasri out of danger. Her head injury had healed, but the leg was lost. 

She will, however, be able to walk with an artificial leg, doctors said. 

Andhra Hospitals group MD P.V. Ramana Murthy said Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Managing Director N. Sambasiva Rao visited the child in hospital the day after the accident. 

Touched by the plight of the girl, Mr Rao told the hospital not to spare any expense to save the child’s life. 

Mr Sambasiva Rao was also present at the media conference. 

Dr Ramana Murthy said RTC released Rs 10 lakh for Tejasri’s treatment. 

Minister for Major Irrigation Devineni Umamaheswara Rao visited the girl and promised all support from the government. 

Hundred days after the accident, doctors finally declare Tejasri is out of danger

I will be working with the US Soybean Export Council and Chinese pork industry people on this trip. Some of the attendees at my meetings will be producers but many will be nutritionists, technical advisors, allied industry and farm owners. 
 
As I spend 8 days traveling in China, I hope to get a sense of how extensive their sell off of breeding stock really was. Was the sale of almost 10 million sows mostly from the small back-yard traditional producer or did some/many of the newer production sites also reduce their inventory? 
 
Current reports that I’ve seen from China suggest that the local price has risen to a profitable level again so will there be talk of expansion? 
 
What about local feed grain prices? In the Mankato area corn bids are now around $3.15/bu and reports of below $3 bids are coming in from South Dakota already. Once the harvest begins and storage fills, will basis widen even more? Same thoughts for soybeans and soy meal in our region. Soybean plants that are 5-6 ft tall mean a lot of pods and with all of the rain we’re on the road to a very good harvest in the upper Midwest.

2474,"A greater share of a $50 billion submarine-building program will likely be done in Australia under a Malcolm Turnbull-led government in a major strategic and industrial shift, according to buoyant South Australian MPs. A greater share of a $50 billion submarine-building program will likely be done in Australia under a Malcolm Turnbull-led government in a major strategic and industrial shift, according to buoyant South Australian MPs. Liberal MPs who were facing electoral wipe-out under Tony Abbott in part because of the broken promise to build 12 submarines in Adelaide say they are confident Mr Turnbull is more inclined than his predecessor to build the next generation of boats locally.

""In the conversations I've had with him, Malcolm was more receptive to building as much as possible locally than the current PM,"" one South Australian Liberal said on Tuesday morning before Mr Turnbull was sworn in.

South Australian senator Sean Edwards, who extracted the pledge from Tony Abbott for a ""competitive evaluation process"" for the submarine program during the last leadership crisis in February, also expressed confidence.

""From the conversations I've had overnight, there will be more work locally and a big focus on smart industries and advanced manufacturing,"" said Senator Edwards, while stressing he had not spoken personally with Mr Turnbull.

""I've never been more confident about the process than I am today … I'd welcome Christopher Pyne because the role of defence minister is an extremely important one and Christopher has a good track record as an effective operator.""

The Department of Defence is undertaking a ""competitive evaluation process"" to assess bids by Japan, Germany and France to build the new fleet of subs.

Mr Abbott was widely regarded as having favoured a partnership with Japan, which initially meant much of the building work would likely be done in that country.

However he announced the competitive evaluation process amid fears of a major electoral backlash in South Australia because the government had made a pre-election promise to build 12 submarines in Adelaide.

A shift towards doing more building work locally should be manageable because Defence has asked the three bidding countries to prepare a range of options: building locally, building overseas, or a ""hybrid"" build partly onshore and partly offshore.

Reports emerged on Monday night that Education Minister Christopher Pyne, the most senior South Australian Liberal, would shift to the defence portfolio, all but guaranteeing a boost to local building work on the new fleet.

However government sources cast doubt on those reports and suggested Abbott-backer Kevin Andrews may remain in the portfolio.

Mr Andrews said on Tuesday he wanted to remain in the job given the major challenges still facing Defence.

""We're about to bring out a White Paper, we're in the midst of the submarine evaluation, we're in the midst of replacing the navy almost completely over the next decade or so. It takes a long time to get on top of the complexity of Defence and I would be happy to continue in this role,"" Mr Andrews told the ABC.

""I don't think it's good for the security and safety of this country and for the wellbeing of our defence forces to keep changing defence ministers.""

One perceived driver of Mr Abbott's inclination towards Japan was to build a closer strategic relationship with that country – a move that is supported by Washington.

Since then, however, Japan has largely matched Germany and France in saying it was prepared to do much of the building work in Australia. One South Australian MP said he had been ""pleasantly surprised"" by recent conversations with Japanese representatives.

In a recent video interview with London School of Business 

Participating in LSBF's Great Minds series, Mr Havelock - who joined Unilever back in 1985 - spoke of the changes the sector has gone through, and must continue to go through, in order to keep up with today's fast developing environment.

""The first big challenge is the volatile world that we live in,"" he told Nadim Choudhury 

Giving specific examples, Mr Havelock mentioned Latin America 

Unilever was formed in 1930 when British soap maker Lever Brothers and Dutch margarine producer Margarine Unie came together to form a merger. Expanding to cover over 400 brands across 190 different countries, Unilever's 2014 turnover amounted to a massive €48.4 billion.

""One of the things about being in fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) is that consumers want new things every year,"" Mr Havelock explained. ""We introduce over 1000 new products every year and spend over a billion euros a year on research development to make sure we're bringing products that are new, exciting and on trend - or even slightly ahead of the trends - so that we can bring products that they want.""

Not only does Unilever have to work hard to keep the products they sell up-to-date and on trend, but their marketing and advertising techniques, as well. Mr Havelock said: ""The world has changed dramatically in the last five years. In the past, [we would have advertised using] TV, print, and posters. Today it's all about mobile technology; making sure we provide content that gives people information and inspiration is very important.""

Throughout his three decades in the company, Mr Havelock held senior leadership positions including Chairman for Unilever UK, Unilever France and Unilever Arabia, and Chairman for Unilever's Beverages business across Europe 

Asked about any particular personal highlights, Mr Havelock identified taking Unilever's ice cream business global as a key achievement. ""We've built some really beautiful brands such as Magnum and Cornetto so I've taken quite a lot of pride in that. If you think about it, ice cream is about giving people a smile every day and that excites me and my team.""

For those interested in entering the FMCG sector, Mr Havelock believes Unilever is a great place to start. They take on 800 graduates every year, who receive on-the-ground training over a period of two or three years.

""If you're the sort of person that likes a lot of change every day, that's quite flexible, but also able to work with the analytics at the same time, FMCG is a very attractive area to come into. I think it's as exciting as it's ever been. If you're purpose driven and thinking about the planet, you'll probably want to have a good look at Unilever. It's work hard, play hard within our organisation; we expect to work hard together but also have some fun and enjoy what we're doing.""

LSBF Great Minds Series 

As well as offering programmes dedicated to fostering leadership skills, LSBF also endeavours to provide students with insight and inspiration through a number of innovative resources. One of these initiatives is the LSBF Great Minds Series: a collection of video interviews with leading business and political leaders promoting debate on education, employability, entrepreneurship and the economy.

The video series started in 2011 with a conversation with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, followed by an interview with former Education Secretary Lord Kenneth Baker. In 2012, entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson, founder and chairman of the Virgin Group said that universities worldwide should become hubs to boost entrepreneurship and inspire self-starters to develop their own businesses. In 2014, LSBF spoke to Will Butler-Adams from Brompton Bicycle, Guy Hayward-Cole from Nomura Bank International, with former British Prime Minister Sir John Major, entrepreneur and investor Deborah Meaden, Google UK sales director Kevin Mathers and BBC Worldwide CEO Tim Davie.

Kicking off 2015, LSBF hosted interviews with Andrew Miller, CEO of Guardian Media Group; Jill McDonald, CEO of McDonald's UK; Kevin Costello, CEO of Haymarket Group; Amy McPherson, CEO of Marriott Hotels Europe; veteran BAFTA-winning broadcaster Jon Snow

With the Dark Descent-bound release of Aeons In Tectonic Interment , the long-awaited new full-length from Finnish funeral doom duo, TYRANNY , now less than two weeks away, today the gloom-bringers at Decibel Magazine hurl forth second movement, “A Voice Given Unto Ruin” for communal depression. 
 
TYRANNY ’s first proper recording in a decade and third overall spews forth five decaying psalms of slow, tortured, soul-consuming grimness. Composed, performed and tracked by members Matti Mäkelä and Lauri Lindqvist with additional percussion by Jussi-Pekka Manner and mastered by D. Lowndes at Resonance Sound Studio (Absu, Pallbearer, Profetus, Sigh, Wodensthrone etc.), Aeons In Tectonic Interment is a traumatic, fifty-one-minute audio apocalypse where misanthropy, suffering and imminent ruin become one achieving purification through sonic degeneration. 
 
“ Aeons In Tectonic Interment  is an imperious, ambitious listen; the ‘death’ aspect of their corroded death/doom takes the reins, allowing the doomier tempo and atmosphere to decay around it,” issues Noisey of the opus, further noting “Its graceless, lumbering pace is almost unbearably slow, adding to the tension that hangs between the ringing notes and the pregnant pauses before each drawn-out roars erupts.” Elsewhere Decibel Magazine notes, “ TYRANNY have chosen to play all their music in the key of crushing.” Glacially Musical concurs, “The ringing, sludgy chords, the forlorn vocals, the wisps of melody, it all adds up to an immersing experience. TYRANNY has made a depressing, metal, vicious Pink Floyd album from their pre- Darkside Of The Moon  Era. Settle in, this ride will be long and bumpy, but worth it.” Abysmal Hymns calls the record, “heavy as fuck,” warning, “This album goes to the extreme to grind you down with its weight.” Metal Injection likens the band to the “crawl of a spider web-laden crypt, “ while We Love Metal adds, “It doesn’t get any darker than TYRANNY … The droning and depression ensuring tracks off… Aeons In Tectonic Interment cement the darkness… “ 
 Get gloomy with a helping of “A Voice Given Unto Ruin,” courtesy of Decibel Magazine at THIS LOCATION .  
And if you missed it, sample “Sunless Deluge” still streaming at Noisey at THIS LOCATION . 
 
Forged in 2001 by Mäkelä and Lindqvist, TYRANNY was conceived under the strain of a Stranger Will to channel the Ageless resonations of Earth and Oceans and sonorous visions and fevered dreams by the means of epic, Funereal Soundscapes. 
 
Aeons In Tectonic Interment will see release via Dark Descent Records on CD, double LP and digitally on September 18th, 2015. For CD preorders, point your browser HERE . For LP preorders go HERE .

1721,"Badger culls have begun in Dorset and are continuing in other parts of England, despite a call from Queen guitarist and campaigner Brian May for them to stop while he seeks a judicial review. 
 
The Government's decision to extend the cull of badgers was announced last week, and the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has now confirmed the culls have begun. 
 
Natural England authorised a four-year licence for Dorset, where between 615 and 835 badgers are due to be killed over a six-week period this year, alongside the third of four years of culling in Gloucester and Somerset. 
 
A spokeswoman for Defra said: ""The culling activity is now under way in Dorset, Somerset and Gloucestershire."" 
 
Animal rights groups have voiced their anger over the move, pointing to an independent expert panel's findings that the trials had proved neither humane nor effective and should be halted. 
 
Speaking last week Dr May, who founded the animal charity Save Me Trust, said: ""The Government should quit now, and save the taxpayer more fruitless expense. 
 
""This is a tragedy for our farmers, cattle and wildlife. The scientific advice has been ignored by ministers with more badgers set to die again this year."" 
 
Farming minister George Eustice said ""strong action"" was needed to protect the dairy and beef industry by controlling the spread of TB in cattle, claiming the support of ""leading vets"" for the culling policy. 
 
And farmers' leaders said they were disappointed the cull had not been extended to other areas. 
   
 Share article  
   
Figures released earlier this week showed culling badgers has cost the taxpayer £16.8 million in the past few years, or £6,775 for each animal killed. 
 
The costs were revealed by Defra in response to a Freedom of Information request by the Badger Trust, who said the figures show the policy is an ""unacceptable burden on the taxpayer"".",cc075a78-8516-4f3e-b0b9-11c47c82e83d,News,2015-09-04T07:05:16Z,Durham Times,Badger culls begin in Dorset despite opposition from animal rights groups,0.0,News
2352,"Yesterday was an exciting day for our company, as we celebrated the official start to the construction of our new company headquarters, which will be located in North Stonington, Connecticut. Although jovial founder, Carla, has had this piece of property near and dear to her heart for many years, her family became the official owners about six months ago. “I used to come here for dinner with my family and it has always been a dream of mine to someday own this beautiful and historic land,” Bartolucci said. 
 

Along with revealing the plans for the new jovial warehouse and administrative building, Carla also took the time to thank the many people who helped her dream come to fruition.  This included the  project’s architect, Friedrich St. Florian, whose very prestigious resume includes designing the WWII Memorial in Washington, DC.  Frederich explained that after spending time with Carla in Italy to discuss plans and then walking the site together in Connecticut, he was able to fully appreciate the vision that Carla had for the John Randall homestead. He knew she was the perfect person to bring the inspiring piece of property back to life and back to it’s full potential. 
 

 
Randall’s Ordinary is anything but ordinary, built circa 1685, the house is on the National Register of Historic Places and one of North Stonington’s most famous sites.  In her speech on Thursday, Carla explained that she holds the property dear to her heart and although changes will be made, the historic integrity of the land will be honored and respected completely. She also added that the Randall homestead is the perfect place for jovial’s mission to unfold, looking to the past for a better future. 
 
State Representative Diana Urban and First Selectman Nick Mullane were also there to join Carla, her family, Fredrich and John Carlin of Carlin Construction Company in the first official dig.  The concrete work will commence as early as November, and the grand opening of the office and warehouse will be in the early summer of 2016.  Following the company relocation, work will begin to restore the inn so that Carla can begin her Culinary Getaways in Connecticut. The inn was originally constructed in an Old World barn that was transported to the site from upstate New York. The beautiful timber frame structure will house 10 guest rooms, and jovial will be building an additional that will include a large kitchen, dining area, and an outdoor courtyard. Following completion of the inn renovation, the company will set it’s sites toward the 1685 home and adjacent barn. 
 

 
To celebrate the release of her new cookbook, Einkorn: Recipes for Nature’s Original Wheat , Carla prepared a selection of 10 savory and sweet recipes to serve after the ceremonies.  Carla told the story of the company beginnings and how much it means to her to meet her customers face-to-face at the villa in Italy and how excited she is to do the same in Connecticut. She concluded her speech by inviting people to try einkorn: “I wanted to tell you that I baked for you. How many people here have tasted einkorn? Well, today, you are going to taste the oldest food that there is.” 
 

 

 
Following the ceremony Carla and all those who helped make her dream happen, gathered under the tent and together celebrated the next chapter for North Stonington and, of course, Jovial Foods. It was a great way to end an exciting evening.

4773,"CS Vikas Gupta What is Secretarial Audit? Secretarial Audit is a process to check compliance with the provisions of various laws and rules/regulations/procedures, maintenance of books, records etc., by an independent professional to ensure that the company has complied with the legal and procedural requirements and also followed due processes. It is essentially a mechanism to monitor compliance with the requirements of stated laws and processes. Which companies are required to undergo Secretarial Audit? As per section 204(1) of Companies Act, 2013 read with rule 9 of the Companies (Appointment and Remuneration of Managerial Personnel) Rules, 2014, the following companies are required to obtain Secretarial Audit Report: – Every listed company; or Every public company having a paid-up share capital of fifty crore rupees or more; or Every public company* having a turnover of two hundred fifty crore rupees or more. *Public Company includes a private company which is a subsidiary of a public company. (My view: However, it is recommended that it should be adopted voluntarily. It can be an effective multi-pronged weapon to assure the regulator, generate confidence amongst the shareholders, the creditors and other stakeholders in companies, assure FIIs/FIs/SFCs/SIDCs/Banks and instill self regulation and professional discipline in companies. It is a tool of risk mitigation and will allow companies to effectively address compliance risk issues. It helps the companies to build their corporate image. Secretarial Audit thus provides necessary comfort to the management, regulators and the stakeholders, as to the statutory compliance, good governance and the existence of proper and adequate systems and processes.) Who can conduct Secretarial Audit? Only a member of the Institute of Company Secretaries of India holding certificate of practice (company secretary in practice) can conduct Secretarial Audit and furnish the Secretarial Audit Report to the company. [Section 204(1) of Companies Act, 2013] How is the Secretarial Auditor appointed? As per Rule 8 of the Companies (Meetings of Board and its powers) Rules, 2014, Secretarial Auditor is required to be appointed by means of resolution passed at a duly convened Board meeting. What is periodicity of Secretarial Audit? Proactive Secretarial Audit on a continuous basis would help the company in initiating corrective measures and strengthening its compliance mechanism and processes. It is therefore, advisable that the Secretarial Audit is carried out periodically (quarterly / half year / annually) and adverse finding if any, is reported on interim basis to the Board immediately. The Secretarial Audit Report to be annexed with Board’s report is required to be submitted before the preparation of Board’s Report. What are the laws which need to be examined while conducting the Secretarial Audit? The Secretarial Auditor needs to examine and report on the compliance of the following laws: (i) The Companies Act, 2013 (the Act) and the rules made thereunder; (ii) The Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (“SCRA”) and the rules made thereunder; (iii) The Depositories Act, 1996 and the Regulations and Bye-laws framed thereunder; (iv) Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 and the rules and regulations made thereunder to the extent of Foreign Direct Investment, Overseas Direct Investment and External Commercial Borrowings; (v) The following Regulations and Guidelines prescribed under the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (“SEBI Act”):- (a) The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011; (b) The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992; (c) The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009; (d) The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Employee Stock Option Scheme and Employee Stock Purchase Scheme) Guidelines, 1999; (e) The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations, 2008; (f) The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Registrars to an Issue and Share Transfer Agents) Regulations, 1993 regarding the Companies Act and dealing with client; (g) The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009; and (h) The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Buyback of Securities) Regulations, 1998; (vi) Secretarial Standards issued by The Institute of Company Secretaries of India and approved by the Central Government.

3613,"The logo of U.S. mobile network operator Sprint Corp is seen at a Sprint store in San Marcos, California August 3, 2015.  Reuters/Mike Blake    
Sprint Corp ( S.N ) could be stronger if merged with a cable company, the U.S wireless company's chief executive said on Thursday, adding that he was not engaged in any such merger talks. 

Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure made the comments to Reuters when asked about brisk acquisition activity in the cable and telecommunications sector and the recent entry of Europe's Altice NV ( ATCA.AS ), founded by French-Israeli billionaire Patrick Drahi, that has agreed to buy U.S. cable companies Cablevision Systems Corp ( CVC.N )  and Suddenlink Communications. 

Combining Sprint with a cable company would make “us a stronger and more formidable competitor,"" Claure said in an interview. ""But there’s absolutely no discussion.” 

Drahi, speaking last week at a conference in New York, said that he could buy a U.S. wireless carrier ""someday."" Altice executives have said they hope to offer U.S. subscribers a ""quadruple play"" of Internet, television, and fixed and mobile telecoms. 
 
Claure said he had read about the comments. 

""It seems like everybody now wants to get into wireless which puts Sprint in a very good position. So I think the next few months or years are going to be very active in this industry."" Claure said. ""I think it’s going to be exciting times ahead in terms of consolidation but we don’t have any conversations with anybody.” 
 
Sprint burned $2.2 billion in cash in the second quarter ended June 30. It is locked in an aggressive price war with its rivals Verizon Communications Inc( VZ.N ) , AT&T Inc ( T.N ) and T-Mobile US Inc ( TMUS.N )  which are going after each others' subscribers with promotions that have weighed on growth. 

In August, Japan's SoftBank Group Corp( 9984.T ), the majority owner of Sprint, raised its stake in the wireless company to 82 percent from about 80 percent through a share purchase, boosting the market value of the struggling U.S. wireless carrier. It is also setting up two financing vehicles to help Sprint reverse its fortunes. 
 
The company has been under pressure to cut costs because of investor concerns it was spending too much to acquire and retain customers and build out its wireless network. 

Shares in Sprint were little changed at $4.39 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday afternoon.

AUSTRALIA Post worker Steve Hodge had a long history of mental health issues before he was shot dead by police after lunging at officers with a large knife in front of horrified shoppers. 


An  investigation was under way on Wednesday night after officers shot Mr Hodge at least three times when the confrontation outside the Warners Bay post office where he had worked for years turned deadly. 
CONTENT WARNING: GRAPHIC FOOTAGE 
Australia Post released a statement on Thursday morning regarding the shooting of long-term employee Steve Hodge by police outside its Warners Bay post office. 

‘‘We are saddened by the loss of a valued, long-term team member and our thoughts are with his family and colleagues,’’ the statement said. 

‘‘We will do everything we can to provide them with support at this difficult time, and we are providing counselling services to our staff and customers. 

 ‘‘Nothing is more important to Australia Post than the safety of our people and we will work with relevant authorities to thoroughly investigate all aspects of this tragic event.’’ 

A harrowing video showing Mr Hodge’s final moments will become the centre of the homicide squad-run investigation. 


In the video,   police are clearly heard  warning the troubled man several times before he runs  towards one of the officers who is  standing with his gun drawn. 


The shooting occurred in front of dozens of stunned shoppers beside a car park known as Postmans Lane about 3.15pm after police were called after  reports of  a man  wielding a knife. 

Mr Hodge had been working at the post office on Wednesday before something made him begin threatening people with the knife and gesturing that he was going to cut his wrists. 

A woman, who did not want to be named, said she was standing in the car park across from the post office when she saw a man ‘‘holding a butcher’s knife to what looked like a staff member’’. 

‘‘The guy who looked like a staff member kept his distance and at one point he had to run away, he didn’t turn his back but he had to run to stop him coming towards him,’’ she said. 

She said her and a friend came across the scene and immediately called police. 

‘‘There was no one else around and my friend, who I was with, said you have to call the police,’’ she told the Newcastle Herald. 

‘‘Two guys came up and tried to stop it, they were telling the guy to put the knife down but he wouldn’t. 

‘‘He looked really distressed. One hand was holding the knife and the other was kind of covering his face. Like he had his head in his hands. But he was wearing sunglasses the whole time.’’ 

Despite some reports, shot Australia Post worker Steve Hodge had not been sacked before he lunged at police with knife @newcastleherald

The witness said  police arrived within four minutes, and fired three shots at the man when he refused to put down the knife. 

‘‘Two police officers rocked up and got out, they were holding their guns up and yelling at him to put the knife down but he still wouldn’t,’’ she said. 

‘‘Then he came at the police with the knife. He didn’t run, but he came at them, and they just shot him three times. 

A video shows two plain-clothes police officers telling the man to ‘‘put the knife on the ground’’. 

At one point an officer yells, ‘‘Put it down or we will shoot’’. 

‘‘C’mon mate, we’re not mucking around, you don’t want to do this mate,’’ one of the officers can be heard saying. 

After a short interval one of the officers then says, ‘‘Put it down mate, we’re here to help you’’. 

Mr Hodge then appears to approach one of the officers holding the knife aloft in a threatening position. 

The officer yells for him to ‘‘put it down’’ twice more before at least three gunshots are fired and the man collapses.   

Warners Bay resident Cheryl Taylor said she heard the commotion and immediately assumed it was drugs. 

‘‘[It] was a really big knife, and he appeared to be cutting his wrists or making out he was,’’ Mrs Taylor said. 

‘‘There was another man there saying, ‘Don’t do it, mate, I wouldn’t do that, mate, don’t do it’, so I got scared then and came around this side of the post office, and when I got around to here, then plain-clothes police arrived with their guns drawn. 

‘‘I heard two shots fired and that was it, that’s all I saw.’’ 

Northern Region police commander Assistant Commissioner Jeff Loy said the homicide squad would run the critical incident investigation.

‘‘At this time, we acknowledge the grief and suffering of the man’s family and also we are looking after welfare of our police and their families, but I can assure you that every aspect of this investigation will be investigated by a critical investigation team and overseen by the professional standards command,’’ Mr Loy said. 

Communications Electrical and Plumbing Union branch secretary Jim Metcher confirmed that the dead man was a member of the union. 

‘‘Despite his long history of mental health disorders that has resulted in this horrific and tragic sad circumstance, he was always held in high regard and supported by his colleagues,’’ Mr Metcher said. 

‘‘Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends along with our local retail members who have been subjected to this horrific ordeal late this afternoon.’’ 

Mr Hodge’s mother arrived at the shooting scene and was comforted by police. 

Customers told the Herald that Mr Hodge could appear odd but was always friendly. 

Ebony Holly, of Bay Arcade Dental, had worked at the practice for about two years and has visited Mr Hodge behind the counter about once a month. 

‘‘Every time I went in to see him he was lovely,’’ she said. 

‘‘He was bubbly, chirpy, always friendly and very helpful. 

‘‘I didn’t realise it was him at first. 

‘‘It’s the last thing you expect to see in Warners Bay. 

‘‘It’s quite scary and shocking this has happened here.’’ 

One man whose office backs onto the post office said Mr Hodge was a  lovely bloke who ‘‘had some issues’’. 

‘‘I’ve known him for a lot of years and he’s a lovely guy with a great sense of humour,’’ he said. 

The man, who didn’t want to give his surname but whose first name was also Steve, said he understood that Mr Hodge had been dealing with mental health issues. 

‘‘It got to the point where you wanted to have a joke lined up for when you went in to see him just to get him to smile, because he loved to have a joke,’’ the man said. 

Australia Post confirmed that a ‘‘tragic incident’’ occurred at the post office, and said it was assisting police with their investigation  as well as  providing counselling services to its employees and customers.

3152,"In the course of a year, there are special moments I anticipate for days in advance–mostly cause they involve eating. 
 
On Christmas, for instance, my family and I eat at Chinese and Indian restaurants within one glorious 24-hour cycle. 
 
For my dog, that special day is any day–like last Sunday–when my mom comes over for dinner. 
 
That’s cause my mom not so discretely feeds the dog scraps of chicken while the dog burrows into her lap from under the table. 
 
My mom’s been doing this for so many years that my dog starts salivating almost from the moment she sees my mom walking up the front steps. 
 
In fact, I believe that when my dog sees my mom, it’s not really my mom she actually sees, but a giant scrap of chicken. 
 
A thing you should know about my mom… 
 
She loves dogs. 
 
For most of her adult life she and my dad had a dog. But when the last one died about ten years ago, they concluded that–pushing 80–they were too old to take in another dog. 
 
And they’ve been without a dog ever since. 
 

 
Hey, ma–we all know what’s going on… 
 
  
 
For the longest time, I was adamant against my mom feeding scraps to the dog. 
 
I’d say things like… 
 
“Stop it, ma–you’re spoiling that dog!” 
 
Or… 
 
“C’mon, ma–we’re trying to teach that dog not to beg. You’re ruining our training!” 
 
Or… 
 
“Ma, that food’s too rich for the dog. She’s gonna get the runs!” 
 
And my mom would be a little like the Gilly character created by Kristen Wiig. She’d say, “sorry.” 
 
Then she’d go right back to feeding the dog scraps a few moments later. 
 
Well, time’s worn away my opposition to this not-so-discreet, under-the-table chicken-scrap feeding thing. 
 
So when my folks came for dinner on Sunday, I pretended not to see what was happening right in front of my eyes. 
 
I mean, really–who the hell am I to complain? 
 
The dog’s pushing 11, and my mom’s pushing 90. I say let `em enjoy this chicken-scrap feeding moment for as long as they can share it. 
 
Life is short, chicken is good. 
 
Or as someone else said about something in a similar context … 
 
I was so much older then, I’m younger than that now.",849f5e93-655e-4be7-88f9-1ddabbe37c35,Blog,2015-09-13T16:25:54Z,The Third City,Benny Jay: Don’t Feed The Dog!,1.0,Blog

3397,"Comcast challenges YouTube with Watchable video service The cable provider's new service puts digital stars side-by-side with regular TV. by Joan E. Solsman @joan_e September 29, 2015 12:40 PM PDT Updated: September 29, 2015 12:55 PM PDT Comcast launched its first streaming service that anybody can access. Reuters Cable company Comcast on Tuesday launched Watchable, a service that delivers short videos to living-room TVs, mobile devices and a Web player.
The country's biggest traditional pay-TV provider will put digital shows often associated with online video sites like Google's YouTube, including Vice, The Young Turks, Smosh, Day of Gluttony, and Clevver, on the same video platform as regular live news and sports. But you don't have to pay to watch it -- Watchable runs ads to earn revenue, rather than charging outright.
As consumers increasingly turn online for entertainment, Comcast is hoping Watchable will help keep its services relevant. Adding short videos from digital-savvy partners like AwesomenessTV, the Onion and BuzzFeed means customers will be able to flip from a traditional TV show to these short-form clips as part of a regular pay-TV package. Comcast hopes that Watchable will help it retain would-be cord-cutters -- people who drop pay-TV for online alternatives -- and that it will appeal to young, potential customers who have found their favorite performers online.
Philadelphia-based Comcast said the launch was a beta version of Watchable, which means the company is still experimenting with it. The company said it would eventually add the ability to create more personalized content and share videos with others. Watchale is available on Apple mobile devices, on the web at watchable.com and for people with a Comcast pay-TV X1 subscription.
Comcast listed partners such as digital content players such as AwesomenessTV, Buzzfeed, and Tastemade, as well as about 30 others.
The roll out comes on the heels of another video service launched by a traditional pay-TV provider: Go90 by Verizon. Unlike Watchable, Go90 will only be available on mobile devices when it launches later this week.

How to Get Away With Murder 10 p.m., ABC

I wasn’t surprised Viola Davis (above) won the Emmy for best actress in a drama on Sunday night. She’s a powerful presence, which her acceptance speech alone proved. It was a riveting moment when she took the stage and began quoting Harriet Tubman. But I do think this Shonda Rhimes show is totally hokey, with crazy histrionics and flat plot twists, and last season I found Davis’s performance on it monochromatic and — perhaps due to the silly script — kind of nonsensical. Anyhoo, “How to Get Away With Murder” returns Thursday night.

Once upon a time, NBC owned this timeslot with “ER” and, before that, “L.A. Law.” Now, the network can’t find a solid show for the slot to save its life. This feeble action effort stars Philip Winchester (left) as a former FBI operative who now is a security consultant, and Wesley Snipes (right) as the mysterious head of a mysterious organization that recruits him. Basically, the organization calculates probabilities of crime and then takes bets on whether Winchester can stop them. Or something like that.

161,"Recently,  Corrine Bauer and Pat Melody, members of my Mindfulness Meditation Group,  held a vigil on behalf of Hispanic immigrants locked up in the Ramsey County Adult Detention Center. Thanks to Corrine and Pat for being mindful of the welfare of others. I'm re-posting the text below from Labor Day 2007 as it continues to be relevant in the context of the status of immigrants in this country and around the globe. Too many Americans oppose immigration as they fear competition for jobs from immigrants seeking safe haven within US borders. The success of an initiative by my employer a few years ago should lay those fears to rest. Nevertheless, we continue to harass Hispanic immigrants in the US, while around the globe, Syrian refugees are too often turned away. Picture this: I’m a young WAF assigned to clerical duties in an office on Scott Air Force Base, near East St. Louis, Ill. On this particular morning I overhear an Air Force major and a colonel, both Caucasian, discuss the qualifications of a civil service employee under consideration for promotion; the colonel apparently likes her resume. Then he asks, “Is she Caucasian?”
“Negative,” the major replies.
Here's the deal: I’m a Caucasian who grew up in lily-white, rural northwestern Ohio, and this was the first time I’d seen up close the ugliness of racial discrimination. Stunned, I sat there at my typewriter, trying to focus on my work.
(In the weeks that follow, I notice the employee in question is not promoted.)
On the upside, my stint in the military provided my first opportunity to make friends with members of other races and ethnic backgrounds.
I’ve not forgotten Hispanic Maria Venegas; African-Americans Katie Harmon, Annie Terry, and Adeline Lincoln; Parisian French Caucasian Monique Horlaville; and New Orleans French Caucasian Priscilla Bertrand.
Years passed before I encountered a comparable diversity in civilian life ― diversity fostered intentionally in the regional office of a large corporation located in a thriving upscale suburb.
Admittedly, the company’s motives were more practical than altruistic. At a department meeting, Tony, our African-American assistant manager, asked if any of us knew what was behind the diversity initiative. He rolled his eyes when I suggested that our company supported diversity because it was the right thing to do.
Tony then explained the business case for diversity: “If we want to sell our products to the Hmong community, African-Americans, Hispanics, Gays, women, or other minority group, we’d best include their members in our workforce.”
Altruistic or not, it’s amazing how quickly people can adapt to an inclusive environment when their livelihoods are at stake and before long, the 2000 plus employees in that huge office building formed a genuine community featuring many of the amenities and rituals of a small town.
Sad to say, our community ― by then a model of diversity ― became a casualty of corporate downsizing when, thanks to technology, our work was moved elsewhere. But for quite a few years each of us had good cause for celebrating Labor Day.
Perhaps the time will come when a majority of Americans will have matured sufficiently to create similar communities, whatever their context, purely because it’s the right thing to do.    Posted by VIRGINIA BERGMAN at 6:44 AM No comments: Links to this post Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest   Labels: African-American, Air Force, civil rights, community, corporate downsizing, diversity, equal opportunity, Gays, Hispanic, Hmong, inclusive, Labor Day, military, minority groups  ",8af97503-8a66-483b-b364-a1f2b207d7a7,Blog,2015-09-07T15:14:18Z,Katalusis,A Labor Day Salute to Diversity,1.0,News

With the release of the 2016 Nissan LEAF still quite a ways off, one might not expect people to be so impatient that they’re taking pictures of suspicious-looking Nissan LEAFs at the company’s headquarters in Franklin, Tennessee… But that person would be wrong. 
 
Thanks to one particularly enthusiastic blogger, we now have a picture of what may very well be the (an early version of the?) 2016 Nissan LEAF. The giveaway in this case is the fact that the LEAF in question features a paint color that is unavailable for extant models but expected to become available for the 2016 model. Hmmm. 
 

 
Electrek provides more information and commentary: 
 
Nissan has been careful not to release too much information about the 2016 update of its flagship electric vehicle, the LEAF, most probably not to hurt the sales of its current model. Though we learned through information leaked from dealerships that Nissan should offer a bigger battery pack option for more range in the 2016 version. The new model is expected to arrive at the end of month like most 2016 cars, but we have yet to get an official launch date or see one in the flesh, until now… 
 
Blogger JP White spotted a Nissan LEAF with a new ‘Forged Bronze’ paint job at Nissan HQ in Franklin TN (see picture above). Forged Bronze is not available for the 2015 model, but is expected to be for the 2016 version. The car also had “manufacturer tags”. Since the 2016 version is not expected to see any significant exterior design changes, this could very well be a 2016 LEAF and the first sighting of one in the US. Hopefully this means we are close to the launch because Nissan’s LEAF sales have been suffering lately ahead of the 2016 launch. 
 
… Or it could simply be a 2015 Nissan LEAF with a paint color that’s currently unavailable to the great unwashed masses. It is the company’s headquarters, after all — perhaps it’s just a matter of someone getting a slight insider favor? It is a nice color, I admit. 
 
We’re hoping it’s a 2016 LEAF. And hopefully we’ll have a lot more info on the 2016 LEAF soon — sales have indeed been suffering . In the meantime, we covered the rumors here:  2016 Nissan LEAF With 110-Mile Option? I’m Stoked!

3274,"Andy Murray tumbled out of the US Open and was one racquet down after losing his temper during the fourth-round defeat to Kevin Anderson. 
 
The Scot let out a string of expletives during the break between the second and third sets, seemingly frustrated by the time Anderson was taking in a break off the court. 
 
Then after dropping serve in the third set, he smashed a racquet on the court, breaking it beyond repair and handing it to a spectator as an unexpected souvenir. 
 
Speaking about the tension in the match, Murray later said:  ""In the second set I felt like I was starting to put pressure on him there. When I had the break point at 5-3, I had a backhand pass that I really should have made. When you're playing against players that are at that level, like him, you need to obviously make them think and then give them a chance to get nervous. 
 
""The beginning of the fourth set, as well, I think it was his first service game, I had 15-all, hit a drop shot, mid-court forehand, then ended up winning the next couple of points. 
 
""I felt like I had my opportunities there but didn't manage to capitalise on them. When you're playing against someone as good as him, you know, it's tough."" 
 
Big-serving South African Anderson played the match of his  life to win 7-6 (7/5) 6-3 6-7 (2/7) 7-6 (7/0). 
 
Anderson has been helped by a sports psychologist and believes he has been able to keep his composure and focus in high-pressure matches because of that off-court guidance.

He said: ""I think especially at this level, there's such fine details. I think a lot of the physical side, obviously I'm working on that. But I felt just from the mental side, being as neutral as possible in these big match-ups, somebody just to talk through, you know, sort of understands how I think and stuff has definitely been a huge benefit for me. 
 
""I definitely feel even though it's a gradual process, I feel like I'm on the right path and making good decisions.""",6a9510a1-cc94-46f3-a1f4-05f1f0656bdf,News,2015-09-08T10:34:30Z,Epsom Guardian,Andy Murray loses his cool and smashes racquet in US Open defeat,0.0,News

1811,"A mixed jobs report has clouded prospects for the Federal Reserve raising interest rates later this month, experts said, as that uncertainty sent the stock markets into a dive again. 

“If the Fed thought their decision was complicated before, this morning’s employment report will now make it that much more challenging for the Fed to reach a unanimous decision in September,” said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist for Stifel Fixed Income. 

U.S. employers added 173,000 jobs in August — the fewest in five months, but the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent, the lowest in seven years. 

The Labor Department report wasn’t the unambiguous signal many on Wall Street were hoping for and the prospect of higher interest rates weighed heavily on the markets. The Dow fell 272 points, or 1.7 percent yesterday, while the S&P fell 1.5 percent. 

The jobs report is the last major data about the economy before the Fed’s meeting later this month. 

Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said in a speech before the jobs report was released yesterday that it is time to raise rates. 

“It’s time to align our monetary policy with the significant progress we have made” in the economy, Lacker said. 

Still, other Fed officials appear to be more cautious because of concerns over international growth and slow inflation. 

“If the decision was made on labor markets alone, this would encourage the Fed to raise interest rates,” said Sara Johnson, senior research director of IHS Global Insight. 

“Our view is they will take into account a number of other factors, including international problems and inflation.”",ba4818d5-5a40-4912-9709-727b291f00fc,News,2015-09-05T05:43:00Z,The Suit Magazine,"Jobs report complicates Fed rate hike, causing stocks to dive - Boston Herald",0.0,News
2188,"SAN DIEGO, Sept. 18, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TRACON Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: TCON), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel targeted therapeutics for cancer, wet age-related macular degeneration and fibrotic diseases, today announced results from two oral presentations, one by Dr. Kevin Elias and one by Dr. Neil Horowitz, both of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, at the 18th World Congress on Gestational Trophoblastic Diseases in Densapar, Bali, Indonesia. The single patient compassionate use Phase 2 clinical trial enrolled a 37-year old woman with persistent and unresectable metastatic choriocarcinoma, an aggressive form of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). Prior to entry into the trial, the patient had received multiple treatments, including laparoscopic hysterectomy, five prior chemotherapy regimens and stem cell transplant.

The patient was treated with TRC105 dosed 10 mg/kg weekly in combination with Avastin® (bevacizumab) dosed 10 mg/kg every other week. As of the time of the presentation, the patient had completed 7 cycles (28 weeks) of treatment. Beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG), a known, reliable marker of disease burden in choriocarcinoma, normalized during the fourth cycle of treatment, decreasing from greater than 3,000 IU/L at treatment initiation to less than 1 IU/L from cycles 4 through 7, indicating an ongoing complete response. 

Choriocarcinoma represents the second tumor type known to express high levels of endoglin in which complete durable responses have been observed following treatment with a combination of TRC105 and a VEGF inhibitor. In June 2015, Dr. Steven Attia of the Mayo Clinic reported complete responses in two patients with angiosarcoma, treated with TRC105 and Votrient® (pazopanib), at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting in Chicago.

""We have now seen complete responses in two orphan tumor types that overexpress endoglin, choriocarcinoma and angiosarcoma. There are currently limited treatment options for patients with either of these cancers who progress on first-line chemotherapy,"" said Charles P. Theuer, M.D., Ph.D., President and CEO of TRACON. ""We intend to treat additional patients with GTN in a Phase 2 multicenter trial that we expect to initiate in the fourth quarter of 2015, and to apply for orphan drug status for TRC105 in GTN, as well as soft tissue sarcoma, by the end of the year.""

About Choriocarcinoma1

Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) is the term used to describe a group of rare diseases that originate in the placenta and have the potential to locally invade the uterus and metastasize. The pathogenesis of GTD is unique because the maternal tumor arises from gestational rather than maternal tissue. The major histologic entities for this disease include complete molar pregnancy, partial molar pregnancy, invasive mole, and choriocarcinoma. The term gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) is used when molar and non-molar pregnancies become malignant, and comprise the morphologic entities of invasive mole and choriocarcinoma. Choriocarcinoma metastasizes hematogenously and can follow any type of pregnancy, but most commonly develops after complete hydatidiform mole. The reported incidence of GTD in the United States is about 110 to 120 per 100,000 pregnancies. The reported incidence of choriocarcinoma, the most aggressive form of GTD, in the United States is about 2 to 7 per 100,000 pregnancies. 1Source: National Cancer Institute

2293,"Last week, Christine had her 20 week ultrasound scan. Our baby is developing normally, it would seem – everything seems present and correct, and he or she is growing at the correct rate. And the image is much more clear than it was at the first scan at approximately 11 weeks. 

We did find out the gender of the baby and have told some people (mainly family), but we’re not making it widely known. This is mainly because the sonographer wasn’t very confident about whether the baby is a boy or a girl, but also because we don’t want to end up with lots of pink or blue clothes in case we have another child later on. 

Christine is still due to give birth in early January.

1182,"In the interest of full disclosure, One Mile At A Time earns a referral bonus for purchases made through some of the below links. These are products and services we use ourselves, and are the best offers we know of. Thanks for your support! Through October 5, 2015, Hilton HHonors is offering up to a 75% bonus on purchased points. This comes roughly a week after Hilton concluded their previous bonus on purchased points. Through this promotion, the bonuses are tiered, meaning the more points you purchase, the greater the bonus you receive: Buy 10,000-29,000 points, receive a 25% bonus Buy 30,000-39,000 points, receive a 50% bonus Buy 40,000+ points, receive a 75% bonus The cost to purchase points with HHonors is ordinarily one cent per point (including tax), so assuming you purchase at least 40,000 points you’d be looking at a cost of ~0.57 cents per Hilton point. You can purchase a maximum of 80,000 HHonors points before any bonuses per account per calendar year, meaning the highest number of points you can pick up through this promotion is 140,000 at a cost of $800. I value Hilton HHonors points at ~0.4 cents each, though there are certainly instances where you can get more value out of Hilton points than that. To put that price into context, here are Hilton’s award categories (as you can see there’s quite a bit of variance in each category — HHonors is the closest to being a revenue based hotel program): A Category 1 property is 5,000 points per night, and Hilton offers elite members a fifth night free, bringing down the average cost to 4,000 points per night. At ~0.57 cents per point, that’s like paying ~$23 per night: Meanwhile Category 2 properties go for 10,000 points per night, so with a fifth night free that’s an average cost of 8,000 points per night. At ~0.57 cents per point, that’s like paying ~$46 per night: As you can see, in all cases these represent huge savings over the paid rates. In many cases the numbers work out quite favorably as well for higher end hotels. Here are the full terms of the promotion: Points purchased do not count towards elite tier qualification. Points.com and Hilton HHonors reserve the right to terminate bonus promotions at any time. All purchases must be made through the Purchase page on HHonors.com. The up to 75% bonus is available for purchases made between September 9, 2015, at 12:01am ET and October 5, 2015, at 11:59pm ET. All purchases are non-refundable. Offer is subject to change. Offer cannot be combined with any other offer. Points will be posted to the recipients Hilton HHonors account within 24 hours of the completed transaction. Buy transactions are final and non-refundable. All Hilton HHonors program terms and conditions apply. Hilton HHonorsTM membership, earning of Points and MilesTM and redemption of Points are subject to HHonors Terms and Conditions. * Email address is required and will only be used for transaction and marketing communications related to this purchase.Price includes all applicable fees. GST/HST will be charged to Canadian residents. Members may receive a maximum of 80,000 purchased points per calendar year. Purchased points are not refundable and are applicable towards all HHonors awards. Points purchased using this option will post within 24 hours. Email address is required and will only be used for transaction and marketing communications related to this purchase. Purchased points do not count towards HHonors status upgrades. All standard HHonors program rules and conditions apply. As you can see, purchased points should post within 24 hours, and purchases are processed by points.com, meaning they don’t qualify as hotel spend for the purposes of your credit card. Therefore you’ll want to use a credit card which maximizes your return on everyday spend for the purchase. Bottom line  In general I’m not for speculatively buying points when they’re being sold for more than I value them. That being said, that’s the beauty of non-revenue based points currencies — the way in which people value them varies wildly. I know people that value Hilton points at 0.3 cents each, and I know people that value them at 1.0 cent each. Ultimately a 75% bonus isn’t the best we’ve seen. Like I said, we saw an 80% bonus recently, and before that we saw a 100% bonus. That being said, if you have a short term use of the points in mind and the math works out, it can definitely make sense to take advantage of this promotion. I also think it’s interesting to note how HHonors seems to be a more aggressive program lately. They’ve been selling points much more frequently than in the past, and have also greatly improved their promotions. Do you plan on buying Hilton HHonors points for ~0.57 cents each?

5093,"  
 The rapidly changing retail market could favour independent health retailers and eco brands, a leading retail analyst has suggested.  
Martin Watkins, head of retail and business insights at analysts Nielsen, said there was “no going back” to the retail model that dominated the pre-internet era. 
 
Speaking at a recent Soil Association Trade briefing, Watkins said that the new landscape was characterized by features such as ‘Channel shifts’, ‘retailer disruption’, ‘small store shopping’, ‘digital and disloyal’, ‘low growth in FMCG’ and ‘spending less, saving less’. 
 
The single biggest change in retail, he said, was “the shift of spend away from large store formats”. That change in behaviour is boosting footfall on local high streets to the potential benefit of independents. 
 
Meanwhle, with an improving economic outlook, health has been rising up the consumer agenda. 60% of shoppers polled by Neilsen said they were “actively looking for healthier options” when food shopping, with 33% saying their main focus is “longevity and maintaining good health” (tellingly, in 2015 “reducing sugar intake” has replaced “getting my five-a-day” as consumers’ number one health priority). 
 
“34% would be willing to switch to a more environmentally friendly brand, and 23% to more a environmentally friendly retailer” 
 
Eco and organic brands are also likely to benefit from shoppers’ “wider ethical expectations”, says Nielsen. 67% of shoppers said they like to support local businesses and farmers, while 34% would be willing to switch to a more environmentally friendly brand, and 23% to more a environmentally friendly retailer.",d5f22844-432d-493d-98f7-6f2515f05797,Blog,2015-09-24T06:33:57Z,www.naturalproductsonline.co.uk,New retail landscape could favour health stores and eco brands,1.0,Blog

2807,"If you plan to buy a home with financing, you may feel overwhelmed by everything you need to learn about the process . Here are five key points to get you started. 
 Understand the full cost of owning a home  
There are four main categories of a homeowner’s monthly housing payment - principal, interest, taxes and insurance (P.I.T.I.) . 
 
Principal and interest comprise your monthly mortgage payment. The principal pays down your loan balance monthly, and the interest pays your fee for borrowing the money. Use an amortization calculator  to see the principal-versus-interest breakdown over time. 
 
Taxes refer to property taxes assessed by the county you live in, and average 1.2 percent of your home’s value each year. 
 
Homeowners insurance is required when you have a mortgage, and you pay it to an insurance company of your choosing. Insurance typically costs $700 to $1,200 per year for a single family home. 
 
In addition to P.I.T.I., if you live in a planned unit development (PUD) or condo, you'll have homeowners association dues, which cover common area amenities, ongoing upkeep, and reserves for future maintenance. These monthly dues range from $100 to over $1,000. 
 
If you don’t live in a PUD or condo, you should construct your own savings plan for future maintenance. 
 Examine your credit history now  
A strong credit report is critical for getting the best mortgages with the lowest rates. Lenders want reliable on-time payment history, as well as credit depth. 
 
Your report will be more appealing to lenders if you have a significant amount of credit. If you need to obtain more credit, note that your credit score can drop 5-15 points when you first open a new account, then will rise again when you’ve established good payment history, so it’s best to open new accounts a few months before applying for a mortgage. 
 
Federal law entitles you to a free credit report every year , but these reports only show account history, and don’t include scores. 
 
Get your credit score , and take steps to improve it , if necessary. 
 Match mortgage products to your budget and timeline  
You can calculate how much you can afford to spend on a home  with inputs you already know: income, monthly non-housing debt, and savings for down payment. 
 
Next, you need to think about how long you’re going to be in a particular home so you can target the right loan product . 
 
If your income isn’t going to grow over time, you will probably be in the home longer term, so you’ll want a loan with a payment that won’t change, like a 30-year fixed . 
 
Or maybe you expect your income to increase sharply within five years and you’re going to upgrade homes within that time, so you’ll want a five-year ARM , which has a much lower rate. 
 
If you don’t have a 20-percent down payment , you can buy with as little as 3 percent down using FHA , VA , Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac low-down programs , but you’ll have mortgage insurance on top of your monthly P.I.T.I. 
 
Estimate your mortgage insurance with a mortgage calculator . 
 Get pre-approved in advance  
If you do all your home financing research without getting pre-approved , you could be disappointed when it comes time to find a home. 
 
Home shopping is competitive, and most sellers require your offer to be submitted with a lender pre-approval letter to prove you’re all ready with your financing. 
 Know what lenders will require  
When you’re ready to get pre-approved, remember that lenders will closely examine all aspects of your life. 
 
They’ll ask for full name, address, date of birth, social security number, and ages of children. They’ll also review your credit report, employment history, pay stubs, tax returns, bank statements, divorce and any other legal settlements, and full financials for any businesses you own. 
 
A lender will give you a checklist outlining exactly what documents they need. Follow this checklist exactly. If they only ask for your last two pay stubs, don’t send three. If they only ask for federal tax returns, don’t send state. 
 
Also, be prepared to write short letters to explain past inquiries on your credit report, past addresses, and name changes. 
 
Now that you've got an overview, you can dive deeper into home financing topics , then find a lender in your area  to partner with you through the process.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimate of 3.1 million deaths occurred due to COPD in 2012, which accounted for about 5.6% of the global death toll. In 2012, nearly 6.7 million deaths occurred due to CVD stroke which accounted for about 11.9% of the global death toll. The frequent launch of smartphone based medical devices such as cardiac monitors, respiratory monitors and blood glucose monitors address the need for regular health monitoring and treatment of diseases.

1467,"The latest on the 2016 presidential campaign from Iowa, Michigan, New York, New Hampshire and Georgia (all times local). 

6 p.m. 

Rick Santorum is asking Iowa Republicans to pledge their support once again for his presidential bid, casting himself as an outsider candidate with the ""skills of an insider"" to get things done in Washington. 

The former Pennsylvania senator spoke at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition presidential forum, reminding audience members how they gave him a victory in the 2012 Iowa caucuses when he was at just 2 percent in the national polls. 

Santorum says that while in Congress he fought the tough issues on behalf of conservatives involving ""life, marriage, faith and religious freedom"" and won't hesitate to ""shake things up"" if elected to put ""this country back on the right track."" 

5:15 p.m. 

South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham says people are responding to his message about more drinking in the White House. 

The 2016 Republican presidential candidate has been mingling at an Iowa event for evangelical voters. He says that he's gotten positive feedback for his crack during the Wednesday undercard debate that if he becomes president, ""we're going to drink more."" 

Graham was noting that President Ronald Reagan and House Speaker Tip O'Neill would share a drink in spite of their differences. 

Graham says that he's benefiting from showing a sense of humor on stage. 

He points out that Regan had a good sense of humor and that ""sometimes you can make your points better with humor that you can anything else."" 

Asked about what he thinks of being seen as the funny candidate in the race, Graham quips, ""The bar is low."" 

4:40 p.m. 

Jeb Bush hopes to do well in the Republican primaries in both Georgia and South Carolina, so he's not about to offend football fans in either state. 

Bush spoke briefly and posed for hundreds of selfies on the University of Georgia campus before the Bulldogs hosted a Southeastern Conference game against the University of South Carolina. 

Asked who he was rooting for in the game, the former Florida governor declares that he's ""kind of neutral on the subject."" 

The politically correct answer. 

But Bush predicted Georgia would win the SEC East and Louisiana State University would take the SEC's Western Division. 

Bush says he's even ""got money on it. Five bucks I think."" 

— Paul Newberry reporting from Athens, Georgia 

2:10 p.m. 

Ohio Gov. John Kasich says Latino workers are ""completely involved"" in all aspects of the U.S economy and not limited to certain segments. 

The presidential contender has come under criticism from Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton for generalizing about Latinos after telling a story about a note left for him by a hotel maid that said she valued his stay. He told reporters Saturday at a Republican leadership conference on Mackinac (MAK'-ih-naw) Island, Michigan, he was just trying to ""slow down and honor people who sometimes we run past very quickly."" 

Kasich says he's a strong advocate ""for how Hispanics in this country can add so much in every profession."" 

During remarks Thursday in California, Kasich talked about a Latina hotel maid and said ""a lot of them do jobs that they're willing to do, and that's why in the hotel you leave a little tip."" The president of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce says he didn't find the comments offensive. 

2:01 p.m. 

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is energizing New Hampshire Democrats by calling for a ""political revolution"" and slamming the GOP field on climate change, gay marriage and foreign policy. 

Sanders is calling for an end to corporate greed and a need to take on the ""billionaire class,"" saying ""No president can do it alone unless we have a political revolution."" 

He says Democrats lost the 2014 midterm elections because they failed to turn out voters. 

Sanders continues to surge in the early voting state, where he now leads Hillary Rodham Clinton in some polls. His speech during the state Democratic Party's annual convention in Manchester is drawing chants and raucous applause. Many of Clinton's supporters who dotted the stands earlier in the day left before Sanders took the stage. 

12:02 p.m. 

Hillary Rodham Clinton is taking aim at the Republican presidential field, saying the GOP debate this week featured not ""a single fighter for the middle class."" 

Clinton has called viewers of the three-hour event ""gluttons for punishment"" and says Republicans are focusing on problems the country faces rather than solutions. 

Clinton says voters who want a leader to tell them ""everything that's wrong with America"" have ""plenty of other choices."" 

She saved her toughest critique for front-runner Donald Trump. Clinton says Trump is ""trafficking in prejudice and paranoia"" and doesn't respect women. Those views, she says, are shared by the rest of the 15 person field. 

Clinton is addressing a convention of New Hampshire Democrats at the end of a three-day swing through the early primary state. 

10:20 a.m. 

New Hampshire Democrats have a message for the Democratic National Committee: Bring on more debates. 

Activists chanting ""We want more debates!"" drowned out DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz's speech several times at the New Hampshire Democratic Party's convention in Manchester on Saturday morning. Wasserman-Schultz became noticeably frustrated on several occasions. She asked ""What's more important? Drawing a contrast with Republicans or arguing about debates?"" 

In response, the chants continued. Finally, she said, ""Enough is enough."" 

The DNC has sanctioned six debates, but supporters of Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders are demanding more. They say the limited number of events is an effort to coronate a nominee. Front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign has said she's open to more debates, but has not called for more. 

9:28 a.m. 

Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker is skipping a prestigious Michigan Republican conference this weekend, as he downshifts his campaign to focus on Iowa. 

Wisconsin's governor was to address more than 1,000 people during breakfast Saturday morning at the Mackinac (MAK'-ih-naw) Republican Leadership Conference on the picturesque island in northern Michigan. 

But Walker's campaign called at 5:45 a.m. Saturday to say he would be unable to attend. 

His campaign spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, said in an email that inclement weather in Chicago grounded Walker's flight. 

The Wisconsin governor was originally scheduled to kick off the event with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush Friday evening. But he cancelled last week, saying he couldn't get from a Republican forum in South Carolina late Friday. 

Bush attended the same South Carolina forum and headlined the Mackinac Island dinner solo. 

Michigan holds its primary in March. Republicans view the state as in play for the general election. 

7:45 a.m. 

Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump is defending his decision not to correct a questioner at a recent town hall event who erroneously stated that President Barack Obama is Muslim. 

Obama is Christian. 

In a series of tweets from New York City Saturday morning, Trump said he didn't think he was ""morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him."" 

The billionaire businessman then tweeted ""No chance!"" that the president would ""come to my rescue"" if someone made a nasty statement about Trump. 

The billionaire businessman had been silent on the Thursday night exchange other than a statement from his campaign that raised concerns about the treatment of Christians in the U.S. 

He tweeted Saturday that for the first time in his life he has ""caused controversy by NOT saying something.""",3629a628-61f7-4a45-9beb-2f16e72d14e0,News,2015-09-19T23:38:14Z,Wichita Eagle,The Latest on the 2016 campaign: Rick Santorum's Iowa pitch,0.0,Blog

3129,"Congress has until Sept. 30 to pass a spending bill 

By 

Updated 09/17 2015 09:24PM

President Barack Obama met with top Democratic leaders behind closed doors at the White House Thursday as Congress scrambles to avoid a government shutdown. 

Speaking to reporters outside the West Wing following the hour-and-a-half-long huddle that focused on budget negotiations, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid announced that he, Obama and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi were in agreement on a short-term continuing resolution to keep the government running and allow time for negotiations on a ""meaningful"" budget. 

Democrats want to keep pressure on Republicans to negotiate a broader budget deal that would remove the across-the-board forced spending cuts, known as ""sequestration,"" that are in place now. The sooner they reach a deal, the sooner domestic programs would potentially be less impacted by these budget cuts. 

Pelosi said she felt prepared heading into budget talks focused on a deal that lifted sequestration caps in a way that domestic spending was increased at the same rate as defense spending -- ""dollar for dollar,"" as she put it. 

Reid praised Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for acknowledging that something needed to be done on caps as well as discussing a clean continuing resolution, one that addresses funding the government without adding on other provisions, such as defunding Planned Parenthood. 

Congress has until September 30 to pass a spending bill and avert a government shutdown. Many House Republicans say they will not vote for a bill that provides any funding for the controversial women's health organization. 

House Republican leaders are expected to soon move forward with a short-term funding bill. Separately, they would aim to pass a measure to defund Planned Parenthood through a process known as ""budget reconciliation"" that would bypass a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. 

But Pelosi said she was optimistic about the chances of avoiding a shutdown. 

""I'm hopeful that we're all in agreement ... that we should not have a government shutdown,"" she said. ""It's costly to the government and to the American people. So we are optimistic, we want to be cooperative, we want to negotiate in good faith."" 

The White House later released a statement, saying Hill Democrats ""would support a clean, short-term continuing resolution to provide more time to negotiate an agreement that invests in middle-class economic priorities and helps our entire economy grow."" 

Later Thursday, Pelosi met with House Speaker John Boehner for roughly 20 minutes in the speaker's office to discuss next steps on funding the government. 

""We're having a conversation about getting close to how we negotiate,"" Pelosi told reporters. 

She didn't know when they would sit down again to get into specific details, and said they had not arrived on an overall budget level yet. 

Pelosi said she didn't like a GOP proposal to pass a stopgap bill to fund the government through mid-December 

""I'd rather have it be a shorter term (continuing resolution),"" she said. ""Why should we put it off?""",e9eac59e-dcdf-458b-8f45-3edc3ed0386c,News,2015-09-18T03:01:42Z,Everything Lubbock,"Pelosi, Reid scramble to avoid gov't shutdown",0.0,Blog

451,"Floyd Mayweather Jr. plans to go out unbeaten and on his own terms, as 'The Best Ever', when he ends his boxing career in Las Vegas next week with his welterweight title defence against fellow American Andre Berto. 

Should Mayweather win, as is widely expected, he would match the 49-0 record of former heavyweight great Rocky Marciano but says he would not be tempted to come out of retirement for a 50th fight. 

Image Credit: . 
 
""Forty-nine is my last fight,"" the five-division world champion, aged 38, told reporters on a conference call on Wednesday before saying that self-preservation in the ring had always been a top priority. 

""My health is more important. Anything can happen (in boxing). I am not really worried about losing. You can make a lot of money but you still won't be able to talk, walk and have a sharp mind. 

""Of course, it's always about self-preservation. I come first but I appreciate the fans. I do. The only thing I can do is believe in myself. I'm going to be TBE (The Best Ever) until the day I die."" 

Many pundits have doubted Mayweather's claim that he will end his career after the Sept. 12 bout, pointing to the American's U-turn when he came back from a 21-month retirement to fight Mexican Juan Manuel Marquez in September 2009. 

""Like I have said and Floyd has said a number of times, this will be his last fight,"" Leonard Ellerbe, CEO of Mayweather Promotions, said on Wednesday's conference call. 

""Why can't a man go out when he has had an illustrious career, accomplished everything that he needed to accomplish and be done? And he has done it his way. 

""Over the last week, I have received three major movie offers. We fully expect Floyd to be heavily, heavily involved in the entertainment industry because this is what he does right now ... that is going to occupy a lot of his time."" 

Mayweather, whose 48-0 record includes 26 knockouts, is renowned for his brilliant defence in the ring though he has often been criticized for selecting easy opponents while building his impressive resume. 

Asked what he regarded as the greatest achievement of his career, he replied: ""Every fight played a major key ... and number 49 is going to be important also. But my career's not over yet."" 

Berto, a twice former welterweight world champion, will step into the ring as a heavy underdog after losing three of his last six fights but Mayweather is wary of underestimating his opponent. 

""When you've got a guy that's put in a situation with nothing to lose, it makes him work that much harder,"" said Mayweather. ""He has a chance to be one of the top guys in the sport when I am through. You never overlook anyone.""

2955,"NEW YORK - A former hedge fund manager turned pharmacist, Martin Shkreli, who jacked up the price of the drug Daraprim a staggering 5,000 percent overnight, has said he will consider lowering the cost of the life-saving medicine after a huge public outrage. 

Shkreli, 32, who heads the pharmaceutical company Turing, did not say what the new price would be. But he said it will be decided over the next few weeks.

""We've agreed to lower the price of Daraprim to a price that is more affordable,"" Shkreli said on ABC World News Tonight.

He told NBC News Tuesday that the decision to lower the price was a reaction to outrage over the increase in the price of the drug from $13.50 to $750 per pill.

""Yes it is absolutely a reaction there were mistakes made with respect to helping people understand why we took this action, I think that it makes sense to lower the price in response to the anger that was felt by people,"" said Shkreli, who had became the focus of public anger.

The 5,000 percent increase in the drug price also caught the eye of Hillary Clinton who tweeted about it Monday, saying she wanted to put an end to drug ""price gouging"".

Daraprim fights toxoplasmosis, which infects people whose immune systems have been weakened by AIDS, chemotherapy and pregnancy, according to the Center of Disease Control.

It's been around for decades but Shkreli's company bought the rights to it in August for $55 million. The main use of the drug is to treat life-threatening parasitic infections.

Shkreli, who has been called a boy genius, had become the face of the outcry and outrage spread across the virtual world.

The Daily Beast declared him the ""most-hated man in America,"" surpassing the dentist who killed Cecil the Lion.

Shkreli has said that the drug is so rarely used that the impact on the health system would be minuscule.

He said he wanted the money from the price increase to be used to develop better treatment for toxoplasmosis that have fewer side effects.

""It's very easy to see a large drug price increase and say 'Gosh those people must be gouging,' but when you find out the company is not making any money, what does that mean?"" Shkreli said in a phone interview with NBC News Tuesday. ""It's very hard stuff to understand.""",51204204-2a2c-43f7-b481-21b94f6f437e,News,2015-09-23T07:05:20Z,Philippines News.net,Hike in price of life-saving Daraprim may be trimmed,0.0,News
3687,"14-year-old's clock mistaken for bomb 

Updated 09/17 2015 04:51AM 

Copyright 2015 Cable News Network/Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. 

(CNN) 

The week started pretty terribly for Texas high school student Ahmed Mohamed. On Monday, the teen, who is Muslim, brought to school a clock that he was proud to have made on his own and was arrested for what police initially -- and falsely -- said was a hoax bomb. 

But by mid-week, his face and name were splashed across traditional and social media, and he'd received thousands of tweets and Facebook posts of encouragement. President Barack Obama invited him to the White House and praised his love of science. Leaders at Reddit and Twitter offered him internships. Google executives said they were reserving Ahmed a spot at their weekend science fair and MIT asked him to visit the campus. 

Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg invited him to visit the company's headquarters, posting, ""Having the skill and ambition to build something cool should lead to applause, not arrest. The future belongs to people like Ahmed."" 

The hashtags #IStandWithAhmed and #EngineersForAhmed garnered hundreds of thousands of posts and tweets. 

By Thursday, more details of the 14-year-old's arrest in Irving, Texas, came to light. 

In an interview late Wednesday with MSNBC's Chris Hayes, Ahmed said he was pulled out of class at MacArthur High School by his principal and five police officers and taken to a room where he was questioned for about an hour and a half. 

He said he asked the adults if he could call his parents. 

""They told me 'No, you can't call your parents,'"" Ahmed said. ""'You're in the middle of an interrogation at the moment.' They asked me a couple of times, 'Is it a bomb?' and I answered a couple of times, 'It's a clock.'"" 

""I felt like I was a criminal,"" the teenager said. ""I felt like I was a terrorist. I felt like all the names I was called."" 

Hayes asked what he meant. 

In middle school, Ahmed said, he had been called ""bombmaker"" and a ""terrorist."" 

""Just because of my race and my religion,"" he said, adding that when he walked into the room where he was questioned, an officer reclined in a chair and remarked, ""That's who I thought it was."" 

""I took it to mean he was pointing at me for what I am, my race,"" the freshman explained. 

Ahmed is not going back to MacArthur -- he's transferring to another school, said family spokesperson Omair Siddiqi of the Dallas-Forth Worth chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a non-profit advocacy organization that has been helping the family handle media calls. 

'Scared but happy now' 

Ahmed's father, Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed, who immigrated to the United States from Sudan, believes that his son was targeted because of his brown skin color and his religion. 

The teen has never been in trouble, Mohamed told CNN. ""My son's name is Mohamed -- people just think Muslims are terrorists but we are peaceful, we are not that way,"" he said. 

He was furious that the school didn't contact him right away to tell him his son had been arrested. Instead, he first learned of what happened when police called him. 

Mohamed said he rushed to the station and saw his son ""surrounded by five police and he was handcuffed."" 

The school later suspended Ahmed for three days, his father said. 

Mohamed said his son was at first embarrassed by what happened, but then was lifted and emboldened by the widespread support he has received. 

Ahmed also appeared on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Thursday. 

""I was scared at the moment, but now I feel really happy,"" he said. ""I'm getting all this support from all over the world. And the support isn't just for me but for everyone who has been through this. I will fight for you if you can't stand up for yourself."" 

He said he was most excited to hear from MIT. ""I dream of going there,"" he said. 

And he's thrilled to go to the White House. 

""I hope to see him soon,"" Ahmed said of Obama. 

Whether the clock goes with him depends on Irving police. Late Wednesday, they were still holding the device as evidence. 

Asked what his plans for the future are, he told GMA, ""That clock was part of my future."" 

Mayor defend police, school 

Irving Mayor Beth Van Duyne defended the school district and police. 

""I do not fault the school or the police for looking into what they saw as a potential threat,"" she said in a statement. They all followed procedures, she said. 

Van Duyne has had controversial interactions with Irving's Muslim community, most notably when she supported a resolution that would prohibit ""foreign law,"" including Islamic or sharia law, CNN affiliate KTVT reported. 

A spokeswoman for the Irving Independent School District said that the way the teen's experience has been described in media reports is ""unbalanced."" 

She declined to explain why, citing the need to protect a student's privacy, but said more details would be revealed if the family gives written permission to discuss the incident.",76d49aa9-1ffd-47a3-8c40-d81c9321eb82,News,2015-09-17T20:39:24Z,WTVW FOX 7,Clock-making teen transferring to another school,0.0,Blog
506,"OLDWICK, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 

A.M. Best has affirmed the financial strength rating (FSR) of B+ (Good) and the issuer credit ratings (ICR) of ""bbb-"" of MVP Health Plan, Inc. and its affiliate, MVP Health Service Corp. Additionally, A.M. Best has upgraded the FSR to B+ (Good) from B (Fair) and the ICR of ""bbb-"" from ""bb"" of MVP Health Insurance Company. Concurrently, A.M. Best has withdrawn the FSR of B (Fair) and the ICR of ""bb"" of MVP Health Insurance Company of New Hampshire, Inc. (Bedford, NH). The outlook for all ratings remains stable, except for the outlook on MVP Health Services Corp’s ratings, which was revised to stable from negative. Collectively, all companies are subsidiaries of their direct parent, MVP Health Care, Inc., and are domiciled in Schenectady, NY, unless otherwise specified. 

The upgrading of the ratings of MVP Health Insurance Company reflects its revised strategic role within the group, with greater emphasis on commercial large group business in Vermont. Moreover, significant improvement in operating results has been recorded through mid-2015 and is projected to continue into 2016. 

The outlook revision to stable for MVP Health Service Corp reflects its change in strategic direction, resulting in favorable growth in premium and recent improvement in operating results that is projected to continue into 2016. A.M. Best will continue its discussions with the management team about its revised strategy for this entity, while assessing the capitalization, premium leverage and future direction within the group. A.M. Best anticipates that the parent organization will continue to implicitly and explicitly support the entity to fund its future growth initiatives. 

The rating affirmations of MVP Health Plan, Inc. and its affiliate reflect the companies’ strong brand recognition in New York and well-established network with geographic outreach activities throughout the state, which enhances each entity’s stand-alone assessment as well as the group’s ongoing consolidation of operations and overall sound capitalization. The group gained a larger increase in individual membership due to some carriers not originally being as active in the exchange marketplace. A.M. Best notes that while the group has reported consistent net income over the past three years, it has recorded underwriting losses over the past two years. Management has implemented strategic initiatives to return the group to profitable trends, and through mid-2015, the consolidated operating results have been very favorable. Due to these initiatives, A.M. Best expects the organization to return to its historical level of profitability and maintain a steady growth across its various business lines. The sound but declining level of risk-adjusted capital levels is primarily the result of previous cumulative retained earnings. 

A.M. Best believes that the organization has been pressured by the competitive nature of the commercial market, which is driving significant margin compression on existing and new business. Additionally, the continued shift toward government-sponsored lines of business has been challenging. Moreover, the organization faces continued challenges in the operating performance of its Medicare Advantage business line, which is government-funded and heavily impacted by reimbursement cuts. 

Of note is the considerable contribution of the Medicaid product line to the organization’s consolidated operating performance, driven by strong results produced through its acquisition of the Hudson Health Plan (HHP). In August 2013, MVP Health Plan, Inc. acquired HHP, a Tarrytown, NY-based Medicaid managed care organization. As this entity continues to be integrated into MVP Health Plan, Inc., A.M. Best will continue to assess the ultimate impact of the HHP acquisition on the organization and its overall operations, strategic plans, earnings and capitalization. 

The withdrawal of the ratings on MVP Health Insurance Company of New Hampshire, Inc. reflects management’s decision to exit the New Hampshire market and place its relatively small remaining policies into run-off. The run-off and completion of the withdrawal from New Hampshire is expected to be completed by early 2016. 

A.M. Best believes that positive rating movement is unlikely in the near to medium term. Key rating drivers that could lead to a negative rating action include further deterioration in operating performance in any of its core lines of business, a substantial decline in the consolidated risk-adjusted capitalization or any reimbursement issues surrounding its government-sponsored products. 

This press release relates to rating(s) that have been published on A.M. Best's website. For all rating information relating to the release and pertinent disclosures, including details of the office responsible for issuing each of the individual ratings referenced in this release, please visit A.M. Best’s Ratings & Criteria Center.

Snuggling up next to your kids to read them a bedtime story isn't just helping you bond with your little one.  

We've known for a while that reading to children is a great way to help kids learn how to read for themselves.   
 
But recent research also suggests that storytime has other benefits as well. Here are four of the main reasons why reading to children — especially when you do it regularly — could be crucial: 
 1. It stimulates parts of the brain associated with visual processing.   
A recent  study  highlighted by the  New York Times  found increased activity in the areas of children's brain associated with processing images, suggesting that even when kids aren't reading themselves, they are picturing the places they're hearing about. 
 
“When kids are hearing stories, they’re imagining in their mind’s eye,”  John S. Hutton, a clinical research fellow at  the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center and the lead author of the paper, told the Times . 
 2. It's different than just talking to them.   
Another  study  suggests that reading aloud to children starting when they're infants exposes them to more words than they might pick up from conversation alone. The study also suggested that reading aloud provides them with a better picture of a variety of sentence structures and vocabulary. 
  3. It may boost their ability to process information.    
A recent study  based on data from 4-and-5-year-old Australian children found that — even when they controlled for factors like their parents’ income and education levels — kids whose parents said they read to them at least 6 days a week scored higher on national tests designed to measure understanding and comprehension than those whose parents said they read to them just once or twice a week or less. The differing results appeared to hold steady roughly until the kids reached age 10. 
 4. It may help them problem solve.   
In a survey  of 9-month-olds in Ireland, researchers found that children whose mothers said they read and talked to them ""often"" or ""always"" up until that age performed better on a private questionnaire used by the University of California San Francisco and the University of Oregon   than those whose moms said they read to them ""rarely,"" ""never,"" or ""not at all,"" even when controlling for mother's income and education levels.

The major function of agrochemicals is to address the problem that hinders the growth of crops. It is a widely used term that includes fertilizers and pesticides. Agrochemicals help to increase the productivity of the crops by supplying needed nutrients and providing protection from various diseases, without harming the environment. Thus, the focus of industry players is not only to develop and launch agrochemicals, but also to train its end-users about the proper use of these chemicals. The tightening environmental regulations in developed regions such as North America and Europe are making it difficult for the manufacturers to sell their conventional products in these regions. Hence, they are bound to develop new products that fulfill environmental norms. It has, thus, become important for them to find a right balance between the product performance and content of their product.

Early buyers will receive 10% customization on reports. According to the estimates, Asia-Pacific leads the market for Agrochemicals with 41.3% share in demand at global level in 2012, followed by Latin America (17.0%), North America (15.4%), Europe (7.8%), and Rest of the World (18.5%). Looking at fertilizers type, Nitrogenous fertilizers occupied 68.4% and Organophosphates occupied 73.0% share in demand in their respective agrochemicals type.

The growth of the Agrochemicals Market has been studied through in-depth analysis of major factors that are driving the market such as growing population and increase in demand for food with opportunities in the development of environment friendly and rising consumer awareness for agrochemicals. However, the increasing environmental concerns and availability of other environment friendly alternatives are proving to be the major restraining factors for the market.

1678,"01:13 Tuesday 08 September 2015 The state of Britain's local roads is the number one gripe among drivers, according to a survey. 

One in 10 motorists said the condition of local roads was their top concern, while a further 20% listed it as one of their four main issues. 

The RAC said the figures show that councils should be under the same legal obligation to maintain roads as they are to provide minimum standards for education and social services. 

The Local Government Association (LGA) insisted that current funding levels mean councils cannot afford to carry out long-term improvements on roads.

Half of the 1,500 motorists polled believe the quality of roads in their area has deteriorated in the past 12 months with just 10% claiming it has improved. The remainder reported no change. 

The study was commissioned for the RAC's 2015 Report on Motoring. 

Among the 50% who believe the roads in their area are getting worse, the vast majority (99%) attribute this to potholes and general damage to the road surface. 

Litter is a source of annoyance for a quarter of people (24%), while poor maintenance of verges annoys one in five (21%).

RAC chief engineer David Bizley urged councils to spend more of their funds on repairing and replacing road surfaces. 

""They are under specific legal obligation to provide minimum standards in education and social services whereas their obligations to maintain roads are far less prescriptive,"" he said. 

""It is therefore inevitable that expenditure is biased against investment in the likes of road maintenance where prescriptive legal obligations do not exist and councillors therefore do not face legal sanctions.""

Mr Bizley warned there is a ""damaging disconnection"" between what a ""large proportion"" of council tax payers want local government to spend their money on and where it actually goes.

But councillor Peter Box, transport spokesman for the LGA, said councils have to prioritise their expenditure. 

"" While councils share the frustration of motorists at the state of our roads, it is impossible to compare repairing potholes with keeping children safe and caring for our elderly,"" he said. 

""With demand on these life and death services continuing to rise and funding from central government continuing to reduce, councils have little choice but to squeeze budgets for other services, such as maintaining our roads."" 

He added: ""Current funding levels mean councils are only able to keep pace with patching up our roads and filling potholes rather than carrying out more cost-effective and long-term improvements."" 

Michael Dugher, Labour's shadow transport secretary, said: ""Ministers are just not listening to motorists' concerns. They promised they would fix our local roads and the pothole crisis, but it was just all talk. 

""Road users have understandably had enough of their failure and broken promises."" 

But the Department for Transport (DfT) insisted that it was ""playing our part"". 

A DfT spokesman said: ""A well maintained local road network is essential for all road users. 

""We are playing our part by providing nearly £6 billion to councils in England to maintain local roads over the next six years. This funding includes incentives so councils plan ahead and repair roads properly so potholes never form in the first place.""

109,"We've got tips, tours and deals. 

The dollar may be down, but that doesn't mean packing away the passport permanently. In fact, New research, Expedia Value Tracker, reveals the best value spots for a Christmas trip overseas, and even the US figures as a possibility. That's because currency fluctuations are not the only monetary movement to factor in. Changes in accommodation, flight and living costs all contribute to the value of a holiday.

For instance, New Zealand is the only destination where the Australian dollar currently goes further than it did a year ago, up four per cent year-on-year. But the average accommodation cost there has risen nine per cent, while average flight prices between NZ and Australia have decreased five per cent. That all adds up to Expedia considering New Zealand the best value option for Aussies right now.

As for the US, the fact that flight costs have dipped 10 per cent in the past year offsets the dollar drop of 21 per cent and counting – a little. Expedia says travellers might find better value across the border in Canada this year, where the Australian dollar has only fallen six per cent against the Canadian dollar and flights decreased by six per cent year-on-year. That's especially relevant for those considering a Christmas ski break.

Expedia Australia and NZ managing director MD George Ruebensal suggests, however, you think creatively. ""If travellers are flexible about where they go, there are opportunities to save. And when thinking about Europe, that's exciting as there are so many amazing places to explore. For instance, why not consider Norway where the Aussie dollar has gained ground against the Norwegian krone and average hotel and flight prices have also decreased.""

The Aussie has also gained more than 30 per cent against the Russian ruble.

You can step by step learn the basics until you master it. Before you realize it, you are already a master in the dance floor. 
 
 
There are great video instructions online that you can access for a very affordable price. The good thing about this is that the people behind these videos are already experts of ballroom dancing, have been in the industry for many years and have the ability to teach you well. If you are lucky, you may get instruction videos from the very same instructors who teach the celebrities who joined the competition on the television. If those folks are able to learn a new ballroom dance every week, then you can learn easily and quickly at your home too. 
 
Each lesson comes with a short breakdown of the dance. It includes the history and helpful pointers, as well as showcasing a training video. You may start with the ballroom dance position video to acquire a sense of the basics, and may then proceed to clips in Foxtrot, Rumba, Mambo and more. You may as well utilize instructional videos for free through YouTube which offer dozens of user-submitted ballroom dancing clips. Look for the dance style you want to learn and then move on with the first result to other, relevant, videos that teach related steps. 
 
While videos might not be competent to substitute live courses of instruction for some students, recorded lessons can complement everything you learned in class, and also supply practice exercises, ideas and motivation. If you prefer this way of learning, remember that you still need to practice and may need some actual guidance with specific steps. The effectiveness of dance instruction videos will depend on the quality of the material and to your effort to learn. Once you learn the moves, you may now show-off in the dance floor together with your partner.

747,"Going to grad school is both time-consuming and expensive, so it’s not a decision to make lightly. How much more you can earn will depend on both your undergraduate degree and the graduate degree you’d pursue. This calculator shows how your lifetime earnings would increase (or even decrease) based on your choices. http://lifehacker.com/should-i-go-to... Should I Go to Grad School? Should I Go to Grad School? Should I Go to Grad School? Dear Lifehacker, My undergraduate studies are coming to an end, but I'm not sure I want to… Read more Read more The calculator is on Quartz and the data comes from online lender SoFi, which analyzed data from 200,000 of its users who tried to refinance their student loans over the past year.
Advertisement Select your undergraduate degree field and on the right side of the chart you can see how much your median lifetime earnings would increase based on the graduate degree. Most of these are just as you would expect. If you have a degree in the humanities, getting an MA or MS in Humanities would boost your lifetime income 8.4%—a difference of $223,660 over your lifetime—compared to an increase of 175.7% if you went to dental school, a difference of $7,101,330. Granted, dental school takes longer and is more expensive. SoFi’s calculations also take into account income lost while you’re in school and student loan costs. The good news is that in all but four combinations, a graduate degree leads to higher median lifetime earnings. The exceptions, as Quartz reports: The glaring exception: People who got a bachelor’s in engineering, business, finance, or economics, and then pursued a graduate degree in fine arts, humanities, or social sciences. For instance, SoFi found that someone who got a bachelor’s degree in engineering saw their median lifetime earnings drop by 17% after getting a Master’s in fine arts. Sorry, MFA grads, but good news MBA students: No matter what your undergraduate major, an MBA boosts median lifetime earnings between 34% and 89%. If the data here doesn’t help you decide, you can calculate whether grad school is worth it for your particular situation and use the one-year salary rule of thumb to decide if getting a student loan for that degree will pay off. Should you go to graduate school? Yes. Maybe.

Two YouTube films published in the Saudi daily 'Sabq' showed hundreds of birds flocked cheerfully on the swamp before they were shot and their carcasses were piled up in a truck. 

One film showed the two Saudis boasted about killing the birds in large numbers and the paper quoted viewers as saying authorities must track down the two hunters and punish them. It noted that their car number appeared in the film. 

It was not clear where in Saudi Arabia the incident took place and whether the swamp was made by the two hunters as a snare for the thirsty birds.",d1e4e64c-a700-4191-a3d3-bb030c741a24,News,2015-09-06T07:19:02Z,Emirates247,Video: Birds massacred at Saudi desert swamp,0.0,News

2374,"By Minggu Simon Lhasa 
BANGKOK, Sept 1 (Bernama) -- Thai security authorities arrested a foreigner suspected of being involved in the bomb attacks in Bangkok last week in a province close to the Thai-Cambodia border. 

Prime Minister General Prayuth Chan-ocha, said the male suspect was arrested this morning in Thai territory, indicating that the country has achieved a lot of progress in the case since the arrest of the first suspect on Saturday. 

""I have been informed about the suspect's arrest during lunch time. He was arrested in Parai village in Sakeaw province,"" he announced in a media briefing this afternoon. 

He described the man as an important suspect. Sakaew province is located in the eastern part of Thailand and about three hours' drive from Bangkok. 

While the Thai authority is reluctant to name the suspect or his nationality, the social media already provided the information. 

According to the info in social media, Twitter, LINE chat application and Facebook, the latest suspect who was arrested today is a 25-year-old Chinese national who came from Xinjiang, the home province of Muslim Uighur ethnic group. 

He is charged with exiting Thailand without permission. 

Meanwhile, Thai police spokesman Police Lieutenant General Prawuth Thavornsiri said the suspect is believed to be in the same group of the first suspect arrested last Saturday that was responsible for the bomb attacks in Bangkok. 

The suspect was detained and was under questioning at a military camp, Prawuth said. 

He said witnesses were also asked to identify and confirm the suspect, and DNA from the suspect will be compared with the DNA found in the rented rooms that were raided by the authorities a few days ago in the districts of Minburi and Nong Chok, both in Bangkok. 

So far, the Thai court has issued warrants of arrest for seven suspects in connection with the two bomb attacks in Bangkok, one at the Erawan shrine at Ratchaprasong intersection in central Bangkok and another at Sathorn pier at the Chao Phraya river. 

The Minburi Court today issued warrants of arrest against three foreign male suspects, but the police refused to reveal their nationalities. 

Yesterday, the same court issued two warrants of arrest for a Thai Muslim woman, 26-year-old Wanna Suansan, who is believed to be in Turkey at the moment and an unidentified man. 

The Royal Thai Police chief, Police General Somyot Pumpanmuang said Wanna who is considered as a suspect has contacted the authority and wanted to return to Thailand to clear her name. 

However, there is still no date yet of her return, he added. 

In the same case last week, two warrants of arrest were issued against the bomber at the Erawan shrine, identified only as the man in a yellow shirt and just a police sketch, and an unidentified man in relation to the bomb attack at Sathorn pier.

4083,"Story highlights Swiss prosecutors open criminal proceedings against Sepp Blatter Blatter's lawyer says ""no mismanagement occurred"" FIFA says it is cooperating with investigation UEFA yet to comment on situation 
A statement released by the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) of Switzerland confirmed it was examining a contract signed by Blatter with the Caribbean Football Union and an alleged ""disloyal payment"" of $2 million to UEFA president Michel Platini. 

Former senior FIFA official Warner was indicted in the wide-ranging bribery scandal, while Platini entered the race to succeed Blatter as FIFA president in July. 

The statement was released after Blatter, who has been in charge of soccer's world governing body since 1998, was interrogated by OAG representatives Friday following a meeting of the FIFA Executive committee in Zurich. 

Blatter's lawyer Richard Cullen, said that ""no mismanagement occurred."" 

In a statement sent to CNN, Cullen said: ""We're confident that when the Swiss authorities have a chance to review the documents and the evidence they will see that the contract was properly prepared and negotiated by the appropriate staff members of FIFA."" 

The OAG confirmed that it had conducted a search at FIFA headquarters with the help of the police -- including Blatter's office -- and ""data seized."" 

""The OAG suspects that on 12 September 2005 Mr. Joseph Blatter has signed a contract with the Caribbean Football Union (with Jack Warner as the President at this time); this contract was unfavorable for FIFA,"" said the statement. 

""On the other hand, there is as suspicion that, in the implementation of this agreement, Joseph Blatter also violated his fiduciary duties and acted against the interest of FIFA and/or FIFA Marketing & TV AG. 

""Additionally, Mr. Joseph Blatter is suspected of a disloyal payment of two million Swiss Francs to Michel Platini, President of Union of European Football Association (UEFA), at the expense of FIFA, which was allegedly made for work performed between January 1999 and June 2002 ; this payment was executed in February 2011,"" added the statement. 

UEFA was not immediately available for comment after the OAG said that Platini had been ""heard as a person asked to provide information,"" while one of Warner's officials told CNN ""he wouldn't be saying anything."" 

Platini, who became president of Uefa -- the European governing body in 2007 -- is also a vice-president of FIFA. 

The 60-year-old became a member of FIFA's executive committee in 2002 as well as chairman of the technical development committee and worked on the 2006 World Cup organizing committee . 

In a statement, FIFA said it had been ""cooperating"" and has ""complied with all requests for documents, date and other information."" 

It added: ""We will continue this level of cooperation throughout the investigation. We will have no further comment on the matter as it is an active investigation."" 

The incident comes eight days after Secretary General Jerome Valcke was suspended by FIFA, while the organization investigates allegations he participated in a scheme to profit off the sale of World Cup tickets on the black market. 

Valcke has been relieved of his duties until further notice. 

FIFA was plunged into crisis in late May when seven officials were charged for racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering by the FBI. 

The charges are part of a U.S. prosecution that indicted a total of 14 people from around the globe. 

Meanwhile, a separate probe by Swiss authorities is investigating potential corruption into the bidding process for both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups , which will be hosted by Russia and Qatar. 

Qatar's controversial bid for the latter was backed by Platini, and the tournament has since been switched from the emirate's summer months to the winter following concerns over unsafe temperatures. 

Platini, South Korea billionaire Chung Mong-Joon, Jordan's Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein, ex-Brazil player Zico and Liberian FA chairman Musa Bility have all announced their intention to run for president. 

To stand in the February 2016 presidential election, candidates will need letters of support from at least five FIFA member nations. 
U.S investigation 
Meanwhile, a U.S. law enforcement official says the U.S. Justice Department is coordinating and sharing information with the OAG on the ongoing FIFA investigation. 

Blatter is among the senior FIFA officials who remain under investigation, U.S. law enforcement officials told CNN. 

The importance of the Swiss investigation against Blatter is that while the FBI has been focusing on his possible role in FIFA corruption, there are limits to U.S. jurisdiction. 

U.S. prosecutors have claimed jurisdiction based on the fact financial transactions that are part of the alleged bribery schemes used U.S. banks or occurred in the U.S. 

The U.S. investigators have had some trouble directly linking Blatter to those U.S. transactions, according to a U.S. official familiar with the investigation. Swiss investigators may have an easier time making those links, if they exist, since Blatter is based there.

3711,"TIP OF THE WEEK No matter where you turn, pattern inspiration is all around you - from modern architecture and traditional flooring to animal furs, floral arrangements and fashion runways. As homeowners and designers look to personalize spaces and create impactful interiors, patterns are being replicated with paint on walls, floors, furniture and more. “Pattern always catches my eye and is my go-to element for adding something special to a space,” said Grace Bonney, design expert, founder of Design*Sponge and author of the best-selling book “Design*Sponge at Home.” ScotchBlue Brand partnered with Patternbank, experts in modern style and design, to analyze the world of pattern and forecast up-and-coming trends that can help take your home from boring to beautiful by adding depth, color and personality. * Striking Linework: The once simple stripe has found new life with a bold, modern twist. Sharp angles and a fractured, abstract look bring dimension to the standard stripe, and add strong visual impact to even the most awkward spaces around the home. Consider using neutral paint colors for more traditional and elegant looks or brighter colors to infuse energy into the space. * Mod Optic: Bold geometric designs are making their way into home decor with subtle shifts in scale and color. These strong three-dimensional patterns create a clean, modern style that communicates sophistication and audacity. Infuse contrast and depth to create a clean, modern backdrop for existing decor. The pattern allows you to play with a combination of light and dark colors as a way to add different levels of drama based on the space. * Geo Elemental: From north and south to east and west, global influences can be seen in architecture, interior design and on the fashion runways. Merging traditional shapes such as zigzags and diamonds with various color treatments adds a modern feel to deep-rooted tradition, creating a meeting point for contemporary and universal. The lively repetition of eye-catching, sharp lines is ideal for spaces that draw attention in one direction and evoke a strong sense of place. Using earth tones and natural colors add to the global feel of the pattern, while cool neutral colors provide a calming aura.

1980,"The house-hunting is going slowly for Reggie Jackson. 

Jackson, the Pistons' starting point guard, is looking at several areas in close proximity to his nightly workplace - the Palace. 

Though Jackson's ultimate residence is still in question, he has started establishing one fact. 

During this streak of six seasons missing the playoffs, leadership has been a big question mark with the Pistons. But observers - including coach Stan Van Gundy - say Jackson has emerged as a main guy. 

""He's the guy trying to pull it together,"" Van Gundy said Friday. 

Jackson, a 25-year-old military brat, said leadership could come naturally for someone who is a good follower and listener. 

""The best leaders are normally the best followers,"" Jackson said. ""I have a tendency - I want to do everything perfect. I want to know why it works, why it doesn't work and everybody's position on the floor. I like to know what's going on. 

""Everybody doesn't deliver the message well, but you have to filter out and listen to the message. I think that goes a long ways. I think a lot of my leadership comes from being willing to listen and in following. If I know how to do things right, then I feel like I'm confident enough to steer you in the right direction without hindering you, questioning myself if I'm giving you good advice."" 

The Pistons acquired Jackson from the Oklahoma City Thunder at February's trade deadline. Because he was an impending restricted free agent, some observers thought the Pistons were kicking the tires, but Van Gundy insisted ""this isn't a tryout"" and the Pistons were going to sign Jackson. 

But the Pistons suffered through a 10-game losing streak shortly after Jackson's arrival. And Jackson admitted struggling while trying to balance his newness to the locker room with his leadership responsibilities. 

But a talk with Van Gundy settled things. 

Jackson said Van Gundy told him to find a way to fit in first and let the guys get to know you. 

""They have to trust you before they follow you,"" Jackson recalled Van Gundy saying. 

Jackson relaxed, and he started playing well. 

He excelled down the stretch and put up solid averages of 17.6 points and 9.2 assists while shooting 44 percent over 27 games. 

Jackson - like other free agents - benefited from the NBA's exploding salary cap. He signed a five-year, $80-million deal. 

Jackson is quick to say leadership isn't just his responsibility. 

Center Andre Drummond - poised to become the highest-paid Piston ever - desperately wants to provide leadership. Rookie small forward Stanley Johnson looks as if he eventually will emerge as a strong locker-room voice. 

""I probably bear a lot of the weight in terms of leadership,"" Jackson said, ""but everybody does their part, and that makes it easier. We have a locker room full of guys that are hungry to win, and we're trying to mesh all together and just make it work."" 

But as the point guard - who has the ball most often - Jackson will have primary leadership responsibility. 

And with a five-year deal in hand, Jackson is ready to take ownership. 

""Not having an opt-out or anything here, it's good to know that I'm locked here for five years and someone wants me,"" Jackson said. ""Hopefully we do this thing right where we don't have a new regime or changeover and that I'm literally here for five years. 

""That's a great feeling to know somebody wants you for that long. They believe in you, and I have the backing of my teammates, and I have the backing of the staff here. So I'll just put in the work and find ways to get the best results for myself and my teammates every night.""",a9f74632-228d-4cfc-a771-74917a711ac5,News,2015-09-28T08:00:00Z,KansasCity.com,Pistons' Jackson emerging as team's leader,0.0,News
244,"Lewis Hamilton took his fortieth victory of his Formula 1 career at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza to extend his championship lead to 53 points as his Mercedes AMG PETRONAS team-mate and closest rival Nico Rosberg was forced to retire with two laps remaining due to an engine failure. 
 
However the race win was in doubt when the stewards announced they were investigation both Hamilton and Rosberg for having under-inflated tyres pre-race, with the race winner running 0.3psi below Pirelli ’s 19.5psi guidelines. 
 
However after the investigation, the stewards decided to take no action, and having controlled the race from the start, Hamilton was able to take home the twenty-five points on offer, winning the race by 25.042s from Scuderia Ferrari’ s Sebastian Vettel . 
 
Vettel drove a relatively lonely race after jumping ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen at the start as the Finn made a mess of his getaway, dropping from second on the grid to the rear of the field, but fought back superbly to take fifth at the chequered flag. 
 
Completing the podium was former Ferrari driver Felipe Massa , who held off the late advances of Williams Martini Racing team-mate Valtteri Bottas , but both inherited their places when Rosberg’s engine expired while running third and catching Vettel. 
 
Behind Raikkonen in fifth was Sergio Perez of the Sahara Force India team, who consolidated his Spa-Francorchamps form from two weeks ago to claim sixth, just ahead of team-mate Nico Hulkenberg , while Daniel Ricciardo climbed from the back of the field to finish eighth for Infiniti Red Bull Racing . 
 
Marcus Ericsson secured his third points finish in as many races with a good drive in his Sauber to ninth, with the second Red Bull of Daniil Kvyat completing the top ten. 
 
The Scuderia Toro Rosso ’s missed out on points after their engine chances, with Carlos Sainz Jr eleventh and Max Verstappen , including taking his drive-through penalty at the end of the opening lap, twelfth, while the second Sauber of Felipe Nasr was thirteenth after a pit stop on the opening lap to change his front wing. 
 
Jenson Button was the sole McLaren-Honda to see the chequered flag in fourteenth having run inside the top ten in the opening couple of laps after a good start, but team-mate Fernando Alonso was a late casualty, retiring with three laps remaining with an electrical issue. 
 
The two Manor F1 Team drivers both saw the chequered flag, with Will Stevens ahead of Roberto Merhi , while both Lotus F1 Team drivers were out by the end of the second lap with un-repairable damage to their E23 Hybrids.

3442,"The psychology behind successful Web design Posted by : brij fbEducator Wednesday, 30 September 2015 As designers, we are user advocates first and foremost. We need to understand what users want versus need before they ever encounter our designs. Once they do encounter it, they must first feel safe and comfortable. This sometimes contrasts with our desire to innovate – which is why we have to align that desire with user goals. To do this, we need to grasp how our users’ brains work— the mental models they’ve created that help them navigate the Web. This understanding then gives us a platform from which to create, a process called neurodesign (introduced back in 2012). Photo…

3720,"Android 6.0, known as ""Marshmallow"" is nearly here on Google Nexus devices yet only 21 percent of Androids currently run on Android 5.0, aka: Lollipop.
The figures are based on Google's own data; the company routinely tells developers the percentage of devices hitting the Google Play Store running on each Android version. The latest figures were taken over a 7-day period ending on September 7.
Here's how Apple will ensure your iPhone can fit the iOS 9 upgrade Read More The adoption rate for the latest Android software sorely lacks behind that of iOS, although with iOS 8 last year, Apple's own adoption rates were lower than in years past.
The main reason for the sluggish upgrade numbers was a lack of free space available on some iPhone models. Apple says it won't have that problem this time around with iOS 9.
While Google Play Services have helped mitigate Android's version fragmentation, it doesn't completely resolve the issue.
Numerous developers have reached out to me citing that they're still constrained by the new APIs Google introduces with each version of Android. Google Play Services can only help with that challenge so much, leaving developers to target more recent handsets with their apps. Perhaps that's another reason developer interest in iOS 9 is greatly on the rise in certain circles. Google expects to launch Android 6.0 later this year -- possibly later this month with a pair of Nexus handsets -- and the upgrade cycle will begin again. With handset makers and carriers slowing down the process, I suspect the adoption figures next year will follow suit.",a544e892-4148-4959-b8df-2014b5870a11,Blog,2015-09-09T15:12:51Z,Latest topics for ZDNet in Mobility,"With Marshmallow still toasting, 1 in 5 Android devices run Lollipop",1.0,News
4841,"Pope Francis will be arriving in the U.S. today, Tuesday. He has a crowded schedule ahead of him this week, with stops in Washington, D.C., New York, and Philadelphia. Among his other events, on Thursday he will be addressing a joint session of Congress--the first religious leader to do so.
 
 I sincerely hope the pope's trip goes well. His visit means a lot to millions of my fellow Americans. Although I do not share their religious beliefs, I can understand their enthusiasm and I respect their right to practice their religion, including holding mass events to celebrate the presence of the leader of their church.
 
 Sure, getting around the D.C. area, which is where I live and work, will be a nightmare, but given the traffic congestion we normally have, as well as our dysfunctional subway system, the difference in the level of gridlock will be a difference in degree rather than a difference in kind. We'll survive.
 
 And, as surveys confirm, even those of us who are not Catholic seem to like Pope Francis. He doesn't appear to be as much of a scold as Pope Benedict or John Paul II. Moreover, although he has not undertaken anything resembling a radical reform of the Church's antiquated, rigid doctrines or its ossified structure, he does seem to be a more compassionate figure, as indicated, for example, by his taking steps to make the Catholic Church more welcoming to gays and lesbians.
 
 That said, there is one aspect of his visit which bothers me, namely, the aforementioned address to a joint session of Congress. This sets an unfortunate and dangerous precedent. A religious leader has no business addressing the legislature of a secular nation.
 
 Please don't try to diminish the significance of this precedent by saying that Pope Francis is just another head of state. Everyone knows that the sovereignty of Vatican City is a legal fiction. Like many legal fictions it has served a useful purpose. Its creation in 1929 resolved a long-running dispute between the Catholic Church and Italy. (Indeed, it may be one of the few good, creative ideas that Mussolini had.) But the pope is not here because he is the theocratic ruler of 100 acres, nor was he invited to speak before Congress because of the tremendous power that Vatican City has as a nation. Pope Francis is here on a visit to the faithful of his church, and he was invited to speak before Congress because he is a spiritual leader of over 1 billion people, including about 70 million Americans.
 
 A bedrock principle of our secular democracy is that the government has no business interfering in religious matters, and it certainly has no right to show preferential treatment to a religious leader simply because many more Americans belong to his religious body. The truth of religious claims is not resolved by a popular vote. If we invite Pope Francis, the alleged Vicar of Christ, to address Congress, why not Thomas Monson, the Prophet who leads the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints? 
 
 Furthermore, on what authority is Pope Francis going to predicate his address to Congress? When leaders of foreign states (real, not fictional states) address Congress, they provide the perspective of their country on matters of interest to the Congress of the United States. Pope Francis is going to present the perspective of -- who? God?
 
 Just as it is a cornerstone of our democracy that the government does not interfere with religious matters, likewise it is a fundamental principle of our democracy that religious doctrine should play no role in shaping government policy. The religious views of Pope Francis, whether laudable or lamentable, have no relevance to the policies and legislation of a secular state. At some point, you can bet Pope Francis is going to reference his understanding of God's word and the implications this has for our policies. But he has no standing to tell Congress or us what we should do based on his religious beliefs.
 
 Congress should never have invited Pope Francis to speak, and, to show respect for our secular democracy, he should have declined the invitation.

2089,"Fairfax Media was recognised at the 2015 Our Watch awards on Thursday night for its exemplary reporting of domestic violence, receiving the award for best journalism campaign. Fairfax Media was recognised at the 2015 Our Watch awards on Thursday night for its exemplary reporting of domestic violence, receiving the award for best journalism campaign. The multi-platform Fairfax Media ""Shine a Light"" campaign was a body of work both thought- and action-provoking published across titles The Sydney Morning Herald, The Sun Herald, Daily Life and smh.com.au.

The campaign, which gave prominence to the extent and impact of domestic violence in NSW, was a group submission by Fairfax journalists Nick Ralston, Josephine Tovey, Rachel Olding, Amy Corderoy and Candice Chung.

​The Our Watch judges Kelly Banister, Andrew Eales and Lisa Wilkinson commended the campaign for partnering industry-leading journalism with interactive responses to family violence. ""From exclusive page one stories to fearless opinion pieces, the Fairfax Media team's approach to creating awareness across media platforms was outstanding,"" they said.

""I think the thing that was so special about this campaign was how it really was a whole-of-Fairfax project. Domestic violence has a huge impact on every part of Australian life, so to cover it properly we needed to have the input in expert reporters covering crime, social affairs, health and more,"" Amy Corderoy, Sydney Morning Herald health editor, said.

""It was also really important the way it was backed by our editor-in-chief, Darren Goodsir, and all the news directors and platform editors, so we were able to have a massive impact across a range of platforms. But the biggest thing was how our audience responded, showing they cared about these women, wanted to share their stories and stop these awful tragedies from continuing.""

The hashtag #shinealight was shared tens of thousands of times on social media, reaching a combined audience of more than one million.

Jess Hill won three awards, including the inaugural Our Watch award, for her work published in The Monthly, The Guardian and on Radio National ABC. Best use of social media was awarded to Destroy the Joint team, and Jayne Margetts and the ABC News Team were winners of best news coverage. Best local/community journalism went to Simon Mann, Bec Zajac and Ania Dutka from The Citizen.

2498,"Geechi Mouf is an American rapper and songwriter, and also the founder and CEO of Hav-Not Muzic Group Record Label. He is most known for the rising popularity of his hit single “Cold Turkey” which covers the controversial topic of dealing drugs. 
 
Synopsis: 
Geechi Mouf was born Beau Knox, in 1978 Volusia County, Florida, on October 26, 1978. Raised in Deland, Florida, Geechi was influenced by street-oriented rappers like 8Ball & MJG, Trick Daddy, Tupac, Master P. 
During his incarceration in 1998, he began to write rap lyrics of his own 
that geared toward the street life and drug dealing & money. Known then as Lil Loc formed Tha Hav-Notz and joined a rap group from his 
neighborhood which combined local rap groups and solo acts forming C.O.D (City of DeLand). 
In 2000, Geechi Mouf (then Lil Loc) and Tha Hav-Notz signed to Full Moon Records, an independent record label owned by Brain “DJ FURY”Graham, a Southern bass legend”. However,the label folded 
the following year and The Hav-Notz were released from their contract. 
In 2003, Geechi Mouf and the group began working with Tra Thomas, a former NFL athlete, who funded their early rap careers and moved 
them to New York. 
 
After yielding little success, Geechi Mouf and Tha Hav-Notz decided to head back to Florida. Shortly after their move back to Florida, Geechi Mouf learned how to engineer his own music and began the DIY-method of building and structuring Hav-Not Muzic Group. 
In 2014, Geechi Mouf released his first mix tape under the HNMG recording label, entitled A Mouf Full which featured his first single “MJ KILLA”. 
His follow up debut “Cold Turkey” which tackled his controversial lifestyle as a drug dealer, was released in early 2015, and has since gained popularity across the southern regions of the United States.

389,"Left: Jennifer Lien on Another World. Roger: Lien's mugshot from the
Roane County Police Department. Former Another World actress Jennifer Lien was arrested and has been in custody for two weeks after allegedly exposing herself in front of several children, Roane County police confirm.
Lien has been charged with two misdemeanor counts of indecent exposure in an incident that happened on August 31 in Harriman, Tennessee.
A neighbor of Lien’s made a complaint to police after Lien began a tirade due to a crying child, and during her tirade, exposed her breasts and buttocks. The neighbor stated that she had three children in the yard while this was happening.
According to a Roane County Sheriff’s Office report, when police appeared on September 3 with a warrant, Lien was not wearing clothes and resisted arrest.
“The offender stated she wasn’t going any f–king where and we needed to leave her alone,” reads the police report by responding officer Billy Walker.
Lien also threatened to have the officers shot and killed, says the police report. She was transported to the patrol car and taken to the Roane County Jail, and is scheduled to appear in court on December 7.
Lien played Hannah Moore on Another World in 1991 to 1992. She later starred on Star Trek: Voyager from 1995 to 2000 as Kes. Her other credits include American History X, Accidents Don’t Happen, Men in Black: The Series, Battle Force: Andromeda and voice work in Lion King 2: Simba’s Pride.
Lien had another run-in with the law earlier this year. In April, she was arrested and charged with evading arrest, resisting arrest, reckless endangerment and aggravated assault.

2458,"Legislative Council president Jasper Tsang Yok-sing and House Committee chairman Andrew Leung Kwan-yuen failed to appear at Eastern Court yesterday, in response to summonses to act as witnesses in the case of 12 activists who pleaded not guilty to storming the Legco complex in June last year.

Lo & Lo, a law firm representing the Legco Commission, issued a letter saying both Tsang and Leung were busy at work and would like to cancel the summonses.

The lawyers suggested a few candidates to replace the pair.

Legco's representative lawyer Wong Sze-wing told magistrate Jason Wan Siu-ming that the reason for calling police was clearly explained in the press release issued by Legco the day after the June 13 protest.

 She said the prosecution planned to summon Legco's assistant secretary general Matthew Loo Sze-yuen to testify, saying she believed Lo's testimony would be more straightforward.

Thirteen protesters faced the dock for the incident during the protest outside the Legco complex, when the controversial northeast New Territories development was being debated.

The 12 activists, aged between 21 and 40, include students from Lingnan University, City University, League of Social Democrats member Yim Man-wah, and People's Liberation Army barracks trespasser Billy Chiu Hin- chung.

Another activist, Wong Kan- yuen, 24, pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful assembly and one of attempted forcible entry.

Last week, Wong was jailed for three weeks after being convicted of another charge of violating Legco's administrative instructions, but has been released on bail pending appeal.

The court heard the 13 defendants tried to force open the glass door on the ground floor of Legco complex, causing damage amounting to more than HK$421,000.

Leung Hiu-yeung, 21, and Raphael Wong Ho-ming, 26, also denied obstructing a Legco officer who fractured his left toe.

The trial continues today for the 12.

1378,"BERKELEY HEIGHTS, N.J. - Lori Cicali looks at insurance this way, ""People have to have it, but they don't appreciate it until there's a claim (to file). Then they get it."" 
 
Cicali is the owner of the Allstate Insurance Agency at 302 Springfield Ave., and has been affiliated with Allstate for more than 23 years.  She said she began working with her personal Allstate Insurance agent when her children were five, eight and 10 and she was thinking about joining ""the workforce. My agent said, 'Why don't you come to work for me,'"" and she did. 
 
Over the years, she worked for a few different agencies, learning the business, then Allstate changed its business model and the agents were allowed to sell their businesses. When ""one of the first agencies came up for sale, I was there,"" she said. That was when, 15 years ago this past April, she bought the Berkeley Heights agency. 

Sign Up for E-News 
 
While ""insurance itself is not fun, the people you meet"" make the business rewarding and, often fun, she said. Being an agent is all about ""building relationships with people over the years,"" she said. Sometimes, you first meet a young couple when they are buying insurance on their first apartment.  As the years pass, the agent helps them purchase insurance for their first house, cars and life insurance for themselves and their children, as well as other products. 
 
""The most meaningful thing is when you give a death claim check to a family member. Many times, they don't know they have insurance,"" she said. ""It's a horrible time, but you know you were part of getting them insurance, so the family has something to fall back on."" 
 
Things are changing in the insurance industry. ""Allstate is a very solid, stable company,"" which has agents in local communities, she said. ""People are starting to see 1-800 numbers to call for insurance. Call centers work for some people, but not everyone,"" she said. ""I sell relationships, not just insurance."" 
 
Cicali is involved with the community, in June, she received the Agency Hands in the Community Award for her commitment to helping others, including a $1,000 grant from The Allstate Foundation for the YWCA of Eastern Union County. Last year, she received two $1,000 grants from the foundation -- one for the Summit Lions Foundation, the other for the Suburban Chambers Foundation in Summit, where Cicali is a volunteer. 
 
Often people don't know exactly what is covered in their insurance policy, because, ""they seldom read their policy. We're here to educate them,"" she said. If something happens and they don't know if the policy covers it, for example a tree falling and hitting the house, ""they can call us"" and the agent can explain what is covered, she said. 
 
If something is covered, ""We help them thru the claim process to ensure the claim is settled efficiently,"" she said. In the end, the agent is an advocate for both the insurance company and for the consumer.  
 
Agents are not just salespeople, they make sure the client has the proper coverage for their personal needs. ""We need to know about the person ... their assets, background, occupation,"" to make sure they have the proper coverage. ""A life insurance policy is not just to cover the mortgage,"" she said. 
 
The agency is a ""full service insurance agency,"" she said.  It offers all property, casualty, and commercial lines, as well as life insurance, workplace benefits, group life and group disability, long term care and critical illness insurance and financial services,"" she said. 
 
Her advice for the younger generation is to ""start with renter's insurance,"" which she concedes, they don't see the value of, and to ""get life insurance at a young age.""  The life insurance is especially important because ""there's more likelihood of a person dying or being disabled than a homeowner's claim,"" she said. 
 
One thing Cicali wants everyone to know about her business is that it isn't a solo operation, ""I can't do this without my associates. They are all licensed individuals,"" and part of the team. 
 
To reach Cicali, call 908-464-4500, or visit her",1725bf27-10d8-425a-bb1e-b1cf1817715e,News,2015-09-24T15:22:19Z,TAPinto.net,"Allstate Agent Lori Cicali Sells Relationships, Not Just Insurance",0.0,Blog
2537,"ANDERSON – Beverly King tapped her foot along to “Devil Went Down to Georgia” and occasionally sang a phrase of the popular country tune “Friends in Low Places” sung by My Yellow Rickshaw on Sunday at the city’s Labor Day Bash in Shadyside Park.

But when the versatile Indianapolis-based band broke out its hip-hop medley spanning from the ‘80s to today, King jumped out of her red lawn chair to bust a move to “Gangster’s Paradise,” “Party Up (Up in Here)” and “Thrift Shop.”

“I came out to party,” the lifelong Anderson resident said. “I am blessed to be here.”

She was one of hundreds of people who cascaded down the hill west of the playground at Shadyside on blankets and in lawn chairs to hear My Yellow Rickshaw and another popular Indianapolis band, Toy Factory.

The bash was one of several events around the county, including a concert featuring The Daddy-O’s at Elwood’s Callaway Park.

Some brought their own refreshments, rolling coolers along the walkways and cooking out, while others took advantage of the vendors brought by the city to provide barbecue, ice cream and lemon shakeups to celebrate the last big holiday of the summer.

Mayor Kevin Smith also took the opportunity to mingle with the concert-goers.

“Do you feel that sense of community?” he asked the audience. “That’s what Anderson is getting back to. That’s where we’re going.”

Anderson residents Greg and Liza Pierce couldn’t wait to get the party started, dancing to the Michael Jackson recording “PYT,” Kool and the Gang’s “Celebration” and Beyonce’s “Love On Top” between bands.

The Pierces, and Anderson residents Bea Brumback and her daughter Meranda Turner, said having the event on the day before Labor Day was a good idea.

“We wouldn’t be here tomorrow,” said Greg Pierce, who plans to cook out at home.

“A lot of people have plans for tomorrow. I know we do,” Bea Brumback said.

Brumback said she likes the many events the city offers, including the recent sesquicentennial events.

“I participate in all of them all the time,” she said.

Labor Day picnic

The Madison County Solidarity Labor Council’s annual Labor Day picnic is scheduled from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. today at Beulah Park in Alexandria.

2767,"Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch has lent his voice to the refugee crisis by fronting a short film in aid of Save The Children. 
 
		 
The film, titled Help Is Coming, ties in with the release of a limited edition 7"" and download of Crowded House's song by the same name. 
  Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch is fronting a short film for Save the Children's efforts to help the refugee crisis (Save The Children/PA)   
It is directed by Mat Whitecross and sees Cumberbatch  doing a short introduction, reciting a few lines from poet  Warsan Shire's Home. 

			 
He then ends his short introduction saying: ""As people watching this tragedy unfold from the safely of our homes, with our safe children, we want to say that we see you, we hear you and help is coming."" 



 
The project has been spearheaded by writer Caitlin Moran and broadcaster  Pete Paphides, who were both "" saddened and angered last week by the images of three-year-old Syrian refugee Aylan Kurdi and his brother Galip."" 

Moran said: "" Whilst committees convene and resolutions are published and squabbles break out between this government and that, normal people just become very practical: they roll up their sleeves and say, 'Right, if I'd just fled my country with my family, what would I need?'"" 

""Shelter, food, and clothing, maybe some books for the kids. Let's get started now."" 

""So, Pete and I were just doing what everyone else was doing, really. He'd found the perfect song - Help Is Coming, about refugees on their way to Ellis Island, with 'Empires crumbling' behind them, and I just went on Facebook and told everyone what we were doing. And everyone was desperate to help, everyone felt the same way."" 

			 
Within a few hours they had people offering help and support for the project. 

The 7"" single comes with an  exclusive and previously unreleased B-side, Anthem. It also features new artwork by Crowded House's bass player Nick Seymour. 

Apple, which will make the download available, will donate all proceeds to Save The Children. 

Crowded House's Neil Finn and Capitol Records will also donate all of their royalties and proceeds from the track to Save The Children. 

			 
Finn said: ""First recorded in 1995, quietly released in 1999, Help Is Coming has had a long journey to find a good home. 

""It was always a song about refugees, even if at the time I was thinking about the immigrants setting off on ships from Europe to America, looking for a better life for their families in America."" 

He added: ""There is such a huge scale and urgency to the current refugee crises that barely a day goes by without some crushing image or news account to confront us. We can't be silent any more.""

3867,"As the long awaited FOMC decision approaches one week from today opinions seem split as to whether the Fed will raise rates or wait until October or December. If the focus was solely on domestic factors the decision would be an easy one. However, there are external influences that go beyond just the domestic economy that cloud the outlook.

One of these factors is the value of the US dollar and the question is does it matter? Perhaps I should ask, how much does it matter? While not an overriding factor it is one that appears to be part of the decision making process as indicated in the minutes from the July 28-29 FOMC meeting:

Some participants also discussed the risk that a possible divergence in interest rates in the United States and abroad might lead to further appreciation of the dollar, extending the downward pressure on commodity prices and the weakness in net exports.

It is not clear what currencies the Fed is looking at in the forex market. Is it the trade weighted dollar, commodity currencies, major currencies such as the EUR and JPY, the Chinese currency after the recent devaluation, battered emerging market currencies or a combination of these currencies? 

This is important in the run up to the FOMC meeting as the current picture in the forex market is mixed, with currencies such as the EUR and JPY benefiting from safe haven flows and carry trade unwinding while the dollar is generally bid elsewhere. Add in recent equity market volatility that is driving forex rates and the Fed will have more on its plate as it debates whether it is time to raise rates. 

The point is that it is not enough to talk about the dollar in general terms. It is also not clear how much the dollar matters as Fed Vice Chairman Fischer made no mention of it in his latest speech at Jackson Hole. On the other hand, the latest minutes indicated it is in the decision making mix so while not likely to be an overriding factor, the value of the dollar should be watched ahead of the September 17 decision although it is not clear which dollar(s) the Fed is focusing on.

Hawke's Bay successfully defended the Ranfurly Shield as they moved top of the Championship table with a 23-17 win over Bay of Plenty in the ITM Cup. 
 
The boot of Nick Evemy and try from Shahn Eru put Bay of Plenty in early control of Saturday's clash in Napier, however Zak Hohneck's yellow card in the 35th minute proved pivotal. 
 
In the absence of their scrum-half, the visitors struggled and Hawke's Bay took full advantage as Ihala West kicked a penalty and conversion either side of Tom Stanley's try early in the second half. 
 
A Tony Lamborn score extended Hawke's Bay's advantage further, and although Evemy converted his own try after 52 minutes it was not enough for Bay of Plenty. 
 
Southland produced a stunning display against Manawatu to end their run of four successive defeats, the Championship side beating their Premiership visitors 49-14. 
 
There were six different try scorers for the hosts as they collected a much-needed bonus point to keep their semi-final hopes alive. 
 
Mike Molloy, Tim Boys and Kieran Moffat gave Southland control of proceedings with first half tries, and they continued to run Manawatu – who lost Semisi Masirewa to injury – ragged in the second half with another three scores – with Lima Sopoaga scoring 22 points.

1902,"A day after his team may have turned a corner, Johnny Cueto wants to keep showing that he has, too. 
 
The right-hander hopes to build on a breakthrough effort as the Royals look to wrap up their first division title in 30 years Thursday night against the visiting Seattle Mariners. 
 
Cueto's surprising struggles were one reason Kansas City starters posted a 6.00 ERA during a 5-12 stretch which had cut the club's hold on the AL's best record to 1 1/2 games. However, the Royals (88-63) could finally be headed back in the right direction following a come-from-behind, walkoff victory. 
 
Jarrod Dyson hit a tying sacrifice fly in the ninth inning and Lorenzo Cain delivered an RBI single in the 10th to give Kansas City a 4-3 win Wednesday. 
 
""Champagne tomorrow, that would be nice,"" said Cain, who had three hits after entering in a 4-for-29 slump. 
 
The Royals could finally clinch their first division title since 1985 if they win Thursday's series finale while Minnesota loses to Cleveland. 
 
""We definitely know,"" first baseman Eric Hosmer said of the magic number being down to two. ""This kind of victory can give us a boost."" 
 
Cueto, acquired at the trade deadline to be the ace, hadn't helped with a 9.57 ERA during a five-start skid before allowing two runs over seven innings in Friday's 5-4, 12-inning loss at Detroit. 
 
Earlier last week, the 29-year-old met with manager Ned Yost and pitching coach Dave Eiland to discuss how to fix what had been giving him trouble. What they discovered was that catcher Salvador Perez needed to make the adjustment, not Cueto (2-6, 5.12 ERA). 
 
""He thought that with Salvy being so tall, he was setting up a high target,"" Yost told MLB's official website. ""Johnny is a guy who throws to the glove. So if the target is set up high, he's going to miss high."" 
 
Now it could be Drew Butera setting up low after Perez left Wednesday's game with a bruised knee. 
 
Cueto hasn't faced the Mariners since 2010 when he was with the Reds. Now he's taking on a Seattle team that has hit .303 and averaged 6.4 runs while going 8-2 on the road this month. 
 
Ketel Marte went 3 for 5 with his third home run Wednesday. He's batting .415 over a 10-game hitting streak for the Mariners, who fell to 13-7 in September. 
 
Robinson Cano singled to become the 14th player to reach 2,000 hits in his first 11 seasons. 
 
""I feel blessed,"" Cano said. ""Like I said, it doesn't mean too much because we were losing."" 
 
James Paxton (3-4, 3.70) will try to help Seattle (74-78) improve to 5-1 at Kansas City over the past two seasons. The left-hander is continuing to work through some wildness after missing more than three months due to a blister problem. 
 
After yielding three walks and three runs over three innings in a 3-2 loss to Colorado on Sept. 13, he overcame four free passes to give up one run over 4 1-3 in Friday's 3-1 win at Texas. 
 
In his only career start versus Kansas City, Paxton surrendered four hits while striking out a career-high 10 in seven innings of a 4-0 win in September 2",53b61f3c-3850-4ef1-90e2-489b8afe851a,News,2015-09-24T14:41:18Z,FOXNews.com,"With a little help, Cueto could deliver Royals first division title in 30 years",0.0,Blog

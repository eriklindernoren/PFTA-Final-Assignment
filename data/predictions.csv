Partnership Will Allow Viewers to Experience Original 360-Degree Content as well as Upload User Generated 360-Degree, Virtual Reality Content

PITTSBURGH 

DEFY plans to debut the platform on Break.com in early October in conjunction with 360fly's retail launch at Best Buy. The company will also look to launch the 360fly platform across other DEFY brand channels in the coming year, as well as leveraging 360fly digital products for its original studio production and programming. 

360fly's interactive 360-degree video player technology provides viewers a 360 x 240-degree field of view. Viewers can literally immerse themselves within the video through touch-screen technology, clicking, dragging or swiping on any mobile device, as well as through motion-sensor technology by which the movement of the device itself controls the interactive experience of the video. With desktops and laptops, this interactivity is achieved through the use of the mouse, clicking and dragging the video to see and experience different vantage points within the larger 360 x 240-degree field of view. ""The introduction of interactive 360-degree video is truly a game-changer, opening the door to an entirely new universe of innovative interactive and virtual reality content experiences for our viewers and internal content creators,"" said Keith Richman 

The collaboration is a valuable one for 360fly as it pushes forward in its mission to drive widespread mainstream acceptance, production and consumption of interactive 360-degree video, while also democratizing virtual reality through a platform that's dramatically more accessible and feasible for mainstream consumers. To date, consumption of virtual reality has been a very costly proposition, requiring the use of much higher-priced equipment and limited to a small array of virtual reality content. In combination with affordable cardboard virtual reality goggles, 360fly is opening the door for consumers to produce, consume and share virtual reality experiences at a moment's notice. 

""Affordable cameras and viewing devices are only part of the equation. The final piece is consumers having access to a robust ecosystem of destinations where they can readily consume a wide range of 360-degree virtual reality content,"" said Peter Adderton

1905,"Is that a mirage or really a yoga studio at Dallas Fort Worth Airport Terminal?! Call me crazy, my husband already thinks so, how giddy with joy I was when I saw the yoga area at DFW (airport code listed to impress you, dear husband ). After a sitting on a plane and emerging with stiffness and aches of pains this is a place where I can decompress and take care of “ME” in between flights. You guys can take the fancy lounges, this is my happy place. The studio is located between the B and D terminals, in a walkway near gate D40.  DFW is a really big airport, so you may need to take the train or ask one of the info volunteers for directions on how to find your way there. Once there, only a partition separates you from the stressful hustle and bustle of air travel and enjoying a moment enjoying a peaceful Savasana. It’s not the most private relaxation area I’ve ever done yoga in, but the hallway was pretty empty.  This fully equipped studio (not that you need much for yoga) includes mats and hand sanitizer. You do need to bring your you own yoga pants.  Better yet, just wear them on the plane so your comfortable.  There was nobody in the studio when I showed up, so I had it all to myself. There was a television that seemed to play videos on a continuous loop.  The picture quality was pretty bad and the video was definitely a bit, well, dated.  A better choice here is to bring your own app. Sworkit, which I reviewed last week, includes a yoga option of sun salutations, basic stretches or you can create your own on your flight so it’s ready when you land.  I’ll also be reviewing another app focused solely on Yoga shortly. DFW isn’t the only airport with yoga.  You can see pictures and descriptions of yoga areas in Chicago O’Hare, Burlington VT, San Francisco and Helsinki in this article. I also found yoga areas at Albuquerque International Sunport and Raleigh-Durham International Airport.

You probably heard some of the amazing claims about a series of four “blood moons” and what this could mean relative to Bible prophecy. Well, number four just took place (September 27 or 28, depending on where you live) and nothing happened! That’s right. Nothing. 
 
John Hagee (author of “Four Blood Moons”) has been promoting a theory that God is sending signs in the skies that may precede the second coming of Jesus. Hagee says we are the last generation, and that God is sending signs to indicate that “…we’re going to see something dramatic happen in the Middle East involving Israel that will change the course of history in the Middle East and impact the whole world.” 
 
Well, four blood moons have come and gone and nothing happened. 
 
What is a blood moon? it is a total eclipse of the moon–a lunar eclipse, where the earth blocks the direct light of the sun from reaching the moon. The moon sits in the earth’s shadow. During a total lunar eclipse the moon appears red because indirect light from the sun passing through the earth’s atmosphere takes on a red hue and illuminates the moon. There is no blood on the moon. 
 
Blood moons are not rare at all. We get two of them every year. They often fall on Jewish holidays because of the way the Jewish calendar works. Sometimes it happens that four consecutive eclipses fall on Jewish holidays. And that’s what all the hype is about. When that happens, eclipses in the spring occur on Passover; the fall eclipses occur on the Feast of Tabernacles. That’s it. 
 
Are blood moons related to Bible prophecy. Not at all. Though that is what Hagee and others claim. Hagee says that every time four blood moons fall on Jewish holidays, something significant happens. But the historical record will not vindicate that claim. 
 
What about Bible passages that speak of “the moon being turned into blood”? Don’t those texts indicate something significant connected with the blood moons? No. The three texts ( Joel 2:28-32 , Acts 2:16-2 1 Revelation 6:12-13 ) have to do with judgments of God against sin. Those judgments took place long ago. 
 
Those texts were not about lunar eclipses, but were about the darkness associated with judgments of God. For more on this kind of highly dramatic figurative language, read Isaiah 13:1-10 and Ezekiel 32:1-11 . Those texts speak of God’s judgments on Babylon and Egypt. Those, too, have already taken place. 
 
A FINAL WORD 
 
Folks often ask me, “What about signs that tell us when Jesus is coming back?” 
 
Sorry, there are no such signs in the Bible. Jesus said this in Matthew 24:36 … 
 
“But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone.” 
 
Note that Jesus said that even He did not know. Hagee doesn’t know. John Hagee is a false teacher. You and I don’t know when Jesus will return. Just be ready.

496,"WASHINGTON (CNN) – A day after the Senate secured President Barack Obama’s Iran nuclear deal, blocking a Republican resolution to scuttle it, the GOP-led House pressed forward with a pair of votes designed to show a majority of the chamber disapproves of the agreement. 

The votes can’t prevent the administration from starting to implement the agreement later this month, but Republicans want to send a political message. 

A bill approving of the nuclear deal was resoundingly defeated, with 25 Democrats joining House Republicans in expressing opposition to the pact. One Republican, Kentucky Rep. Tom Massie, voted “present.” 

On a second vote largely along party lines, the House passed legislation stating that the President could not unilaterally lift statutory sanctions. The measure was non-binding, and Senate Republicans have no plans to advance the bill. The vote was 247 to 186, with two Democrats voting with Republicans. 

Paving the way for a possible legal challenge, the House passed a non-binding resolution on Thursday stating that the President violated the law by not giving Congress the details on “side deals” to the nuclear agreement related to inspections of Iranian sites, which are government by secret arrangements between Tehran and the U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency.",5cb30f91-4010-49cb-946d-ef7d59343341,News,2015-09-11T17:07:32Z,WGOW 1150 AM,House rejects Iran nuclear deal,0.0,News

Hong Kong (CNN) Typhoon Dujuan walloped Taiwan with howling winds and sheets of rain, killing at least two people and injuring more than 300 before heading on to mainland China. 

The powerful storm made landfall late Monday on Taiwan's east coast, pummeling the town of Suao with gusts as strong as 246 kph (153 mph).

4156,"With more than 40 Democrats lined up to support Barack Obama over the Iran nuclear deal, the outcome of a fiery Senate debate on the matter may look a foregone conclusion, but the manner in which it is resolved could yet have important bearing on the president’s ability to make the deal stick. What looks like an arcane row between Republicans and Democrats over process is instead a battle over how much political responsibility for the deal its supporters are prepared to assume and, perhaps, whether a future Republican White House would dare to seek to unpick it. It is a big day for the Senate. Majority leader Mitch McConnell has even requested that all 100 members be physically present in the chamber during the debate in order to hear what everyone has to say. For the vast majority of Americans, who perhaps occasionally catch glimpses of their lawmakers passionately holding forth in television close-ups on C-Span, it may come as a surprise to learn that this is a highly unusual development.
The self-styled “world’s greatest deliberative body” is often entirely empty; save for a lone speaker recording his or her thoughts on a given subject solely for the stenographers and unblinking lens of the TV camera.
The Senate’s ambiguous voting rules are also under scrutiny like never before thanks to a bitter row between Democrats and Republicans over exactly how many legislators are required to pass a law.
In theory, a simple majority of the 100 senators should be enough to pass a piece of legislation, such as the motion of disapproval in the Iran nuclear deal. This may even just mean 50 senators, since vice-president Joe Biden can cast a deciding vote in the event of a deadlock.
If a similar majority is achieved in the 435-seat House of Representatives, then the bill goes to the desk of the president, who can either choose to sign it into law or exercise his veto.
But in practice, a super-majority of 60 votes has long been seen as the threshold for most legislation. The reason is that in order for a vote to proceed, debate must first be brought to a close with a so-called “cloture” motion – a procedural hurdle that requires three-fifths of the Senate to approve.
Since refusal to pass cloture allows an infinite period of debate to frustrate the passage of legislation, it is sometimes referred to as a “filibuster” – although it is rare that this involves senators physically holding the floor for hours by speaking and more usually is simply a refusal of one side to allow the necessary procedural steps toward a vote to take place.
In the case of the Iran bill, Democrats argue that the need for a super-majority was implicit in an agreement they reached in April with Republicans over how they would review the nuclear deal. Democratic minority leader Harry Reid offered on Tuesday to skip the remaining procedural steps and move directly to a vote, providing – and this is an important catch – that the Republicans agree that it have a 60-vote threshold.
If this were to happen, Republicans would almost certainly lose the vote. After Maria Cantwell of Washington became the last to express an opinion on Tuesday night, some 42 of the 46 Democrats (including two independents who normally vote with them) have now said they are in favour of the Iran deal.
Many have said so reluctantly, however, fearful that the terms of the deal do not do enough to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons technology, and Republicans are nonetheless determined to extract maximum discomfort from the situation.
By insisting that normal rules are followed, Republican majority leader McConnell hopes to test whether these Democrats are not just willing to support the Iran deal but also be seen to use filibuster blocking tactics to prevent a vote from taking place at all.
At least one of the 42 – Delaware senator Chris Coons – has indicated he would be uncomfortable in doing this. If one more Democrat were to join him and vote in favour of cloture, then it is possible that Republicans still have enough support to end the debate, vote on the bill and pass the vote of disapproval of the Iran deal by a simple majority.
From the outside, it can be hard to see why any of this matters. Obama has pledged to veto anything emerging from Congress that blocks the deal, insisting it is a presidential prerogative to conduct US foreign policy and refusing to treat the Iran deal as a formal treaty – something that would require express congressional ratification.
Congress could override this veto, but only with a two-thirds majority in both the House and the Senate, so the short term survival of the Iran deal was assured as soon as the Democrats secured the support of 34 senators. But the way in which this end game plays out does matter – at least for US domestic politics, and possibly, ultimately, its foreign policy too. Many Republicans want Democrats – including presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton, who speaks in favour of the Iran deal on Wednesday morning – to “own” what they believe to be a deeply unpopular policy.
Forcing Democratic senators to spell out their support in a formal vote is therefore some scant consolation to the deal’s critics, who are otherwise running out of options to frustrate the process directly.
Even better, at least from the perspective of some Republicans, would be the sight of Democrats being forced to use filibuster tactics to block Congress from expressing its majority view.
Few Democrats see it that way, of course, and many say this is always the way the Senate works.
Nevertheless, the battle to seize the moral high ground that will play out this week matters in the long run, particularly if a Republican president is elected in 2016.
As the deal’s opponents point out, most dramatically in a letter to the Ayatollah of Iran, executive actions are not binding on future presidents, who may choose to walk away from the deal after 2016.
Whether this would have any impact on the international coalition behind the sanctions is a separate question, but it would be much easier for a future Republican president to justify reversing US policy if he or she can point to a vote of disapproval by the last Congress.",4551c1b5-93fe-4dff-b71d-523e53c1193e,Blog,2015-09-09T13:16:06Z,World news | The Guardian,Iran deal reaches Congress: what happens next and why it matters,1.0,Blog
2816,"The latest on Royal Dutch Shell ending exploratory oil drilling in the Arctic Ocean (all times local):

11:20 a.m.

Alaska's senior senator is calling on the Obama administration to work with Alaskans to develop a clear path for drilling in the Arctic.

Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski urges the administration to developing a legitimate, predictable and sensible regulatory system that will encourage oil companies to invest in Alaska, both onshore and off.

She made the statement Monday on the heels of Shell saying it will cease Arctic operations, in part due to unpredictable federal regulations.

Alaska's junior senator, Republican Dan Sullivan, said environmental groups are cheering the news, but he says it's a sad day for Alaska and working Americans.

Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley countered it's tremendous news, and a credit to the people who made clear that Arctic drilling in unacceptable.

The Democrat says the U.S. should ""seize the moment"" and use its chairmanship of the Arctic Council to develop and agreement to end offshore drill among all Arctic nations.

---

10:25 a.m.

The president of the Alaska Native regional corporation for Iñupiat living on the Arctic Slope said the news that Royal Dutch Shell is ceasing exploratory drilling in the Arctic is a major blow for Alaska.

Rex A. Rock Sr. with the Arctic Slope Regional Corp. says the timing is bad as Alaska is facing a ""financial crisis"" because of low oil prices and dwindling production from Prudhoe Bay.

Rock says it also hits close to home to for communities dependent upon oil production.

Without resource development both on- and off-shore, he says they are facing ""a fiscal crisis beyond measure.""

Shell also cited ""the challenging and unpredictable federal regulatory environment"" in deciding to end drilling in the Alaska Arctic for the foreseeable future.

Rock says that regulatory environment has proven to be a burden to development. He adds it will lead to more good opportunities slipping away because ""no one wants to do business in Alaska.""

---

Alaska Gov. Bill Walker says Royal Dutch Shell's decision to stop exploratory drilling in the Arctic shows the state needs to drive its own destiny through oil and gas development.

Shell said Monday that it was ending operations in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska after a test well gave disappointing results. The company has spent $7 billion on its Alaska drilling program.

Walker says he's contacted the White House to set up meetings about the impact of Shell's decision on the state. The governor also says he will stress the importance of the federal government allowing oil and gas drilling along the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

Alaska's budget relies heavily on oil revenue, but production from the once-prodigious North Slope now barely fills a quarter of the trans-Alaska pipeline.",17f04bf0-320f-4c6d-8f7c-01dc07db12d0,News,2015-09-28T19:34:07Z,Modesto Bee,The Latest Murkowski calls for clear path to drilling,0.0,News
1892,"The Niners this morning announced they have waived 10 players and, as expected, the Australian superstar is not among them.

It means Hayne, who is firming as a starter in the punt return position, needs only to get through one more cut this Sunday (AEST).

The 49ers roster currently stands at 75 and must be trimmed to 53 by 1p.m. on Saturday here in California.

Hayne jersey available ‘off the rack’

The Daily Telegraph this morning purchased a Hayne #38 jersey — for the bargain price of US$99.95 before tax — from the club’s main retail outlet at Levi’s Stadium.

Until now, the only way fans could buy a Hayne jersey was to go online, or into stores, and have one specifically made to order.

HAYNE HUB: MORE JARRYD HAYNE NEWS 

Indeed, only last week it was suggested neither Nike or the 49ers would put Hayne merchandise ‘on the rack’ until the 27-year-old superstar had made the 53-man roster.

Yet so staggering is the desire for gear bearing the name of the Australian cult figure, the 49ers have this week taken the extraordinary step of putting a range in their stores prior to the final pre-season game against San Diego.

Indeed, in the few minutes it took us to take pictures of the #38 jersey on sale, a staffer came and grabbed two off the rack to put on hold behind the counter.

Asked about the demand, she said: “Oh, this guy sure is hot. Source: Supplied “Every time I pick up the phone people are saying ‘Have you got Hayne, have you got Hayne?’.

“It’s crazy.”

Online, the 49ers price for a customised Hayne jersey remains US$99.95. However to have one made here at Levi’s Stadium costs US$149.95.

However, with interest in the Aussie now teetering on chaotic, and the franchise playing San Diego at home Thursday, club officials have decided to try and help meet the demand.

A store manager said he was unable to say exactly how many Hayne jerseys had been made available in-store or whether more would be produced prior to the Chargers game.

However, The Daily Telegraph understands the current batch were only put out over the weekend, when the team was playing the Denver Broncos at Mile High Stadium.

Certainly, the decision to sit Hayne’s jersey beside that of Kaepernick — in the official team store, no less — is staggering when you consider the Sydneysider is yet to be guaranteed a contract. Source: Supplied Currently, the traditional red and white home jerseys are the only ones for sale at Levi’s Stadium. However, should Hayne make the cut Nike are ready to mass produce a variety of jerseys with his name and number.

They will also consider other ‘accessories’ such as caps and T-shirts.

The find comes only a day after 49ers coach Jim Tomsula said he had already “seen what I need to see” in terms of Hayne as a punt returner.",c19d0d6c-5949-4275-ab2d-e01ce1529833,News,2015-09-01T00:47:00Z,NEWS.com.au,Hayne hits the shelves after surviving first cut,0.0,News

166,"Expected change in U.S. healthcare industry will have a positive rub off on Indian outsourcing sector s the United States gears up to implement the ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases) coding system from October 1, Omega Healthcare,  an offshore provider of medical revenue cycle services, said this would open up large scale employment opportunities for medical coders, especially in India. “ObamaCare and ICD-10 implementation open up vast opportunities for us as the demand for certified medical coders will go up sharply,” said Gopi Natarajan, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder, Omega Healthcare. “The market is hot. Both ObamaCare and migration to the ICD-10 new coding system provides an opportunity which is equal to the Y2K shift, a decade and half ago,” Mr. Natarajan said. Complying with the new regulation, for accurate identification of diseases and reimbursement of health insurance claims to healthcare service providers, will be difficult as the number of codes will go up from 16,000 as per ICD-9 to 1,25,000 codes in ICD-10. As per World Health Organisation, each disease has been assigned with a code based on which service providers get paid. This would require high level of specificity to identify the actual disease or ailment suffered or treated. It calls for very detailed documentation to establish the code and only experienced coders - life science graduates with the adequate training - can help in assigning the code leading to accurate billing. It is believed that the implementation of ICD-10 will change the healthcare industry in United States and the outsourcing industry across the globe and the transition will create huge demand for certified medical coders across the globe, especially in the U.S., Middle East and in India. “We are fully prepared for the change. We already have 2,500 coders from our 9,000 employee base and we will be hiring more people in the coming months,” Mr. Natarajan said. “Ninety seven per cent of our 2,500 coders have been retrained for the transaction. They have undergone 40 hours of training. We project a huge demand for trained coders in the coming months,” he said. Omega Healthcare is on an expansion mode and plans to hire more than 1,000 people by January. While 300 people will be added at its facility at Chennai, 450 people will be hired at Tiruchi and 250 people at Bengaluru. Last year, the company opened a facility at Manila in Philippines where it has employed 400 people and this facility has capacity to accommodate 650 personnel, mainly nurses who take patients’ calls. In three years Omega Healthcare plans to have 13,000 people as the market has potential for growth.     Mr. Natarajan said the company would invest $8 million to $10 million a year from internal accruals to expand capacity to cater to the growing demand for outsourced medical services from the U.S. Medical coding and billing is considered very crucial in the healthcare industry but the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) industry which provides these services is facing deficit of talent in the sector.",721f89d2-6400-4837-8dd5-1c4b0ddac8ae,Blog,2015-09-26T14:20:42Z,Trichy on Move,Omega Healthcare eyes more biz and to hire 450 people,1.0,Blog

2429,"CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Cleveland police and Cuyahoga County prosecutors have started using wiretaps in some criminal investigations, taking a page from the playbook of the U.S. Justice Department. 
 
The move is in part a result of local investigators seeing the results the Justice Department obtained with wiretaps in high-profile cases, said Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Matthew Meyer. 
 
""We've seen the technique used with great success locally in rooting out corruption and there's no reason why we should leave that tool on the shelf,"" Meyer said in an interview with Northeast Ohio Media Group. 
 
Secretly recorded phone conversations figured prominently in the Justice Department's investigation of corruption in Cuyahoga County. The investigation resulted in convictions of some 60 contractors and public officials, including former County Commissioner Jimmy Dimora. 
 
This summer, county prosecutors acknowledged in court that local investigators used wiretaps in two high-profile cases, both handled by Meyer. 
 
One case involves suspected mobster Carmine ""The Bull"" Agnello , who is charged with running a $4.2 million car-scrapping scheme. The second involves Tevaughn ""Big Baby"" Darling, accused of being a ""heroin kingpin.""   
 
Why wiretaps haven't been used before 
 
County Prosecutor Timothy J. McGinty, who has spent more than three decades in the county's criminal justice system as either a prosecutor or judge, said he's not aware of the prosecutor's office ever before using a wiretap without help from federal agents. 
 
McGinty said he suspects time and money are the reasons previous prosecutors did not seek permission from a judge to use the listening devices. 
 
The equipment costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, he said, and officers have to be trained to use the equipment. 
 
Mostly, though, the use of wiretaps is time-consuming. Officers often have to be committed to spending hundreds or even thousands of hours listening in on phone conversations, many of which are irrelevant to the investigation. 
 
McGinty credited the Cleveland police department with initiating the local use of wiretaps and getting the process up and running, along with financial assistance and training from Attorney General Mike DeWine's office. 
 
A spokeswoman for the police department declined to comment, citing a need for secrecy because wiretaps involve ""investigative strategy."" 
 
McGinty said wiretaps are worth the investment of time and money. 
 
""When you have sophisticated, diabolical, and dangerous criminals such as the ones we've targeted and others, we want to use all the tools at our disposal, and this is a powerful tool,"" he said.  
 
Defense lawyers take notice 
 
Defense attorney Marcus Sidoti, who faces wiretap evidence in representing the accused ""heroin kingpin,"" could not recall an earlier case in which county prosecutors used wiretaps without assistance from federal agents. 
 
""It's uncharted territory for me in the state realm,"" he said.  
 
And Ian Friedman, an adjunct faculty member at the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law and the defense attorney representing Agnello, called the use of wiretaps in his client's case ""very unusual."" 
 
But now that the prosecutor's office has shown its hand, Friedman said defense attorneys will be better prepared for wiretap evidence. 
 
Friedman said he has always advised clients to be wary of what they discuss over the phone. Now, he said, he's pointing to the Agnello case to show that the state has invested in the technology, and is expected to use it frequently.  
 
""It's my understanding that there are hundreds of hours of recordings in the Agnello case alone, so it looks like this is going to be a new area of fight between prosecutors and defense lawyers in Cuyahoga County,"" Friedman said. 
 
Friedman and Sidoti have yet to hear the contents of the wiretaps used in their cases, but they said they will need to make sure the wiretaps were obtained legally and that the recorded conversations are admissible at trial.  
 
Prosecutors and police need permission from a judge to conduct a wiretap. To get that permission, they have to show they have probable cause that criminal activity is taking place, and that other investigative means haven't worked. 
 
Future uses 
 
McGinty said he intends to reserve the use of wiretaps for criminals who are the ""worst of the worst."" 
 
""In the long run, if we're successful...at using these wiretaps in our efforts to attack organized crime in Cleveland, whether it be Mafia, drug dealers or gang activity, this will be a safer place,"" he said. 
 
He said wiretaps are particularly useful in understanding all the players in a criminal network and how they operate. 
 
He also hopes the use of wiretaps by local investigators will have a deterrent effect. 
 
""We're sending a message,"" he said. ""To the criminals: We're coming to get you. This is not the county to operate in. Go get a job.""",ad64b2c0-205a-4b5d-90cc-a6d84891f085,News,2015-09-29T11:24:33Z,Cleveland.com,"Local investigators, prosecutors using wiretaps",0.0,News

2422,"THOUSANDS of Young people are flocking to Preston this week as the new university year gets underway.

Among the freshers at the University of Central Lancashire are more than 600 overseas students from over 120 different countries.

As Welcome Week - as Freshers is now known, the new international students from countries including China, Lithuania, the USA, Oman and Poland, received a warm welcome with a host of activities designed to introduce them to British culture. 

This included walking and cycling tours around the city, 10 - pin bowling and a traditional afternoon tea.

Pauline Kirijanovaite, a 20-year-old student from the Lithuanian Academy for Theatre and Music, will spend a semester at UCLan. 

She said: “So far I have loved everything about UCLan and Preston. 

“I want to make the most of my time here, both in regard to my studies and through meeting new people and travelling to new places.”

Sheryas Dhavileswanapu is from Dubai and about to start a three-year degree in games design.

He said: “I’ve been to the UK before but never to the North of England so it’s something completely new and exciting. I’m really looking forward to getting started.” 

Besides an introduction to the social welcome activities, the international students have been provided with access to a buddy to help them settle in.

The buddies are either a current student or recent graduate who is multi-lingual and knows the university and Preston very well.",d6387afa-50ec-4c62-830b-5632e8121468,News,2015-09-15T10:10:50Z,Lancashire Evening Post,Students arrive from  overseas,0.0,News

1002,"Two weeks into a three-week break, New Zealand golfer Lydia Ko is refreshed and ready to tackle the five-tournament Asian swing of the LPGA Tour. 

The world No.2, who sits fractionally behind top-ranked South Korean Inbee Park, has been enjoying some hard-earned time off after winning her first major title at the Evian Championship earlier this month. 

The 18-year-old returned to her Orlando, Florida, base for a little down time but told lpga.com she wasn't expecting to take too much of a break. 

""I don't really like to do a lot of physical things outside the golf course, and just lying in bed watching movies is good enough for me,"" she said. 

""Now I just kind of need to go back to square one, do my basic practices and work my way towards the Asia Swing."" 

Ko fashioned back-to-back wins in her last two starts, taking out the Canadian Open in August before wrapping the Evian Championship a month later. 

And although she's enjoying a break from the Tour, Ko says she's also aware that the first tournament of the Asia Swing begins in Kuala Lumpur on October 8. 

""I'm pretty sure it's going to be a great couple weeks in Asia. I kind of have to think of this in the back of my mind, enjoy it, but also prepare for what's coming up next."" 

It's been seven months since Park seized the world No.1 ranking off Ko, but the pair are now the closest they've been since February. 

Park sits on 12.94 ranking points to Ko's 12.82, well clear of their nearest rival, American Stacy Lewis. 

Ko and Park are almost neck and neck in every department with seven tournaments remaining in 2015 - not just the world rankings but also prize money earnings this year, along with LPGA's lucrative points race. 

The season concludes in late November at the Tour Championship in Florida, which Ko won last year to see off Park for money, points and top dog status.

856,"Ultimate triathlon  extravaganza set for Hever Castle Triathlon  
It is the final flagship race of the Castle  Triathlon Series and a
jam-packed, televised weekend with competitors of all  ages and abilities
signed up to take part in one of the biggest multisport  events in the UK.
Triathlon returns for the seventh annual Hever Castle
Triathlon weekend over the 26th and 27th September, ready  to write
another historic chapter at the former home of King Henry VIII. 
 
Fittingly for its seventh edition, the number  seven features prominently
throughout the event – starting with a record breaking  number of
entries currently standing at 7,000. The youngest competitor lining  up in
the world's biggest kids race is seven, whilst the oldest competitor is 77. 
 

 
The stunning venue, located in the heart of Kent,  welcomes competitors
from across the UK and internationally in a series of  distances and
challenges (including the biggest children's triathlon in the  world). Its
position at the end of the busy triathlon calendar and the final  stop on
the Castle Triathlon Series means that there is a party-like festival
atmosphere as triathletes sign off their season with PB's, new distances
achieved or sporting success shared with their friends of families. The
atmosphere is boosted by 500 camping through the weekend and lots of
entertainment including bands, climbing walls, archery, trade stands, fun
fair  and pleasure rides. 
 
The event attracts some of the best triathletes in  Britain who are set
to race hard and fast for their share of the trophies and  prize money. Up
for grabs this year is a prize fund of £8,000 that stands at
£2,000  for the Standard Distance race, whilst those triumphing in the
toughest  challenge of the day, the half-iron Gauntlet race, will also take
home their  share of £2,000. Further prizes are given for Series
winners. 
 Favourites  for The Gauntlet 2015 titles  
The Gauntlet at Hever Castle is the biggest test in  the Castle Triathlon
Series. The half-iron distance triathlon takes competitors  into the rolling
hills of the Kent Weald and through an ‘area of outstanding  beauty'.
Triathletes who took on the 1.9km swim, 90km bike and 21km run last  year
unequivocally reviewed it as one of the ‘must-do' events in the UK and
attracted  to the challenge, the field has grown once again this year from
200 in 2013 to  now over 850 – making it one of the most popular in
the country. 
 
Spearheading the men's field will be the intriguing  re-match between
Darren Jenkins (Bastion 2015 champion) and Karl Alexander  (Hever Castle
Gauntlet 2013 champion). These two had an awesome battle at Hever  Castle
earlier this year over the iron-distance Bastion Triathlon in July, with
Jenkins emerging on top with his fearsome run proving the decisive factor.
Now set  to battle it out again over the middle distance, will Jenkins once
again have  the upper hand, or will the shorter distance suit Alexander who
will have less  run course to cover before the finish line comes? These
questions and more will  all be answered over the race. 
 
Jenkins and Alexander won't have it all their own  way as there is talent
throughout the field, not least in the form of XTERRA  professional Matt
Dewis, Irish Middle Distance champion Kevin Thornton and  talented racer
Will Cowan – who can all challenge for the podium and have the  class
to win. 
 
British and Scottish Middle Distance Champion Nikki  Bartlett is in the
field and is the clear favourite for the women's title at  Hever Castle
Gauntlet Triathlon. 
 
Also in the field is Pete Dyson, Andy Dyson, Max  Hazell, Ben Matthews,
Colin Norris, Ben Pritchard and Neil Tandy. The women's  race will feature
Bex Milnes and Kim Morrison. 
 Olympic  distance speedsters  
Whilst the Gauntlet represents a test of speed over  distance at Hever
Castle Triathlon, the speed kings and queens will take on the  Olympic
distance triathlon, which comprises of the shorter (but no less  testing),
distances of 1.5km swim, 40km bike and 10km run. Competing for these  titles
will be elite athletes including Liam Lloyd, Phil Edgley, James Fearn,
Calum Johnson, William Kirk and Scott Thompson. 
 
The women's race looks particularly exciting, with Catherine  Jameson
headlining the field. Jameson is a fearsome competitor on the Castle
Triathlon Series circuit and has picked up wins at Chateau du Chantilly,
Castle  Howard and Cholmondeley already this year. Jameson is such a fan of
the Hever  Castle Triathlon that she has published her top ten reasons to do
the race HERE . 
 
Hever Castle would complete the set. However, a  challenge will come from
another former Hever Castle Champion, Vicky Johnston  and also from the
reigning European Aquathlon Champion Hannah Kitchen. 
 Hever Castle  – the ‘must-do British
race'  
In just six years the Hever Castle Triathlon has  swiftly established
itself as an essential destination for British and  international
triathletes, garnering plaudits and mainstream media attention  for its
picture postcard venue, elite action, age-group choice and festival
atmosphere.  There are no fewer than 14  race choices on offer making it one
of the biggest events in the UK. 
 
To cement the race's title as the world's largest  children's triathlon,
over 1,600 junior athletes are expected to take part. 
 
The races will begin with an amended and unique  open-water swim in the
spectacular 38 acre Hever Castle Lake and River Eden.  This creates an
incredible spectacle that is  rewarding for both the athletes and the
spectators who can see one of the most  exciting parts of the race up-close.
Competitors in The Gauntlet will take on a  single 1.9km lap whilst those
racing in the Olympic distance will take on (for  the first time), a single
1.5km lap. 
 

 
Those taking part will then transition onto the  undulating cycle that
takes athletes around a 20km circuit through the High  Weald of Kent, an
Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, with one lap for the  Sprint and two
laps for the Olympic-distance racers. Those on The Gauntlet will  be on a
specially designed two-lap course. The largely off-road run  circumnavigates
the estate and award-winning castle grounds before making the  dash to the
tree-lined finishing chute beside the lake. 
  Fun for  spectators too  
This year there is even more planned for friends,  family and all the
supporters at the Hever Castle Triathlon Triathlon, with a  variety of live
music, family games and of course a brilliant atmosphere for  all.  Relax in
the grounds of one of the  most famous castles in England and enjoy the
action unfold!

Mr Dutton was on Friday caught out joking about the plight of Pacific island nations facing rising seas from climate change. 
 
Noting that a meeting in Canberra was running a bit late, Mr Dutton quipped that it was running to ""Cape York time"", to which Prime Minister Tony Abbott replied: ""We had a bit of that up in Port Moresby."" 
 
Mr Dutton then said: ""Time doesn't mean anything when you're about to have water lapping at your door.""

5368,"The snack aisle at your local supermarket may look a lot healthier in five years. (Ben Schumin) Perhaps the introduction of the so-called healthier, more adult-focused Thin Oreos earlier this year was a sign that Mondelez, the maker behind the cookies and a plethora of other snacks, was on the fast track to being a health-conscious brand. The company vowed today to revamp its offering so that in five years 50% of its revenue comes from healthy snacks. Executive vice president and chief growth officer Mark Clouse says in the release that the company currently records just one-third of its sales from healthy snacks. “We intend to become the global leader in well-being snacks,” he says in a statement. “Our goal is to simplify and enhance the ingredient and nutritional profile of our base business while also focusing on breakthrough innovation to address consumers’ well-being needs.” To achieve the new health-focused goal, Clouse says the company will dedicate 70% of new product development efforts on “well-being platforms.” Those efforts will likely include more individually wrapped snacks that are 200 calories or less and products that have nutritional attributes, such as fewer ingredients and no artificial flavors, Reuters reports. “If you look at where consumers are going, we have to better position the portfolio to fully unlock the potential for growth,” Clouse said. In addition to turning toward more healthy fare, Mondelez reaffirmed on Thursday its commitment to increasing revenue of organic products by 3% this year.

3887,"KANSAS CITY, MO (KCTV) - 

Dozens of people are sending positive vibes across the country as a little boy fights a big battle.

Isaac Velasquez, 3, has a rare condition that causes blood vessel inflammation.

Monday night, supporters gathered to send positive wishes to young Issac.

They sang, they talked, and they prayed-all for a precious three-year-old little boy in a hospital bed more than 1,400 miles away.

""It pulls at your heart to see him struggle like this but he is a fighter,"" said family friend Ashley Bradley

Isaac was diagnosed with a rare disease that's affecting his circulation, threatening to shut down major organs.

It started on August 30 when Isaac woke up vomiting.

His family thought it was the flu. It wasn't, and within days, the toddler was in Boston.

Isaac's mother's best friend set up a Facebook page so people could send wishes and prayers to the family As of Monday night, that page has been shared more than 11,000 times.

""We just keep getting all these great reports that he's doing better than expected and we're just praising God and giving him the glory,"" said Kim Johnson, Isaac's grandmother.

Candles of hope lit up the sanctuary as Isaac's parents watched on FaceTime in Boston.

It could be weeks before Isaac is back home in Kansas City. But, Monday night, a lot of people are counting the days.

651,"NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Pandora    is proving to be quite resilient. 
 
Shares of the Oakland-based customized-radio company were spiking Monday on a decision by the U.S. Copyright Office that's expected to favor a payment regimen supported by the music streaming service over those of musician associations. Shares rose as much as 15% on Monday before leveling at $20.72,  a gain of 5.2%. 
 
Pandora shares have been on a roller coaster ride for much of the past year amid speculation that the U.S. Copyright Royalty Board would rule in favor of music publishers and songwriters over the streaming service, and that Apple 's Music app would ultimately inexorably weaken the company.  
 
Neither has yet occurred. 
 
In an e-mailed statement, Netflix  said that the U.S. Copyright Royalty Board would support Pandora's request to use the so-called Merlin/Naxos agreements as benchmarks in its final rate decision. The decision bolsters Pandora's business model of which royalty fees comprise about 50%. To pay higher fees, Pandora had argued, would jeopardize the company's ability to remain solvent. 
 
""We are pleased that the Copyright Office affirmed the admissibility of Pandora's agreement with Merlin as a valid benchmark in the Copyright Royalty Board proceedings,"" the statement said. ""We look forward to the certainty that December's decision will bring, and are prepared to thrive in a number of potential outcomes. Our investments in the business are providing real return, including almost $1.5 billion in royalties to date."" 
 
A final decision is expected from the board on Dec. 16. Sound Exchange, an association that represents musicians on royalty issues, and had opposed Pandora in presentations before the royalty board, couldn't immediately be reached for comment. 
 
The royalty board's favorable preliminary decision comes as Pandora shares have actually gained 7.1% since Apple made public the details of its new Music app. Predictions of Pandora's decline as a result of Apple Music have thus far not materialized. That's due to a number of factors, the first being that Pandora's ad-supported service already had 79.2 million users at the end of March 31, a hefty customer base providing an ample head start. 
 
Secondly, Pandora's curated radio model appeals to listeners who may not want to be constantly selecting songs. The dueling apps are a battle between a lean-back vs. a lean-in style of music listening. 
 
And thirdly, Pandora has shown that the great bulk of its users are content to listen to ads rather than pay for subscriptions to avoid them. In effect, Pandora's biggest rival is terrestrial radio rather than services like Apple Music or Spotify .",5fdef550-6937-4c14-9618-1cb5a2d8c4ec,News,2015-09-21T15:54:00Z,Litchfield County Times,Pandora's Music Business Is Proving to Be Very Resilient,0.0,News

1676,"Bradbury boxer and father of two Davey Browne has died after being knocked out during a bout at Ingleburn RSL Club on Saturday night. Bradbury boxer and father of two Davey Browne has died after being knocked out during a bout at Ingleburn RSL Club on Saturday night. Fighting Filipino Carlo Magali for the IBF Pan Pacific Junior-Lightweight title, the 28-year-old was knocked out late in the last round.

Witnesses reportedly said Mr Browne regained consciousness momentarily and was placed on a stool in the corner but slipped off and back into unconsciousness.

He was taken to the Liverpool ospital and placed on life support but died in on Tuesday morning.

Local boxer and former world champion Daniel Geale said he knew Mr Browne well and the two had met while they were training at Grange Old School Boxing in Smeaton Grange.

He said the incident was devestating for Mr Browne, his family and the Macarthur and wider boxing community.

‘‘When I first heard the news, being a boxer myself it was pretty devestating,’’ he said.

‘‘The first thing my wife said to me was ‘are you going to stop boxing now?’ but that wasn’t on my mind.

‘‘But [incidents like these] do knock you for six a bit.

‘‘Davey has always been tall for his weight, a fast boxer and great on his feet.''

Tommy Mercuri, a trainer at West Side Boxing in Leppington, first encountered Mr Browne as a 12-year-old.

Mr Mercuri had been the hospital to visit the boxer he described as a ‘‘great kid and a great bloke’’.

‘‘He was a beautiful kid all over,’’ he said.

‘‘I trained Davey and his brother Tommy and their dad used to train out of the gym also.

‘‘I can’t say a bad word about any of them.

‘‘This is just a tragedy.’’

Earlier this month the Australian Medical Association — a long time opponent of boxing — called for those aged under 18 to be banned from combat sports.

It has also pushed for boxing to banned from the Commonwealth and Olympic games.

Association president Professor Brian Owler said combat sports were ‘‘inherently dangerous’’.

‘‘As medical practitioners, the AMA is concerned by any sports that involve displays of interpersonal violence, and where the goal is to injure the opponent to the point that they are unable to continue,’’ he said.

Mr Mercuri said while the dangers to boxers were not unique..

‘‘People rubbish boxing but it [and incident like this] can happen anywhere — look at Michael Schumacher, motor bike riders and footballers,’’ he said.

Mr Geale also called for calm.

‘‘I love the sport of boxing and everyone knows it’s dangerous ... but there are a lot of other sports where people get hurt in a bad way,’’ Mr Geale said.

It is believed Mr Browne was training out of the Out West Fight Club in Eagle Vale.",3e8bf5da-cb3f-4816-8fc8-914a8e22ee2c,News,2015-09-14T03:30:00Z,Wollondilly Advertiser,Tributes for deceased Macarthur boxer Davey Browne,0.0,News

Despite the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the construction market in Bahrain has managed to gain momentum. This can be attributed to the significant investment opportunities in several sectors such as restaurants, manufacturing, transport, construction, wholesale, and healthcare. The construction market in Bahrain can be categorized into four segments: transportation, energy and resources, industrial, and commercial. When the four sectors are evaluated individually, the transportation sector had the highest spending in 2014.

3421,"Denmark has placed advertisements in four Lebanese newspapers announcing tighter regulations and cuts in provisions for asylum-seekers. 
 
The advertisement published on Monday said that social assistance for newly arrived refugees was being reduced by up to 50 percent. 
 
Those granted temporary protection would not have the right to family reunification for the first year of their residence, the ad warned. 
 
New refugees will have to be able to speak and understand Danish in order to obtain a permanent residency.

“There will be a special return centre for rejected asylum-seekers to ensure (they)… leave Denmark as quickly as possible,” the advertisement added. 
 
The new measures went into effect on Tuesday. 
 
Lebanon hosts 1.1 million Syrians who have fled the four-year-long conflict that has devastated their homeland. 
 
Syrians are also the largest nationality among those trying to reach northern Europe via sea crossings to Greece followed by an arduous overland route through the Balkans and Hungary. 
 
Denmark’s Integration Minister Inger Stojberg shared the Arabic version of the advert on her Facebook page  
 
Most of the refugees and migrants are seeking to reach Germany and Sweden, which are known for their openness to asylum claims from Syrians. 
 
Almost half of the claims for asylum lodged by Syrians in European countries have been made in those two countries, with another third lodged in countries along the Balkan route or in the Netherlands, according to UN refugee agency UNHCR. 
 
A total of 348,540 Syrians had lodged asylum claims in Europe by July 2015, according to UNHCR, while more than 4 million are hosted in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt. 
 
Another 7.6 million Syrians are displaced internally, meaning that more than half the country’s pre-war population of 22.4 million has been driven from their homes by the conflict.

18,"The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department said it was a matter of public safety when deputies opened fire from a helicopter on a wrong-way chase suspect on the 215 Freeway. 
On Friday, a suspect led authorities on a dangerous high-speed chase through surface streets in Fontana and San Bernardino before he drove the wrong way in the northbound lanes of the freeway. He reached speeds as high as 100 mph and deputies deemed him a threat to public safety. 

Lt. Mitch Datillo said there is a lot for deputies to take into account before firing from a helicopter. 

""If you're near schools, if you're in residential areas. We have had times where we fully intended that it was getting to that level and we could not deploy, based on the backdrop and the public safety there,"" he said. 

But when the suspect jumped out of his SUV after being shot, the car continued to move and slammed head-on into another SUV, injuring three people. A relative of that family told Eyewitness News that he questions the decision by deputies to open fire from the air. 

While shooting from a helicopter is rare, it does happen. In 2004, a deputy with the Orange County Sheriff's Department opened fire from their helicopter on a suspect who was firing at deputies at a recycling plant near Irvine. 

Eyewitness News spoke with use-of-force expert and Inyo County Sheriff's Deputy Ed. Obayashi, who said he agrees with the decision to shoot, based partly on the fact of the suspect's speed while heading in the wrong direction on the freeway. 

""It could have been worse,"" he said. ""That constitutes an immediate grave danger to the public and that justifies deadly force."" 

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Special Enforcement Bureau is authorized and trains deputies to shoot from a helicopter. Ventura County sheriff's deputies are not trained, but after hearing about the deadly chase, officials said they may consider changing the policy and training deputies.",b7d890c6-ac0c-4df1-80ce-f5cfd885fd71,News,2015-09-22T06:27:24Z,LocalNews7.com,Sheriff's department says San...,0.0,News

821,"Fed watchers are speculating that the FOMC meeting later this month might be the occasion to raise the federal funds rate target off the ""zero lower bound,"" where it has been since December 2008.  In a column arguing against such a move, Larry Summers writes:
From the Depression to the Vietnam War to the Iraq war to the euro crisis, we surely should learn that policymakers who elevate credibility over responding to clear realities make grave errors. The best way the Fed can maintain and enhance its credibility is to support a fully employed American economy achieving its inflation target with stable financial conditions. The greatest damage it could do to its credibility would be to embrace central-banking shibboleth disconnected from current economic reality. At the Fiscal Times, Mark Thoma writes:
The inflation problems of the 1970s, the loss of Fed credibility that came with it, and the need to impose the Volcker recession in the early 1980s to bring inflation down to tolerable levels made an indelible impression on policymakers who lived through that time period. The Fed’s trigger-happy response to any suggestion of an inflation problem is directly related to the desire to never let such an inflation outburst happen again.
But it has been more than four decades since the beginning of the inflation problems of the 1970s, and the economic environment in which monetary policy operates has changed considerably since that time. Those changes support patience, particularly in response to increases in wages, wages that have been stagnant since the 1970s even as labor productivity has been increasing. The ""credibility"" argument in monetary policy is based on the idea that the central bank will be tempted to use inflation to ""overheat"" the economy and bring unemployment down below its ""natural"" (or equilibrium) levels for political reasons - e.g., to help the incumbent party in an election year.  Any gains would be, at best, short-lived, as people would incorporate a higher level of inflation into their expectations and set wages and prices accordingly.  Based on this logic - which seems helpful for interpreting how we got into the ""stagflation"" of the 1970s - economists look for policies and institutional structures to correct this perceived inflationary bias.
In the past several years, this logic seems turned on its head.  If anything, the biases of our monetary policymakers appear to be in the other direction.  Inflation continues to be subdued, as this plot of one of the Fed's preferred measures, the ""core"" deflator for personal consumption expenditures, shows:
The red line is drawn at 2%.  Measures of expected inflation are also below 2%.  David Beckworth recently argued that the Fed is acting as if 2% is a ceiling, not a target - he suggests the Fed's behavior is consistent with it aiming to keep inflation between 1% and 2%. But the the Fed declared in 2012: ""The Committee judges that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate."" If the goal is to ""anchor"" expectations at 2%, the Fed is at risk of failing, but the greater threat to its credibility seems to be too little inflation, not too much.",58d7dd3e-09d5-4c43-a445-45afcf22a74a,Blog,2015-09-10T12:58:41Z,Twenty-Cent Paradigms,"A Note on ""Credibility""",1.0,News

2012,"Filed Under: Analysts Upgrades • Market News 

Pool (NASDAQ:POOL) was upgraded by Zacks from a “sell” rating to a “hold” rating in a research report issued on Monday, Analyst Ratings Net reports. 

According to Zacks, “Pool Corp.’s should continue to benefit in the near term from base business sales growth, along with favorable trends in the housing market. The continued strong growth in the pool renovation category along with the reasonable growth of green segment’s sales (the Horizon segment) is another positive. However, the new pool construction remains well below the pre-recession levels, which is a cause for concern. Further, the seasonality of Pool’s business would remain a headwind. Further, currency headwinds weighed on international sales.” 

In related news, Director George T. Haymaker sold 7,000 shares of Pool stock in a transaction on Friday, August 14th. The shares were sold at an average price of $70.80, for a total value of $495,600.00.

5048,"Today, the North Dakota State Quarter Coin remembers the day, September 8, 1883, when a young Theodore Roosevelt stepped from the train in the western wilderness of what is now North Dakota. 
 
In his book, Roosevelt’s Ranch Life in North Dakota, Albert Tangeman Vollweiler included descriptions of Mr. Roosevelt’s arrival and his efforts as a cattle rancher. 
 
===== 
 
It was into this region that Theodore Roosevelt came in September, 1883. 
 
He had never been naturally robust and, therefore, by hard effort, he had learned while yet in his teens, to box, to ride, to shoot, and to stay out of doors with nature till he loved to do this. 
 
After he had served several terms in the New York Assembly, when he was yet a slender young man of twenty-six, he came over the Northern Pacific for a hunting trip in the Little Missouri Valley. 
 
When he arrived at the squalid shack town of Little Missouri on the west bank of the Little Missouri River, opposite which Medora was later built, he went to the rude hotel, taking his baggage along. 
 
This consisted chiefly of a fine collection of rifles. One was an Express, inlaid with gold plates engraved with hunting scenes. The one he usually used, however, was a Winchester of 45-90 calibre. 
 
The hotel was known as the Pyramid Park hotel. It was built of logs and was managed by E. H. Bly of Bismarck who made his living by cutting logs for ties and by boarding such men as came to Medora. 
 
It was the only building at Medora besides the station. The entire upper floor of the hotel consisted of a room which contained fourteen beds, and Roosevelt occupied one of these. 
 
The next day he met a ranchman, J. A. Ferris, who happened to be in town and, after a bargain had been made, the latter took him eight miles southward to his ranch, Chimney Butte. 
 
Here the party outfitted and, with ponies, blankets, rifles, and food, proceeded fifty miles southward. They returned late in the fall after a successful hunt. 
 
If this country supported such numbers of wild animals it would also support herds of cattle and so, before leaving, having been attracted by the health- giving life of a cattle ranch, Roosevelt purchased Chimney Butte Ranch. 
 
This included the horses and cattle that were marked with a Maltese Cross on their left hips, a few rude buildings and corrals, together with grazing rights over the surrounding region. 
 
Roosevelt retained the services of the former owners, Sylvane Ferris and A. W. Merrifield, to manage his new property. 
 
Most good cowmen used a Texan breed of cattle because of their size and their ability to withstand the winter. This was especially true of experienced cowmen who came from the South. 
 
Easterners usually made poorer stockmen unless they stayed long enough to learn the cattle business by experience. 
 
Roosevelt labored under this handicap. The cattle business was new to him and to his foreman, Sylvane Ferris. 
 
The latter had come from Canada and had previously hunted or worked on the Northern Pacific railroad. 
 
The year following Roosevelt’s purchase of Chimney Butte, he had shipped in to his ranch many carloads of Minnesota dogie cattle. 
 
They had no pride of ancestry, nor great size nor hardiness to withstand the winter. These things tended to preclude the possibility of making large profits. 
 
Roosevelt never owned any land in North Dakota. The land of the government was used freely by all ranchmen before it was surveyed and homesteaders came. 
 
Since there were no fences in the early stages of the ranching industry, the brand indicated the owner. 
 
The region was well adapted for cattle raising. The buttes break the force of the winter winds and the clusters of plum and buffalo-berry bushes, ash, box-elder, elm, and cedar trees afford natural shelter for stock. 
 
Grazing is good the year round, for the short nutritious grass ripens early. It thus escapes frosts and retains its food value and is as good as hay when obtained on exposed places in winter. 
 
The region soon built up rapidly. Eastern capitalists invested their money and men of intelligence, sometimes with a college education, and hardy, trusty pioneers managed their ranches, while Texan cowboys came to work on them. 
 
The latter formed the bulk of the population, so that the country west of the Missouri resembled the southwest more than the country east of the Missouri. 
 
Soon the valleys held great herds of cattle that found there abundant food both summer and winter. 
 
The cattle with the Maltese Cross brand now numbered about 3000. Eighty ponies were kept to help take care of them. Six men were employed in summer and three in winter. 
 
Their wages were about $35 to $40 per month with “room” and board. The foreman, Sylvane Ferris, was financially interested in the undertaking. 
 
In 1884 Roosevelt started a new ranch on untrodden ground at Elkhorn, also on the Little Missouri river, forty miles north of Chimney Butte. 
 
Here he built a very substantial log cabin out of logs that were all squared. It was a much better cabin than the one at Chimney Butte and served as Roosevelt’s headquarters. 
 
After he abandoned it, it was used as a lumber yard by the surrounding settlers. 
 
In 1904, there were only a few logs left to mark the spot where it stood. 
 
This ranch used an elkhorn and triangle for its brand and was managed by Sewall and Dow. 
 
The largest number of cattle on Roosevelt’s two ranches at any one time was about 5,000. 
 
They roamed from the Kildeer Mountains on the north to the Chalk Buttes on the south. 
 
… 
 
Young Roosevelt, like any new comer in the west, found people waiting for him to show what kind of a man he was. 
 
Bull-whackers, buffalo-hunters, broncho-busters, cow-punchers, and mule-skinners stated that this new eastern dude would soon be returning home. 
 
“Four-eyes,” one of them called him, because he committed the unpardonable offense in this country of wearing spectacles, though most people called him “Mr. Roosevelt.” 
 
When he brought in cattle they looked with furtive glances at the “stuck up tenderfoot shassayin’ ’round, drivin’ in cattle and chasin’ out game.” 
 
Even the unprejudiced waited askance till he made good. This he soon did. At intervals he would go out hunting for a day and sometimes make long trips. 
 
The hunger, cold, and wet inevitably encountered were lost on him. Though no crack sharpshooter or broncho-buster he was a good shot, a good rider, and took his medicine like a man. “Fer a critter with a squint he war plum handy with a gun,” remarked one pioneer. 
 
On the round-up he neither asked nor received any favors. He worked hard like any other cowboy, whether it was in the sweltering heat of midsummer, or in a blinding blizzard in early winter. 
 
He helped break his ranch horses, and rode both good and bad. 
 
Once, while on a round-up he was thrown from the saddle and broke the point of his shoulder; at another he cracked a rib. Being 100 miles from a doctor, these injuries had to heal themselves, and, besides, he had to get thru his work as best he could. 
 
Dantz tells us that the hard work on the round-up told on Roosevelt till be became rather gaunt, yet with grim, bull-dogged energy, he went thru it. On all occasions he fraternized with the cow-boys; he rode, ate, and slept with them; and at night listened to their simply told stories before a campfire.

1747,"Jens Fahrbring overcame illness to fire a stunning 64 and take a share of the lead after the second round of the 72° OPEN D'ITALIA presented by DAMIANI. 
 
The Swede won the D+D REAL Czech Challenge in May on the Challenge Tour but has missed the cut in all four of his European Tour events so far this year. 
 
He looked very much like he belonged on Friday, though, as he picked up shots on the 11th and 12th before giving one back on the 13th but further gains on the 14th, 16th and 17th saw him turn in 32. More birdies followed on the first, second and sixth, and a four on the ninth moved him into a share of the lead with Lucas Bjerregaard. 
 
The duo are 13 under par, two shots clear of Pedro Oriol, Romain Wattel, Fabrizio Zanotti and overnight leader Nicolas Colsaerts, but Fahrbring admits he has been battling a cold as well as the course. 
 
""I am quite surprised where I am because I was not well at the start of this week,"" he said. ""I picked up a cold and a fever last week in Kazakhstan on the Challenge Tour so yesterday was a struggle and I didn't expect to play so well. Today was a little better in terms of how I felt, and perhaps being unwell helped calm me down and lowered my expectations. 
 
""It was great to be out there with Lucas as he was playing well and we have played a lot of golf together over the years so I think we helped each other along. 
 
""Winning this year on the Challenge Tour has taught me a lot about my game. The more you can do that and put yourself under pressure then the better player you will become. Hopefully that helps into this weekend but this is the first time I have been this high at a European Tour event."" 
 
Big-hitting Bjerregaard, who is 118th in the Race to Dubai, made two birdies on his opening nine but an eagle on the first proved the catalyst as he picked up shots on the third, fourth and eighth to sign for a 65. 
 
""It was great to be able to follow up yesterday's score with another good one today – I can take a lot of confidence from that,"" he said. ""I didn't play as well as I did yesterday, especially off the tee but I made some good par saves. 
 
""I am looking forward to the weekend – hopefully I can keep it going and draw on the experiences I have built up to get into contention. It's been a tough summer for me so it's nice to be in this position again."" 
 
Oriol also went round in 65 as a blistering back nine of 29 catapulted him up the leaderboard. The 29 year old was level at the turn but five birdies and an eagle on the way in took him to 11 under alongside Wattel who followed up an opening 67 with a 66. 
 
Colsaerts looked like he was going to slip away from the pack as he bogeyed the third and fifth holes and was level par for his round as he stood on the 16th tee. But back-to-back birdies got him to 11 under. 
 
Zanotti also birdied the 16th and 17th on his way to a 67 with the Paraguayan yet to drop a shot this week. 
 
Martin Kaymer and Bernd Wiesberger are well placed for the weekend in the group at 10 under alongside Rikard Karlberg, David Lipsky and Andrea Perrino, who is the leading challenger from the home contingent. 
 
Danny Willett, who is currently second in the Race to Dubai, birdied four of his last five holes to get to nine under, the same score as playing partner Miguel Angel Jiménez and Peter Lawrie. 
 
There was disappointment for home favourite Matteo Manassero who finished one shot adrift of the cut line on three under while Italian golfing great Costantino Rocca, playing in his final European Tour event, shot a level par 72. 
 
He finished the tournament eight over after an 80 on Thursday but that did not dampen the spirits in emotional scenes on the 18th green as he bade farewell to his home crowd.",2a7551be-75d9-4c80-8354-841fb6ba066e,News,2015-09-18T17:28:24Z,PGA European Tour,Fahrbring fights fever to lead in Italy,0.0,Blog
250,"(BelTA) – Industrial companies of Belarus and India intend to enter third-country markets with a common brand. Belarusian Deputy Industry Minister Dmitry Korchik made the statement during the online conference hosted by the BelTA website on 24 September. 
The official noted that during the latest session of the Belarusian-Indian intergovernmental commission the sides discussed the establishment of Belarusian industrial enterprises in India using the economic conditions the Indian side offers. Apart from that, an agreement to start assembling Belarusian tractors in India was signed. “As far as assembly enterprises are concerned, we are now looking into the matter together with Indian partners. It is necessary to decide on joint actions in October because there are certain peculiarities to take care of. As you know, India is an internationally recognized leader in tractor manufacturing. The country puts serious effort into developing the automobile engineering industry. We should find a joint niche, a joint product in order to get it made at assembly enterprises in India,” explained the Belarusian Deputy Industry Minister. 

At the same time shipments to third countries — Africa and Asia — where India already enjoys certain influence are under consideration. “We are talking about a new product in the countries where Belarus is not present for now while India has achieved certain success. We plan to reach those markets with a joint brand, a joint product in order to further develop our export geography. We cannot stay idle in this regard. It is necessary to act as fast as possible to agree business operation terms with the partners, to make up our minds on the products we are going to assemble together, and the technologies and conditions for setting up the joint ventures. The work has to be completed in H1 2016 at the latest,” informed Dmitry Korchik. 

The official also said he stays in touch with Indian partners of the Belarusian automobile manufacturing company BelAZ. There are plans to set up a service center by the end of the year. It will allow shipping more mining vehicles. “Those are complicated vehicles. It would be very hard to sell them in this region without comprehensive aftersales service,” explained the Deputy Industry Minister. 

The official pointed out that just like China and Pakistan India represents a serious market for Belarus. Among other things Belarus intends to be part of the Make in India program. “The program is a major step on the part of the Indian government to attract investors, develop the manufacturing industry and other ones. India has created the program to get investments and create jobs. The country does not want to import merchandise. India wants to make it instead. It is a good offer for us,” Dmitry Korchik was convinced. 

In his words, the Make in India program provides for creating more attractive conditions — customs, taxation, transport, and manpower ones — for foreign companies. Belarusian companies such as MTZ, BelAZ, MAZ, and Gomselmash can take part in the program.",da26a5c8-1a30-49f3-a819-89c348687d2a,News,2015-09-24T12:48:19Z,Belta,"Belarusian, Indian industrial companies to bring common brand to third-country markets",0.0,News

2619,"Wolfsburg head coach Dieter Hecking was at a loss for words after watching his side's second-half capitulation in a shock 5-1 defeat to Bayern Munich.      

Die Wolfe went into the half-time break with a 1-0 lead thanks to a 26th-minute Daniel Caligueri strike. 

However, Robert Lewandowski single-handedly dismantled Wolfsburg with five goals in nine minutes after coming on as a substitute at half-time. 

""For all the quality displayed in the goals that were scored, even if there was some fortune involved, something like that just shouldn’t ever happen,"" a dismayed Hecking said after the game. 

""We had a good first half, kept Bayern at a distance from our goal and took the lead, but didn’t have the luck on our side with Guilavogui’s shot against the post.  

""What happened then is unexplainable - but it must be said, conceding five goals in nine minutes is not acceptable! We shouldn’t have conceded the 1-2 directly after the 1-1. 

""Then we lost our shape completely. Bayern made use of the decisive situations and went in pursuit of more. Based on the quality they possess, we have to accept this drubbing, although we were good in the first half.""

3374,"SPRINGFIELD — Motor-vehicle crashes are the number-one cause of death among children ages 1 to 19. As part of National Child Passenger Safety Week, Sept. 13-19, Safe Kids and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) have joined forces to urge parents not only to use car seats and seatbelts for their children and others, but to register their car seats and take action during a recall. 
 
In 2014, more than 6 million car seats were recalled for a safety defect — the largest car-seat recall in U.S. history. Yet, according to NHTSA figures, fewer than half of those car seats received the necessary repair. The reason? Only 42% of parents in a recent study said they filled out and returned the registration card — meaning, on average, six out of 10 parents risk not hearing about a car-seat recall in a timely manner directly from the manufacturer. 
 
“Registering your car seat after purchase is as important as buckling up to keep your kids safe in the car, since a defect has the potential of resulting in serious injury to your child should an accident occur,” said Mandi Summers, co-coordinator of Safe Kids of Western Mass., headquartered at Baystate Children’s Hospital. 
 
Safe Kids and NHTSA urge all parents and caregivers to follow these steps to ensure their child is protected in a vehicle: 
 
• Register online with your car-seat manufacturer or www.safercar.gov/parents . You’ll need the model number and date of manufacture found on the label of your car seat. Or, fill out and mail in the registration card that came with your car seat. It already contains your car seat’s information. 
 
• Visit the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s website at bit.ly/recalledseats to check if your car seat has been recalled. You will need the name of the manufacturer, model number, and date of manufacture. A label on your car seat should have all this information in one place. 
 
As for older children, “it’s a proven fact that kids look to their parents when it comes to setting a good example. So, adults need to wear their seatbelts at all times and make sure that everyone from other adults to kids are buckled up in their car,” said Summers. 
 
Safe Kids offers the following car-seat checklist for parents and caregivers, so as not to put a child at risk by making sure they buckle up the right way on every ride: 
 
• My child always rides in a back seat and never in front of an airbag. 
 
• Everyone in my car buckles up on every ride using the right car seat, booster seat, or seatbelts for each person’s age and size. 
 
• My child’s car seat has all of its parts, labels, and instructions, and has never been in a crash. 
 
• I follow the instructions for my car and my car seat so that my child is buckled in correctly. 
 
• I never leave my child alone in a car. 
 
Seventy-three percent of car seats are not used or installed correctly, and when used correctly, child safety seats can reduce the risk of death by as much as 71%. 
 
Safe Kids hosts car inspection events across the country, where certified technicians can help you learn to install your car seat properly, as well as double-check your work on an already-installed car seat and inform you if your car seat has been recalled. To schedule an appointment with Safe Kids of Western Mass. for a free car-seat inspection, call (413) 794-2255.",31468f76-4bd9-4eb6-8b1b-c9be958ea04b,News,2015-09-15T18:32:16Z,Cambridge College Healthcare News,"Child Passenger Safety Week Emphasizes Proper Car-seat, Seatbelt Use",0.0,Blog
228,"Search the term ""cut crease"" on YouTube and you'll find hundreds of tutorials on the eye makeup look. Just as the name describes, it's a technique used to define the crease by ""cutting"" across it with a contrasting eyeshadow color and little to no blending. 
 
""If done right, a cut crease will change your makeup game if you have a medium to heavy fold. It lifts your eyes and makes them appear more open,"" says makeup artist and YouTuber Sona Gasparian . ""You instantly lift your eyelids with this technique. And what's great about it is that you can go super soft or really dramatic depending on your mood."" 
 
If you're new to the technique, she says a good tip is to keep the intensity on the outer corner of the eyes. 
 
""Start slow and build the intensity to achieve the most natural look,"" she says. ""The best way is to keep your eyes open when placing your cut crease. Look straight in the mirror and place a line where you want your new fold to appear, and start to build the shadow over the line blending upward."" 
 
Gasparian says she likes to keep her makeup looks natural, so she blends her cut crease a little more than usual and demonstrates it in her Taylor Swift Bad Blood Makeup Tutorial below:

3554,"The beautifully moody portrait of Stratford musician Dayna Manning offered an artful contrast to the real-life singer-songwriter who was a guest at Tuesday's unveiling of the restored murals in Allen's Alley.

Manning's engaging smile--while not evident in the portrait--was ever present at the event, as she accommodated numerous requests for photos beside the Kato-created work.

""My reaction is the same as when it was made originally,"" said Manning of the Alley gallery, before organizers hustled her off to ribbon-cutting duties with musician and actor Cedric Smith.

""It's really an honour to be a part of this.""

The portrait of Manning is among about a dozen visual tributes to local musicians, including the Perth County Conspiracy, Loreena McKennitt and The Revols' John Till, Richard Manuel and Ken Kalmusky.

""This is really amazing. It does definitely feel like playing in the big leagues for me,"" said Manning, a critically-acclaimed musician in her own right, both as a solo artist and as part of the Stratford-based Trent Severn with Emm Gryner and Laura C. Bates.

Another person with a constant smile at the ceremony was Shannon Stewart. She's the chair of the beautification subcommittee of Stratford City Centre's Business Improvement Area, and helped spearhead the restoration project.

""This is really a community effort. Everybody came together on it,"" she said.

""It's awesome.""

Preparations began in July, when local artisans started scraping, sanding and patching the graffiti-covered portraits.

Their efforts allowed artists Carla Coles and her husband Scott to begin their painstakingly detailed restoration of the murals.

Staying true to the mural artists' work was made easier thanks to photos e-mailed to the Coles of the originals, courtesy of former Stratford city councillor Chris Rickett. He first suggested the outdoor portrait gallery around 2007.

Getting them back to their original look took about three solid days' work from dawn to dusk, Coles said.

And now that it's done?

""I love it,"" she said, echoing the view of others in attendance.

""And I was glad I could be a part of it.""

The restored portraits are now covered by a graffiti-resistant coating, Stewart noted, which should help deter vandalism.

At the opening, guests were also able to view a variety of laminated pictures--attached to the alley's wooden beams--showing dozens of other notable musicians from the local scene.

Stewart credited feedback from a local Stratford Facebook page and the efforts of staff at the Stratford-Perth Archives for the addition of the pictures of bands and individuals that further illuminate the local music scene.

""Unfortunately we can't put everyone on the walls,"" Stewart said.

Stratford City Centre BIA marketing assistant Kim Griffiths said the restored alleyway artwork improves the look of a busy thoroughfare that links the Erie St. parking lot and the downtown.

""To date, it's not been a very pleasant place to go through,"" she said. ""But now that it's been turned around, I think it looks fantastic.""

Offering a direct connection with the historic past of the alley at the ceremony were Irene Ruscetta and her brother Michael Bomasuit, descendants of James Allen and his wife Josephine (Bomasuit), who established Allen's Fruit Market on Wellington St. in 1912.

Ruscetta recalled working as a youngster in the store, helping her dad, eventual storeowner Michael Bomasuit, unload truckloads of fresh produce from a five-ton truck that he eased backwards down the alley in the 1940s.

To see the respectful restoration of a piece of the Stratford landscape so closely connected to her family impressed her.

""It's beautiful,"" she said.

""I think it's marvellous that a proper tribute has been given to the artists here.""",b9c4105a-3b36-4472-8cd0-bbc131d7c047,News,2015-09-08T21:46:11Z,London Free Press,Celebrating our musical heritage,0.0,Blog

5573,"Hard to believe we are already staring at week three of the season. It's moving right along and the Raiders, sitting at 1-1, have the opportunity in Cleveland to start the season 2-1 for the first time since 2011. Both teams are 1-1 with both winning last week thanks to an air assault.

No more going streaking

For the past decade plus, the word ""streak"" has not been a positive one in Oakland. It usually is preceded by the word ""Losing"". There are many of those ugly streaks in play right now that would only get uglier with a loss on Sunday. By the same token, all of those long streaks would come to an end with a win. The biggest streak is not having won in the Eastern Time Zone in six years -- that's 16-straight losses. There are several of them which could either be prolonged or stopped Sunday. See them all here.

Browns have the book on Derek Carr

If there's any team in the NFL who knows Derek Carr's, it's the Browns. That's because their offensive coordinator is Raiders former quarterbacks coach, John DeFillippo. No one on the NFL level has spent more time with Carr, so no one is in a better position to exploit his weaknesses. The Browns as a team played against Carr last season as well, which gives the defense some recent experience to draw from.









Josh McCown gets the nod over Johnny Manziel

Once Josh cleared concussion tests, the Browns wasted no time in naming him the team's starter. They did that despite Johnny Manziel's three touchdown performance last week in a win over the Titans. McCown was the starter heading into the season and was knocked out of the team's opener early. It's clear Pettine wants to give McCown every opportunity to show he can be their starter without fear of losing his job because of an injury. But is he a better option than Manziel? Hard to say. Though Manziel would have given the Raiders' defense one more thing to worry about with his mobility.
Run. The. Ball. (For real this time)

We keep saying this and it keeps not happening. But this time it must happen. Latavius Murray is putting up good numbers, but has gotten the ball about half as much as he probably should in this game. The Browns have the worst run defense in the league and one of the better pass defenses in the league. Add that the Raiders defense has given up 33 points in each of their first two games, and you also have the need to try and control the clock and keep the Browns offense off the field.








What does Derek Carr do for an encore?

Derek Carr is coming off his best game as a Raider. It was the first time in his career he threw for over 350 yards, three touchdowns, and put the team on his back to lead them to a come-from-behind victory late. He doesn't need to do it again in this one and he probably shouldn't. The Browns know he CAN do it. They must respect his ability to go down the field. He's got them right where he wants them. He doesn't need to be spectacular Sunday. He just needs to be efficient. Don't try to do too much. This isn't fantasy football and the only numbers that matter are the ones in the W and L column.








Dead last defense

There is no team in the NFL this season which has given up more yards (889) than the Raiders over the first two games this season. They also give up a league worst 6.6 yards per play. That's friggin pathetic. It has resulted in the second most points given up (66) over the firsts two games. Missed tackles are plaguing the Raiders' defenders, especially among the linebackers and safeties. They also don't have a single sack on the season. Derek Carr can't bail them out every game. Especially against a tough pass defense like the Browns have. Time to find ""what you're good at"" as Ken Norton Jr said this week. Like, quickly.
CWood recovery

Charles Woodson dislocated his shoulder late in the Raiders season opening loss to the Bengals. He miraculously play the entire game last week against the Ravens, but it was quite clear he was nowhere near 100%. He missed three tackles in the game, solely because he couldn't wrap up. Now another week has gone by, and he practiced full on Thursday and Friday which suggests he is back healthy and should have full use of both his arms. That's huge for the Raiders who desperately need him to be at his best.









TJ Carrie vs Travis Benjamin


The Browns best receiver these days is Travis Benjamin. The Raiders best cornerback is TJ Carrie. He should receive the task of shutting down the speedy Benjamin, who has four touchdowns this season. And you can bet the OU grad Carrie will have a few folks in the stands hoping to see him do well.

Austin Howard vs Paul Kruger


Last season when these two teams met, Kruger welcomed Derek Carr to his nightmare by sacking him three times. He will be trying once again to put Carr to sleep and most of those times, it will be Howard who will try to prevent the Browns from releasing a horror sequel.

J'Marcus Webb vs John Hughes


Thus far this season, Webb has held up fairly well considering the former tackle was a complete unknown as a guard when the team signed him this offseason. He will often be facing the Browns' best defensive lineman Sunday. Hughes had two sacks and a forced fumble last week on the elusive Marcus Mariota to help the Browns knock off the Titans.

4573,"Before we left Taitung, we returned to the International Landmark we had visited the previous evening. In the daylight it didn’t look quite as impressive, but the view of the shoreline from the structure was worthwhile.It was a lovely fine, warm day as we entered the beautiful East Rift Valley, between the Coastal and Central mountain ranges. The wide valley contains some of Taiwan’s best farming country so we were treated to stunning views all day.  
Not far along, we turned off the main road, wound through small plots of intensive agriculture and climbed into the foothills of the Central range to see the Liji Badlands. Once mudflats, this severely eroded landscape has been uplifted and folded by the action of the two continental plates that collide in this valley (the Philippine Sea Plate sliding under the Eurasian one).From one side of the valley we crossed the vast watercourse of the Beinan River and ascended the other range to Luye Gaotai, the place where the Hot Air Balloon festival takes place. There against the spectacular mountain backdrop we watched paragliders swoop and swirl before coming in to land. This vantage point also provided a wonderful overview of the extent of the valley and of the confluence of the Beinan and Luye rivers. A fabulous place.We continued through the valley, passing through an area of extensive rice cultivation. The paddies, both large and small, covered all available space and even came into town.At Chishang, considered to the Taiwanese ‘home of rice’ because of its prize-winning varieties and high productivity, we stopped to sample some of the champion produce, in the form of a lunch box. We also visited a display of old rice-growing equipment – the wooden husker, the raincoat made of straw, the tools that showed just how hard the farmers worked.On we went, the cloud now spilling over the mountains. Again we turned off the main road on to another twisting and winding road that climbed steeply, taking us to the peak of 60 Stones Mountain. Once again, the views of the valley were fantastic, but the real purpose of the visit was to see the remainder of the bright orange flowers, known to the Taiwanese as Golden Needle flowers. These flowers bloom only at the Autumn equinox and a few days ago would have blanketed the mountaintop.Back down on the mountain and further up the valley, we stopped at the marker for the Tropic of Cancer (no wonder it has been so hot an humid) then later at icecream o’clock, at a former sugar cane factory.The weather had closed in by this stage and we passed through showers, but by the time we reached Liyu (Carp) Lake it merely looked threatening. The cloud cover, in fact, was appreciated as it made it rather pleasant for the bicycle ride we made (with compulsory tea stop) around the pretty lake. What fun!As we approached Hualien, we stopped for a meal of fried noodles, before entering the city (pop about 100,000) to check in at the hotel.It had been a quieter day, but one full of amazing sights.",a2af57df-09e6-4b6c-86c3-ae8aff7c5578,Blog,2015-09-25T13:34:17Z,Gotta travel:,Day 6: Thursday 24th September 2015 – Taitung to Hualien,1.0,Blog

5892,"MONTREAL – NDP Leader Tom Mulcair is promising to boost the aerospace industry, a sector that has seen hundreds of layoffs this year. 
 
Mulcair said Tuesday he would set up a $160-million, four-year fund to help small- and medium-sized aerospace companies adopt new technology and increase production in an effort to better compete globally. 
 
The plan would require firms to show a plan to create jobs and provide professional training to workers. 
 
Mulcair also committed to setting aside $40 million over four years in the Canadian Space Agency’s space technology development program to help companies commercialize new technologies. 
 
He said he would also lead trade delegations to help promote Canada’s aerospace industry. 
 
“Canadian aerospace innovators and manufacturers need a prime minister in Ottawa who will be a champion for the them on the world stage — and I will be that champion,” said Mulcair, who was campaigning in Montreal, a hub for the aerospace sector that hosts the headquarters of companies including Bombardier and CAE.

2071,"Hewlett-Packard Co, which is splitting into two listed companies later this year, said it expects to cut another 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its enterprise business as part of its efforts to save $2.7 billion in costs.

The 76-year-old company is separating the faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations, to be called Hewlett Packard Enterprise, from its computer and printer businesses.

The expected job cuts will result in a charge of about $2.7 billion, beginning in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement on Tuesday.

""We've done a significant amount of work over the past few years to take costs out and simplify processes and these final actions will eliminate the need for any future corporate restructuring,"" Chief Executive Meg Whitman said.

The total job cuts planned by the company as part of Whitman's multi-year restructuring plan was 55,000 as of October last year. HP had more than 300,000 employees as of Oct. 31, 2014.

In the latest third quarter HP's revenue from personal computer and printer businesses, its largest, fell 11.5 percent. Enterprise services division sales dropped 11 percent, while revenue at the enterprise group rose 2 percent.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise is expected to have more than $50 billion in annual revenue and report adjusted profit of $1.85 to $1.95 per share in 2016, HP said on Tuesday.

The business is expected to report free cash flow of $2.0 billion to $2.2 billion in 2016, at least half of which is expected to be returned through dividends and share buybacks.",775f1f8d-f57b-4bb3-9f35-79c88a3210eb,News,2015-09-15T22:41:47Z,Melbourne Age,"Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 more jobs",0.0,News
1472,"Ophthalmology company Ocata Therapeutics (NasdaqGM:OCAT) said on Tuesday that it has treated the first atrophic (dry) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patient under its Phase 2 clinical trial using its proprietary RPE cells. 
 
The company added that the trial will evaluate the safety and explore efficacy as compared to a parallel control group. 
 
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) occurs when light-sensitive photoreceptor cells in the macula, located in the centre of the retina, break down causing vision loss. Photoreceptor breakdown is a consequence of loss or damage to the RPE layer. As the disease progresses, patients may have difficulty reading and recognizing faces. 
 
This Phase 2 study will include up to three cohorts of up to 20 subjects each. Each of the cohorts will receive one week of immune suppressive therapy prior to surgery and then different immune suppression regimens following transplantation of the cells, to determine the safety and tolerability of zero, six and 12 weeks of post-transplant systemic immune suppression. Untreated patients will receive placebo treatment similar in appearance and administration to those who have received cellular transplants.

The former Weekend Today show weather presenter, who was fired from the Nine network in December, will take over from long serving Sydney newsreader Geoff Field on 2DayFM and other newsreaders around the country in the coming weeks.

""A new streamlined news service on The Hit Network will broadcast news weekdays from 4pm-6pm across all metro markets in the coming weeks,"" Hit Network's chief Craig Bruce said on Wednesday night.

Freedman, the daughter of decorated racehorse trainer Lee, began her radio career in January. As well as news reading she will continue to co-host the nightly and nationally syndicated The Scoopla Show with former 2DayFM breakfast host Jules Lund.

""Emma's profile and popularity is at an all-time high,"" Bruce said. ""She's one of the brightest new stars in the radio industry, and we are excited to increase her on air role across the Hit Network starting in a few weeks.""

According to SCA sources who spoke to Fairfax, news of Freedman's extended role came as a shock with many affected staff deciding to quit immediately. Fairfax understands that, at the time of publishing, at least two presenters have announced their resignation.

Geoff Field, who has been with 2DayFM for close to 20 years, announced he had left the network on Twitter earlier on Wednesday.

""Thanks to the listeners and staff that have supported me at 2DayFM since 1997. For the most part, it's been a blast. Sorry for the confusion, but I have left the radio station...I'm overwhelmed by the messages and texts, as you may understand I can't make any further comment other than to say I have left 2DayFM,"" he said.

Source: International Atomic Energy Agency – IAEA – Press Release/Statement: 
 
Headline: Radiation technology has the potential to boost industrial development, improving productivity in a cost-effective and environmentally-sound way, was the conclusion of this year’s Scientific Forum. Held over two days during the IAEA’s General Conference, the event Atoms in Industry – Radiation Technology for Development reviewed best practices on the uses of nuclear techniques to improve and control the quality of products and processes. 
 
Leading experts, academics and industrial representatives met in Vienna, Austria, from 15-16 September 2015 to discuss how the atom can help close the gap between developing and developed countries. Cutting-edge technologies help countries to establish modern industries, which are vital for economic growth.   
 
“Nuclear techniques are used extensively in industry to increase product quality and safety, benefiting both producers and consumers. Radiation tools make industrial production cleaner and more effective,” said IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano at the opening of the Forum. 
 
His address was followed by keynote addresses by Sergey Kirienko, Rosatom Chief Executive Officer, Ratan Kumar Sinha, Chairman of India’s Atomic Energy Commission, and young scientist Taylor Wilson, a 21-year-old nuclear physicist from the United States. 
 
Experts went on to explore the benefits radiation technology can bring during six sessions:   
 
Battling the bugs 
 
Starting off with the health sector, the Scientific Forum considered the advantages of gamma rays – a form of electromagnetic radiation – in sterilization over other methods. This technology is very cost-effective, with 95 per cent reliability in operation, low maintenance needs and minimal technical training requirements. It also allows the sterilization of products in their final wrapping and without any chemical additives, making it a green technique. As the global medical device market expands rapidly, the application of radiation techniques in this industry will be even more relevant, the session concluded.   
 
Linking the chains 
 
Radiation processing of polymers – complex chains of molecules – is by far the largest application of the atom in industry. It makes materials more stable, durable and resistant – from computers to car parts and cosmetics, many everyday items are improved with radiation. This session explored what this technique can offer in a variety of sectors, including agriculture and medicine, and highlighted the fact that it is very environmentally friendly.    
 
Solutions for pollution 
 
The benefits of electron beam technology, which uses free energetic electrons to treat materials, was the topic in focus during the third session. The use of e-beam is of great value in protecting our planet. Every year, pollution increasingly affects the atmosphere and water resources. Radiation techniques offer a cost-effective way to treat persistent pollutants in air and water, and help identify contaminating pathways. The session concluded that, although only developed in the last two decades and applied in a few countries, electron beam technology has great potential as a tool to tackle environmental pollution. 
 
Tracing the pathways 
 
Radiotracers and nucleonic gauges are used extensively in industry in both developing and developed countries. From the protection of coastlines to the oil and mining industry and civil engineering, this well-established technology optimises processes, monitors signs of wear and corrosion and gives reliable information about phenomena that cannot otherwise be seen. Radiotracers are already being deployed in numerous industries, but there many more where this unique technique can be of great use, the session concluded. 
 
Bolstering safety and quality 
 
Non-destructive testing (NDT) has become indispensable in modern industry was the message from this session. This technology helps industries to detect faulty equipment, optimize production and ensure the safety of processes. The training and certification of NDT personnel is a challenge, especially in developing countries, and creating a qualified workforce to carry out NDT effectively needs to be given priority. A suggestion from the session was the creation of a global network to help train and certify professionals worldwide. 
 
Rays of hope 
 
There are many promising applications of radiation technology. The Forum discussed examples of how these techniques can preserve the past by protecting our cultural heritage, help us in the present by creating materials to support agriculture, and lead us into the future through its application in the field of nanoscale engineering.  
 
The Forum was concluded by a panel discussion on how radiation technology can be used and transferred, featuring IAEA Director General, Mahama Ayariga, Minster of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation of Ghana, Jose Fidel Santana Nunez, Vice Minister of Science, Technology and Environment of Cuba, and Lydia Parades Gutierrez, Director General of the Mexican National Institute for Nuclear Research. 
 
Radiation technology is applied in many sectors in Ghana, and from medicine to agriculture, we have seen how greatly these techniques benefit various industries, Mr Ayariga said. He added that in the future, radiation techniques will play an even a more essential role in many sectors in his country. 
 
During the last decade Cuba has made a great progress in deploying radiation technology in different industries, continued Mr Santana Nunez. From setting up new irradiation laboratories to developing hydrogel membranes for treating patients to training qualified personnel in non-destructive testing – Cuba’s industry has made good use of radiation technology over the past years, he emphasized.

STATEWIDE Western Region  Think global, buy local 
 
  

    Downtown Asheville is filled with funky shops such as LOFT, short for ""lost objects, found treasures."" 

 

Asheville has a unique character, with its dozens of locally owned shops and restaurants drawing more than nine million tourists annually. Now, fears that national retailers are ready to pounce on the central business district are prompting talk of a possible ban on chain stores. The controversy stems from plans by Anthropologie, which sells women’s clothing and home decor items at more than 200 stores, to add a shop on North Lexington Avenue. It would join a store owned by its Philadelphia-based parent company, Urban Outfitters, which is among a handful of chains in the downtown area. Almost 90% of downtown Asheville’s businesses employ fewer than 20 people. To preserve that local flavor, Asheville Downtown Commission member Rebecca Hecht started an online petition urging officials to either regulate or place a moratorium on chain stores downtown. “Allowing large chain and formula stores downtown will eliminate the unique appeal at the core of Asheville’s identity,” the petition says. “These types of businesses will erode what we value as a community and patina our image of a city that supports small business.” Supporters worry that downtown Asheville could resemble King Street in Charleston, S.C., a haven for national retailers. “As Asheville grows, we ought to put measures in place to protect and grow our local businesses, retain and strengthen our neighborhoods and put our locals first,” Franzi Charen, director of Asheville Grown Business Alliance, wrote in an email to supporters. Her group promotes local companies. The love-the-locals effort faces a stumbling block in state laws that limit the ability of municipalities to add zoning restrictions on chains. Another issue is how to define a chain. Downtown Asheville doesn’t have a Starbucks — the Seattle-based giant has chosen not to open a store there — but some businesses have other locations, including Tupelo Honey Cafe, Kilwins chocolate shop and Mast General Store, says Meghan Rogers, director of the Asheville Downtown Association. The city council hasn’t taken up the issue. Rogers cites better parking, a grocery store and more retail choices as top needs for downtown. While the association has not taken a side on the issue of restricting chains, she agrees that the local focus is popular. “I think a big reason people enjoy downtown Asheville is that it is different.”

In support of Omantel to meet continuously growing network coverage and capacity demands, Ericsson recommended Zero Site, a solution that has zero footprint to avoid complex site acquisition and has low power consumption. 
The solution makes bulk site acquisition possible in cities and also supports mass deployment. The concept in this case is to integrate a small cell solution with billboards to provide optimal urban coverage with minimal visual impact. Zero Site is a smart and compact solution suited to hot-spot deployments, that improves revenues by meeting user demands on network coverage and data, with reduced operational costs 
 
Salalah Gardens Mall attracts massive numbers of tourists and visitors during the Khareef and was tested in the pilot Zero Site solution deployment in time for the season start. The site has proven successful in carrying significant amounts of voice and data traffic and in improving Omantel customers’ experience.

1097,") - HyperSolar, Inc. (OTCQB: HYSR), the developer of a breakthrough technology to produce renewable hydrogen using sunlight and any source of water, today announced that it had reached 1.55 volts (V), a significant milestone achievement in its effort to split water molecules for the production of renewable hydrogen fuel.

While the Company had previously met the challenge of exceeding 1.23 V, the theoretical minimum voltage needed to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen, a minimum of 1.5 V is needed to do so for commercially viable real world applications. Examples of these commercial applications include hydrogen-charging stations for fuel-cell vehicles, or warehouse transportation for big box retailers. The 1.55 V breakthrough, in a low-cost single solar cell element, is representative of the tremendous progression of the technology, as the Company announced its 1.4 V breakthrough just one month ago. The results were recorded at the University of Iowa campus research location where researchers are currently focused on further increasing the voltages and currents achievable from their inexpensive light driven hydrogen generation particles. 

Following this breakthrough, the company will focus its efforts on increasing the hydrogen production efficiencies of these particles by bonding the ideal fuel production catalyst to the low-cost high-voltage solar cell. In order to achieve this, the company is currently exploring two parallel approaches. The first is to identify materials that interface with well-known hydrogen production catalysts, such as the platinum on solar particles, to improve sunlight-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency. The second is to pursue methods that further increase photo voltages of solar particles to greater than 1.7 V that allow integration of cheaper earth abundant catalysts without significant loss in hydrogen production efficiency. ""This announcement represents one of the most important milestone achievements the Company has made to date,"" said Tim Young, CEO of HyperSolar. ""Both the University of Iowa and University of California, Santa Barbara teams have been instrumental in spurring the speed at which our technology has developed, resulting in this voltage breakthrough. We are focused on identifying the next steps for the technology that will make it possible for us to scale up to make a commercial technology that can produce hydrogen fuel at or near the point of distribution, using only water and sunlight."" 

HyperSolar's research is centered on developing a low-cost and submersible hydrogen production particle that can split water molecules under the sun, emulating the core functions of photosynthesis. Each particle is a complete hydrogen generator that contains a novel high voltage solar cell bonded to chemical catalysts by a proprietary encapsulation coating. A video of an early proof-of-concept prototype can be viewed at http://hypersolar.com/application.php.

About HyperSolar, Inc.

HyperSolar is developing a breakthrough, low cost technology to make renewable hydrogen using sunlight and any source of water, including seawater and wastewater. Unlike hydrocarbon fuels, such as oil, coal and natural gas, where carbon dioxide and other contaminants are released into the atmosphere when used, hydrogen fuel usage produces pure water as the only byproduct. By optimizing the science of water electrolysis at the nano-level, our low cost nanoparticles mimic photosynthesis to efficiently use sunlight to separate hydrogen from water, to produce environmentally friendly renewable hydrogen. Using our low cost method to produce renewable hydrogen, we intend to enable a world of distributed hydrogen production for renewable electricity and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.

2354,"  
 
I have long been interested in the problems associated with excessive smartphone use because we live in a time when our lives are dominated by technology. Smartphones (as well as laptops and tablets) seem to dictate our lives now. 
 
Take a look around in public. Everyone seems to be glued to their smartphones everywhere you look. Many people have forgotten what it feels like to simply be a person and live life in the present. 
 
Back in August 2013, I did an experiment. I turned my smartphone off for one month. That’s right. For one entire month, I was without a smartphone. There was no texting, no phone calls, no mindless internet browsing, no anxiously checking my e-mail every two minutes, and no social media. 
 
I know what happens when you start putting your smartphone down and I’m happy to share the benefits with you. Here they are: 
 1. You will initiate small talk on a more consistent basis.  
Stand in a line at any place or event with a decent wait time. What do you usually see? You usually see a line of people just standing there mindlessly staring down at their smartphones. They are oblivious to the world around them. They have little awareness of their surroundings. Their only focus is whatever is on that smartphone screen. 
 
This really is a shame because when you think about it, you have to wonder about all the missed opportunities. Who knows what kind of friendships or relationships could be started just by putting your phone away and engaging in simple small talk? 
 
You will know if you decide to put the phone away and pay attention to your immediate surroundings. You will have no other choice. Without a smartphone, life is boring if you just stand around and don’t talk to people. Without a smartphone to rely upon for ‘entertainment’, you will place evolutionary pressure on yourself to start making small talk with strangers. From there, the possibilities are endless. 
 2. You will become more observant.  
When you allow yourself to be dominated by constant smartphone use, life follows one big pattern. You tend to do the same thing over and over throughout the week. You get up. You go to work. You talk with the same people every day. You go to lunch. You leave work. Maybe you go to the gym or take a class. And then you go to bed and do it all over again. This is reality for many people, especially those who are constantly on their smartphones throughout the day. You don’t really remember the details about your day. You don’t really remember specific people that you come across. It’s all one big blur. 
 
This will change once you start putting your phone down more. Again, you will not be able to rely upon your smartphone as a means of numbing yourself from the rigors of your daily routine. You will be forced to actually look around and gain a deeper understanding of life around you. You will become more observant of people. You will also become more observant of the social situations developing in front of your eyes. 
 3. You will give yourself a chance to reset your dopamine levels to “normal”.  
It’s very common for people to say that we are “addicted to our smartphones.” But what does this really mean and is this accurate? It’s somewhat true. It’s not so much that we are addicted to our smartphones. In reality, we are addicted to dopamine , the “pleasure chemical” that is released in our brains as a reward mechanism. Simply put, we live in a society where constant access to technology and instant gratification at our fingertips has our collective dopamine levels way out of whack. 
 
Recent research indicates that dopamine causes “ seeking behavior .” Our brains are always seeking stimulation- hence, why we are a “click happy generation.” How many times have you found yourself searching on Google or YouTube for something specific only to end up looking at something totally unrelated an hour later. We’ve all been there. 
 
When you make it a habit to put down your phone, you will start to alleviate this extreme seeking behavior. Eliminating the constant clicking, searching, and communicating will enable you to give yourself a chance to reset your dopamine levels to their normal range. 
 4. You will relax and be in a good mood more often.  
Constant smartphone use throughout the day can take its toll on you. This is especially the case if you make it a long term habit. Constantly looking at a small screen and mindlessly clicking away wears down your brain. Again, this relates back to abnormal stimulation and dopamine release. This habit, that so many of us engage in, adds another element of stress to our lives that is simply unnecessary. 
 
The world is stressful enough. People have jobs. People have personal lives. Stress is inevitable. There is no reason to add to it. Yet, this is exactly what many of us unknowingly do when we do something like check our e-mail inbox ten times just on the elevator ride up to the office. 
 
When you eliminate, or at least drastically cut down on this habit, you give yourself a chance to relax. Suddenly, life doesn’t seem to be moving so fast. There is time to fully enjoy something as simple as going to the grocery store. When you are able to put your phone down and relax, you will give yourself the opportunity to be in a good mood.

An Exploration into Fern Genome Space. Genome Biol Evol 7:2533–2544. [ View abstract on publisher’s site ] 
 

  Abstract  
Ferns are one of the few remaining major clades of land plants for which a complete genome sequence is lacking. Knowledge of genome space in ferns will enable broad-scale comparative analyses of land plant genes and genomes, provide insights into genome evolution across green plants, and shed light on genetic and genomic features that characterize ferns, such as their high chromosome numbers and large genome sizes. As part of an initial exploration into fern genome space, we used a whole genome shotgun sequencing approach to obtain low-density coverage (∼0.4X to 2X) for six fern species from the Polypodiales ( Ceratopteris , Pteridium , Polypodium , Cystopteris ), Cyatheales ( Plagiogyria ), and Gleicheniales ( Dipteris ). We explore these data to characterize the proportion of the nuclear genome represented by repetitive sequences (including DNA transposons, retrotransposons, ribosomal DNA, and simple repeats) and protein-coding genes, and to extract chloroplast and mitochondrial genome sequences. Such initial sweeps of fern genomes can provide information useful for selecting a promising candidate fern species for whole genome sequencing. We also describe variation of genomic traits across our sample and highlight some differences and similarities in repeat structure between ferns and seed plants.

Ball State gained 181 yards on the ground against Northwestern on Sept. 26, led by Riley Neal, Darian Green and James Gilbert. The Wildcats had only allowed 110 yards per game before playing the Cardinals. DN PHOTO ALLISON COFFIN 
   
On the surface, Ball State's 24-19 loss at No. 17 Northwestern doesn't seem like a bad one based on the Wildcats' prowess. 

Northwestern was a clear favorite in the game, and many people probably picked Ball State to get blown out. 

Ball State controlled most of the game, however, and either tied or outscored Northwestern in three quarters on Sept. 26. Missed chances and the Wildcats' big third quarter doomed the Cardinals in the loss. 
 
“Again, not a bad effort by any means,"" head coach Pete Lembo said. ""But one where we needed to make a few more plays in six or seven different situations."" 

After taking an early 3-0 lead against the nation's No. 10-ranked defense coming in, Ball State got the ball back after a turnover on downs. They pushed the ball down the field, but freshman Morgan Hagee missed a 43-yard field goal. 

Hagee missed two field goals in the game, finishing 2-of-4. 

Just a few drives later, the Cardinals were knocking on the door again. A 34-yard James Gilbert run took the ball to the 4-yard line to end the first quarter. 

But quarterback Riley Neal, in the first start of his career, fumbled the snap while attempting to hand it off, and the Wildcats recovered 

Another chance to extend the lead, another costly mistake. Neal agreed with Lembo that it may have been the difference in the game. 

“If I [didn't] fumble that ball on the 5-yard line, we’d have more points on the board,” Neal said. “We left plenty of points on the field where it should have been a different ball game.” 

Ball State's defense stood up to Northwestern by forcing four turnovers. They gave up a big touchdown in the second quarter and 17 points in the third, but gave the offense good chances to put points on the board. 

The Wildcats had turned the ball over just three times coming into the game. 

“Our defense played well enough that if were able to get those 14 points, [we'd be] a little bit happier right now — a lot happier right now,” Lembo said. 

Still, after the Wildcats' big third quarter, the Cardinals had their chances.  

They put together one touchdown drive in the second half, but failed to take advantage of short field on a few occasions. 

While there were positives — Ball State fared better offensively against Northwestern than Stanford or Duke — the combination of mistakes added up in defeat. 

Lembo knows this was a game that his team had every opportunity to win, but couldn't pull through. The Cardinals (2-2, 1-0) can take the positives from this game, however, and carry them into the rest of their Mid-American Conference schedule. 

Ball State will face another tough test next week against Toledo, who sits right outside the top 25 after a 3-0 start with wins against Arkansas and Iowa State.",e38ec51b-82b9-451b-8829-9cadf1ef433d,News,2015-09-27T22:49:30Z,Ball State Daily News,"Turnovers, mistakes take away from strong performance",0.0,News

The school district posted a message on its Facebook page, explaining the decision to evacuate the schools immediately. 

According to the CDC , Legionella is a bacteria found naturally in the environment, especially in warm water systems. The bacteria can be inhaled via contaminated air.  It is not transmitted from person to person. Legionella can cause a form of bacterial pneumonia known as Legionnaires’ disease. Most cases are treatable with antibiotics. Those who have compromised immune systems and the elderly are at the most risk for complications. 

Legionella can also cause a flu-like disease called Pontiac fever, which is milder in nature. 

According to the CBS Chicago , no reports of illness so far have been reported at the three schools that were evacuated. ",bb1f9d79-79b6-4e0f-a903-d99b1ca22f9e,News,2015-09-23T17:59:43Z,WHIO TV,3 schools evacuated after Legionella bacteria found,0.0,News

3646,"Warren Joseph Gehrt, 94, known to be a pioneer in social services, died peacefully in his sleep Friday, Sept. 4, 2015. 

Warren Gehrt led an interesting life beginning with his graduation from Bushwick High School at the age of 16. He drove trucks for Dutch Schultz at the age of 16 until his father, Rudy, read him the Mann Act. Warren played third base on a Yankees farm team during the Depression and played ball with Phil “Scooter” Rizzuto and was pals with Dallas Green. During World War II, Warren served his country in the Navy and was stationed in Brazil. He was stationed in Washington, D.C. where he worked in Navy Intelligence decoding radio transmissions. He operated a Bombe - the allied counterpart to the Enigma machine. The Bombe was something like a mechanical computer. It's rotors were used to crack the Nazi's Ultra code. 

Warren was a graduate of Georgetown University in 1947 and subsequently from Catholic University with a master’s degree in Social Work in 1949. 

He served under governors Elbert N. Carvel, Charles L. Terry Jr., Russell W. Peterson, Sherman W. Tribbitt and Pierre S. DuPont IV. He first arrived in Delaware from Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. in 1961, and was appointed superintendent for the Woods Haven Kruse School for Girls. In 1963, he was appointed superintendent of Ferris School for Boys; in 1968 he was appointed Commissioner of Corrections, and in 1971 was appointed superintendent for the Hospital of the Mentally Retarded. He subsequently became the director of the Division of Mental Retardation, retiring from state service in August 1983. 

There were many “firsts” in Warren’s career. In 1963, he appointed Ms. Dorothy Banton as superintendent of Woods Haven Kruse School for Girls, the first African-American to head a state agency that served all races. He oversaw the construction of the new correctional facility in Smyrna beginning in 1969. He was instrumental in making institutional changes that included the elimination of the whipping post, creating halfway houses and enabling prisoners to have conjugal visits. Most importantly, he worked successfully to repeal laws on the sterilization of the mentally challenged. 

In 1972, he was bestowed the honor of Social Worker of the Year by the Delaware Chapter of the National Association of Social Workers. In 1974, he was the first state director of mental retardation in the U.S. to graduate with distinction from the federally sponsored Management Training Program conducted by the Center for the Development of Learning Disorders at the University of Alabama. 

Warren served on many commissions and committee over the years, such as the executive director for the Youth Services Commission, the State Game and Fish Commission, the Delaware Commission on Interstate Cooperation and the Governor’s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Clinical Justice, just to name a few. 

In addition to his parents, Warren was predeceased by his son, Kenneth R. Gehrt. Survivors include his wife of 70 years, S. Ray Ferguson Gehrt; daughter Bonnie G. Davis (Gary) of Kennett Square, Pa.; son Thomas Gehrt (Victoria) of Kennett Square; son Russell L. Gehrt (Kathleen) of Frankford; three grandsons, Michael J. Brennan (Francelle Lim) of Brooklyn, N.Y., Matthew Gehrt (Elizabeth) of Kennett Square and Aaron Gehrt of Frankford; and five great-grandchildren, Oona, Jacob, Benjamin, Flint and William. 

A memorial service will be held at Chandler Funeral Home, 2506 Concord Pike, Wilmington, Monday, Sept. 21, at 11:30 a.m., where friends may call beginning at 10 a.m. A committal service with military honors will follow in Delaware Veterans Memorial Cemetery at 1 p.m.

4082,"Guam Police Department Chief Joe Cruz said that a planned expansion of surveillance capabilities up and down Tumon would help the Guam Police Department in its fight against criminal activity. 
 
Cruz said the use of that surveillance equipment in the information age pays dividends in cracking down on crime. As he broached the subject of video surveillance in Tumon while speaking to members of the Rotary Club of Tumon Bay on Tuesday about his plans for GPD, Cruz was asked about body cameras for officers and vehicle cameras in patrol vehicles.  

He said body and vehicle cameras could become important tools for police use in Guam and spoke of the help that private surveillance footage provides to criminal investigators.  

The chief said he has directed division heads to look at body cameras for police officers. “I think it’s definitely the way forward for GPD's future and is something the firearms committee is taking a very close look at right now,” Cruz said. 

Committees 

As part of his management structure, Cruz has created five internal committees, of which the firearms committee is one, to look at various issues and needs of the police department. While the firearms committee researches the pros and cons of the use of body cameras, Cruz said he is aware that at least three GPD police officers utilize the device on their own accord. 

Two of the officers assigned to the Dededo Precinct Command and one officer assigned to the Tamuning/Tumon Precinct Command used personal funds to purchase the devices for use while on-duty. “I will tell you that body cams are worth their weight in gold. They pay dividends – to make sure that what's happening is accurately being accounted for. It helps the community and it helps the police officer,” Cruz said. 

Cruz said he plans to integrate the body cams systemwide, but cost will ultimately be the deciding factor. ""Upfront, we are looking to have two to three body cams per shift at every precinct throughout until we can outfit everybody with a body cam,"" Cruz said. “If there are any issues of impropriety, we get the recording, we simply play it back and we settle the issue.” 

Cruz said that technology in police vehicles would also be looked at. Currently, the chief said only a number of patrol vehicles assigned to the GPD Highway Patrol Division are outfitted with video vehicle cameras. ""As soon as a police officer activates the top lights, his camera starts recording – so if there are any issues that came up during the pull-over or the traffic stop, all that's on the camera.” 

The vehicle cameras for the highway patrol fleet are funded with federal funds awarded through a grant administered by the Office of Highway Safety of the Department of Public Works. 

Social media 

Cruz also spoke of the recent rash of social media footage that has aided GPD in solving crimes quickly. 

He said GPD is building a library of footage and has linked some criminal activity with the same perpetrator as a result, leading to the successful solving of the crime. 

“In the past, we were not able to capture any of this – now we are building a repository with our criminal investigations divisions to be able to identify who some of these individuals (are),” Cruz said. “We have solved a few of the incidents – some of the crimes that have been committed out there.”",7ad8133e-f788-4eaf-82f9-eaf6894db8b4,News,2015-09-09T14:54:03Z,Marianas Variety - Guam,Police chief: Camera footage pays dividends,0.0,Blog

The UFC 194 card also features the UFC middleweight title fight between Chris Weidman and Luke Rockhold and several other elite level fights.

Aldo and McGregor were set to fight several months ago but an injury forced Aldo out of the fight. McGregor went on to win the interim title beating Mendes and now the stage is set for these two men to finally settle the score and determine who the best 145 pound fighter is in the sport of MMA. McGregor will come into the fight riding a 14 fight winning streak dating back to 2010 but Aldo comes in sporting an even more impressive 18 fight winning streak dating back to 2006.

The other main event will settle a rivalry that has is relatively new in the MMA world. Since dethroning Anderson Silva as the man in the middleweight division, Weidman has defended his title successfully three times against three of the best fighters in the division.

3395,"WASHINGTON , Sept. 1, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Disasters like floods, hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes, and earthquakes are a harsh and frequent reality for much of the country. According to a recent survey conducted by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), progress has been made; however, fewer than half of Americans have discussed and developed an emergency plan with their household. 

Experience the interactive Multimedia News Release here: http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7608151-fema-ad-council-emergency-preparedness/ 
   
Today, FEMA and the Ad Council launched a new series of public service announcements (PSAs) to encourage families to develop an emergency communication plan before a disaster occurs. An extension of the national Ready campaign, the new PSAs launch in conjunction with the 12 th annual National Preparedness Month, serving as a reminder to take action to prepare for the types of hazards that could impact where you live, work, and vacation. 

""The last thing you want to be worried about during a disaster is how to communicate with your family members,"" said Administrator Craig Fugate . ""Have that conversation today. It doesn't cost a thing."" 

The new campaign includes English and Spanish-language TV, radio, outdoor, print and digital PSAs. Created pro bono by Chicago -based advertising agency Schafer Condon Carter , the PSAs illustrate the importance of having a family plan in the event of an emergency by showing real emergency moments and asking the question, ""when is the right time to prepare?"" The viewer is encouraged to develop a family emergency communication plan through the clear message, ""Don't wait. Communicate."" The PSAs direct audiences to Ready.gov/communicate for tools and resources to help develop and practice a family emergency communication plan. 

""Through the Ready campaign, we've made a lot of progress educating and empowering Americans to prepare for all types of emergencies but there are still so many families that don't have a plan, "" said Lisa Sherman , President and CEO of the Ad Council. ""Having these conversations is really important and can have a big impact on our families' safety in the event of a disaster."" 

""SCC is honored to work with the Ad Council and FEMA on the Ready campaign,"" said David Selby , President and Managing Partner of SCC. ""This new campaign provides powerful imagery and a critically important call-to-action that we hope will cause individuals and families to pay attention, lean in and, ultimately, take action."" 

Localized television and radio PSAs were created and will be available for 27 states, Guam , the U.S. Virgin Islands , Washington D.C. , and New York City as part of an ongoing collaboration with state and local emergency management partners. These PSAs drive audiences to their local organization's website for resources and information pertinent to their area. 

As an extension of the national Ready campaign, versions of the PSAs were created for Ready New York , a local initiative that was launched in partnership with the New York City Office of Emergency Management in 2009. Tailoring the message to the unique challenges faced by people living in New York City , audiences are directed to call 311 or visit NYC.gov/readyny, where they can find preparedness resources, including 11 Ready New York guides in 13 languages and audio format. 

Managed and sponsored by the Ready campaign, National Preparedness Month is designed to raise awareness and encourage Americans to take steps to prepare for emergencies in their homes, schools, organizations, businesses, and places of worship. National Preparedness Month is an opportunity to share emergency preparedness information and host activities across the country to help Americans understand what it truly means to be ready. 

National Preparedness Month Weekly Themes 
Week 1 (September 1–5) Flood  Week 2 (September 6–12) Wildfire  Week 3 (September 13–19) Hurricane  Week 4 (September 20–26) Power Outage  Week 5 (September 27–30) Lead up to  National PrepareAthon! Day , September 30 
National Preparedness Month culminates with National PrepareAthon! Day on September 30 when cities and counties across the country are planning community-wide events bringing together schools, their business community, government, faith leaders, hospitals, individuals and families, and others to participate in community-wide preparedness drills and activities for hazards that are relevant to their area. 

Since the launch in 2003, the Ready Campaign has received nearly $1.2 billion in donated media. The Campaign helps to generate more than 92 million unique visitors to Ready.gov. The Ad Council is distributing the new PSAs to media outlets nationwide this week, and the PSAs will run in donated time and space.

2456,"Sky gazers can look forward to a rare treat this coming Sunday when a super blood moon will grace the skies for the first time in 30 years. The unusual occurrence, which sees the sun, earth and moon come together for a lunar eclipse, will be doubly special as it coincides with a supermoon, a phenomenon when the moon’s mostly elliptical orbit brings it closest to Earth’s surface. 
 
According to Phys.org , the celestial show will be visible from the Americas, Europe, Africa, west Asia and the east Pacific, and sky gazers can witness the blood-soaked supermoon for just over an hour from 0211 GMT. 
 
In the weeks leading up to the spectacular event, meteorologists, astronomers, bloggers, as well as amateur star gazers, have all dubbed the extra-large moon as a ‘blood moon’, primarily because of the reddish tint the moon gets from an eclipse. Though Sunday’s lunar eclipse will be the fourth in a tetrad, with three lunar eclipses have already taken place in the last two years, the unusual size and the color of the moon on Sunday is keeping astronomers juiced up for the event. 
 
Sam Lindsay of the Royal Astronomical Society was one of the people to have expressed his excitement at the prospect of the approaching blood supermoon. 
 
“It will be quite exciting and especially dramatic. It’ll be brighter than usual, bigger than usual.” 
 
Wired reports that the moon on Sunday evening will appear about 14 percent larger and 30 percent brighter than Earthlings are used to seeing it. Our planet will take position in a straight line between the moon and the sun, in the process blotting out the direct sunlight that usually makes our satellite glow whitish-yellow. But on Sunday, some light will still creep around Earth’s edges and be filtered through its atmosphere, casting a strange red light, thus creating the ‘blood moon’. 
 
On Sept. 27, stargazers will be seeing red: http://t.co/gPtOdeHOPe  #Supermoon  #LunarEclipse  pic.twitter.com/aiAbfmQq4i 
 
— Notre Dame News (@nd_news) September 23, 2015 
 
For people who are not yet 33 years of age, this will be their first chance to witness a blood supermoon, and the rare occurrence will not take place again until 2033, according to CNN. 
 
However, much of what will be witnessed will depend on the weather, and consequently where the event is being viewed from. For people in the United States, residents in large parts of the Northeast and East Coast of the country may have to be disappointed, with Accuweather (via Mass Live ) predicting cloudy skies on Sunday evening. 
 
But residents and sky gazers will do well to anticipate the blood moon in any case, especially if the weather is clear. For those of you who might not be in the best place to view the blood moon in its full splendor, NASA’s Marshal Space Flight Center plans live coverage and commentary of the eclipse on its UStream channel, which can be viewed by clicking here . The Slooh Community Observatory network will also be livestreaming views of the blood supermoon from different continents, including a spectacular broadcast from Stonehenge, starting at 8 pm EST.

1463,"BEIJING – She is only 10, but Dai Jingya has already come face to face with more heads of state than most people will in their lifetimes. She has rubbed shoulders with Chinese President Xi Jinping four times, and greeted the leaders of Singapore, Afghanistan, Myanmar and Denmark. 
 
Dai is one of a group of children culled from Beijing schools to welcome the constant stream of foreign dignitaries coming to the capital to pay their respects, alongside People’s Liberation Army soldiers and a host of top Chinese officials. 
 
The ritual has echoes of both the personality cult rule of Communist founding father Mao Zedong and the way emperors embodied the state in the era of imperial China, experts say. 
 
In closely choreographed performances that always take pride of place on the state broadcaster CCTV’s main evening news, Xi and his guest first review the honor guard at the Great Hall of the People on Tiananmen Square. 
 
The pair then walk past the phalanx of around 40 children, who on cue burst into ecstatic screams of “Welcome to China” in Chinese and English, jumping up and down waving a Chinese flag in one hand and the visitor’s emblem in the other. 
 
“I really like coming here to welcome the foreigners, we get to miss school and sometimes I get to see myself on the evening news,” Dai said, waiting under a hot sun for a ceremony to begin. 
 
But she has yet to see U.S. president Barack Obama, she said, adding he was the leader “I want to see the most.” 
 
The welcome ceremonies have a long history, but the presence of children was re-introduced after Xi took power in 2012, following a decades-long gap. 
 
When then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru visited China in 1954, he became the first non-Communist leader to visit the People’s Republic. 
 
It was a crucial endorsement of Mao’s rule with the world order in flux as decolonisation and revolution redrew the map, and his host pulled out all the stops in the way only an absolute leader can. 
 
About 300,000 people lined the roughly 10 kilometers of the route the prime minister’s limousine took from Beijing’s airport to the city, according to a report at the time in London’s News Chronicle. 
 
The distance was “walled by unbroken banks of humanity, clapping, cheering and crying,” wrote the newspaper’s correspondent James Cameron. 
 
Under Mao, smiling children in red neckerchiefs from the Young Pioneers, a Communist Party youth organization, were frequently on hand to welcome foreign leaders. 
 
After his death in 1976 and the end of the tumultuous Cultural Revolution, China moved the formal welcome ceremonies from the airport to the Great Hall of the People, and two years later the government stopped organizing citizens to line the roads. 
 
In 1989, under Jiang Zemin, the protocol department ordered that primary and middle school students no longer take part in welcoming state visitors. 
 
But Xi — who is seen as having acquired more power more quickly than any Chinese leader since Mao — has revived the practice. 
 
“It’s the same as when China had an emperor,” said Ines Pires, founder of the Brussels-based International School of Protocol and Diplomacy. 
 
“China has a more collectivist way of thinking and these ceremonies are supposed to be a representation of the state and of all of China.” 
 
A few other countries use children in similar ceremonies, but rarely with such prominence. 
 
Before anyone of importance arrives, teachers drill the students with military-like commands on when to begin cheering and when to stop. 
 
“This is a great opportunity,” one teacher chastised an unruly boy. “Do not embarrass yourself and your school by doing anything that would upset the leaders.” 
 
When Xi arrives, the teachers must look on from afar, a mix of pride and nerves as they snap photos with their phones, while hoping their charges behave in the presence of power. 
 
During the welcome event for Singapore’s president, Xi, normally perpetually solemn, cracked a smile and waved as he walked the children, the only sign of joy he displayed during the proceedings. 
 
After the leaders left, the children rushed into the bathroom, each declaring they were unafraid of Xi, and taunting a boy they said was scared. 
 
When Equatorial Guinea’s President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo visited many students were excited, albeit largely unaware of his nation’s existence, let alone the many human rights violations Obiang is alleged to committed during more than 30 years in office. 
 
It was the second time 8-year-old You Ziniu had been mustered to join the welcoming committee, after he greeted Obama last year. 
 
“I liked Obama’s visit better,” he said. “I’ve never heard of this country.”",94088255-a8fc-4bc0-93ee-37b4c6fb1995,News,2015-09-17T08:10:26Z,Japan Times,China revives ecstatic children greeter teams for state visits,0.0,Blog

3965,"Also Tommy Thrall, Ray Sayre and Dan Shugart honored. 
 
Press release: The Southern League of Professional Baseball Clubs has announced the Pensacola Blue Wahoos as the Don Mincher Organization of the Year. Votes for both awards were received from league general managers. 
 
Since joining the Southern League in 2012, the Pensacola Blue Wahoos have produced an unmatched experience in baseball. Recently chosen as the “Best View in MiLB,” the Blue Wahoos organization prides itself on outstanding service to its loyal fanbase. In less than four years from its inception, Pensacola Bayfront Stadium saw its millionth fan walk through the turnstiles on Friday, May 8 of this year. 
 
Before the season started, the Blue Wahoos welcomed a new member to its ownership group when two-time Masters Champion Bubba Watson joined Quint and Rishy Studer at the helm of the franchise. Watson made multiple appearances in Pensacola this season, only adding to the fan experience when he jumped on a dunk tank to support local charity. The Blue Wahoos have fully ingrained itself with the local community and have provided the springboard to grow the downtown Pensacola area into a popular destination. 
 
Named in honor of the late Don Mincher, who served as Southern League President from 2000-11, the Organization of the Year is awarded to the Southern League club exemplifying the complete baseball franchise. By claiming this honor, Pensacola will be the Southern League’s nominee for the John H. Johnson President’s Trophy, which will be presented at the Baseball Winter Meetings in December. Pensacola previously won this award in 2012. 
 
Tommy Thrall has been named the Radio Broadcaster of the Year , as selected by his peers and the League’s general managers. Thrall, who has eased listeners with his conversational tone, vivid descriptions and keeps our listeners up-to-date of former Blue Wahoos in the Major Leagues, has been with the team since its inaugural 2012 season. Besides calling games on a daily basis, the Northwest Missouri State University grad, serves as the play-by-play announcer for Blue Wahoos television games on Cox Sports Television. 
 
Ray Sayre, Director of Sports Turf Management for the Blue Wahoos, is this year’s Groundskeeper of the Year , as selected by the league’s field managers and umpires. He won this honor in 2014 and 2013. Sayre has been with the Wahoos since the team’s inaugural season. Growing up in Lexington, Kentucky, he began his turf career working on the athletic fields for the University of Kentucky. Before making the move to Pensacola, Sayre worked for several minor league teams including the Louisville Bats, the Greenville Drive and the Bowling Green Hotrods. 
 
Dan Shugart, Sports Director at WEAR-TV, is honored with the Southern League’s Sports Media Award. Covering the team since the inaugural season, Shugart and WEAR constantly covers games, events and offseason activities to produce year round coverage in Pensacola. He continues to go over and beyond in his coverage of the team and league by producing stories to show the positive impact of the Blue Wahoos in the community. Shugart is such a staple in the community that the Wahoos organization help a Dan Shugart bobblehead night in 2014 with his signature mustache wiggling on the figurine. 
 
Winning these awards represents the latest in a growing list of accolades for the Blue Wahoos. The 2012 the team was named the Southern League Organization of the Year, Ballpark Digest’s Organization of the Year, Ballpark of the Year by Baseballparks.com and Bruce Baldwin being named Jimmy Bragan Executive of the Year. In 2013 the team was named Stadium Journey’s Best Minor League Ballpark Experience and the Southern League Southern League Community Service Award and Groundskeeper of the Year. In 2014 the team was again awarded Southern League Groundskeeper of the Year and Stadium Journey’s Best Overall Ballpark Experience Runner-Up.

1503,"OTTAWA — The independent watchdog who enforces Canada's election laws says there's nothing wrong with the Conservative party employing the services of controversial Australian campaign fixer Lynton Crosby. 
 

                            The Canada Elections Act specifies that it is illegal for anyone who is not a Canadian citizen or permanent resident to ""in any way induce electors"" to vote or refrain from voting for a particular candidate. 
 

                            But a spokeswoman for the commissioner of elections says providing advice to a campaign or working for a campaign is not considered inducement. 
 

                            The Conservatives confirmed Thursday that Crosby has been helping Stephen Harper's campaign team since March — primarily doing analysis of polling data — and continues to do so. 
 

                            Lynton has been dubbed the ""Wizard of Oz"" for his role masterminding four consecutive election victories for former Australian prime minister John Howard and British Prime Minister David Cameron's re-election earlier this year. 
 

                            But he's also been described in less flattering terms as ""a master of the dark political arts"" and the ""master of dog-whistle politics"" — a reputation New Democrats are using to try to scare up donations to their party. 
 

                            In a fundraising email blast to supporters Friday, the NDP referred to Crosby as an ""evil genius"" and ""an ultra-right-wing political strategist from Australia."" 
 

                            ""He has a long record of helping Conservatives win around the world and now he's set his sights on our election. The Conservatives really will do anything to win — we can't let them,"" says the email. 
 

                            ""Stephen Harper's friends have played dirty in each of the last three elections. This one will be no exception."" 
 

                            Greg Barns, an Australian lawyer and political commentator, agreed with that assessment. 
 

                            Employing Crosby ""shows Harper is desperate,"" Barns said in an email to The Canadian Press. ""Why? Because Crosby has one strategy only and it is scare campaigns. Appeals to insecure voters on issues like race."" 
 

                            Barns predicted Crosby will try to paint NDP Leader Tom Mulcair and Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau as ""soft on migration and crime."" 
 

                            Crosby could not be reached for comment. 
 

                            Duff Conacher, co-founder of Democracy Watch, blasted the elections commissioner for ""choosing not to enforce the federal elections law by ignoring the intention and spirit of measures in the law."" The section of the law barring foreign involvement is titled ""non-interference by foreigners"" and explicitly says a foreigner may not ""in any way"" try to influence voters, he noted. 
 

                            But Conservative incumbent Jacques Gourde said there's nothing unusual in hiring the services of an outside adviser. 
 

                            ""When we're talking about political mechanics of elections, it's international now,"" Gourde said in Victoriaville, Que., where Harper had a campaign event Friday. 
 

                            ""There are advisers everywhere in the world that give advice to many people. Advice is never unwelcome, and it would be applied by people in Canada. 
 

                            Indeed, Harper's Conservatives have been tapping the wisdom of John Howard's Australian strategists since at least 2006. 
 

                            Both the NDP and the Liberals have sought advice in the past from U.S. President Barack Obama's strategists.

333,"Two fraudsters who laundered £2.6 million meant for a new Channel Island airport runway have been sent to prison. 
 
John Woodhatch, aged 58, of Boleyn Court in Buckhurst Hill, was sent to prison for five years for his part in a “payment diversion” fraud on the States of Guernsey. 
 
Adrian Taylor, 44, from Swanley in Kent, was also jailed for six years when the pair appeared at the Old Bailey last Wednesday (September 9) having both pleaded guilty to money laundering. 
 
The duo contacted the Guernsey Treasury in June 2012 claiming to be from Lagan Construction, which is carrying out a £50 million project at the island’s airport. 
 
The pair told the treasury that they wanted to change the bank account details into which monthly payments were being made. 
 
Once this was agreed and the latest monthly payment of £2.6 million had been transferred into the new RBS account, Woodhatch, who was working as a City broker, immediately instructed the bank to move the funds to accounts in Dubai and Turkey. 
 
Woodhatch told RBS the transfers were mainly to pay for a horse in Dubai, but the bank’s money laundering team was not convinced and referred the matter to the City of London Police in July 2012. 
 
After several days, Woodhatch was arrested and his home and commercial address in the city were searched. 
 
A review of the accounts found that £52,000 of the stolen funds had been transferred to Taylor, who was arrested in October 2012 after he handed himself in to police. 
 
Detective Inspector Rob Stirling, who led the investigation for the City of London Police, said: 
 
“Woodhatch and Taylor thought they were too smart to be caught and would be left free to spend the £2.6 million stolen from the States of Guernsey.

SAN DIEGO -- After missing all of last week, including Saturday's game against the Seattle Seahawks with a shoulder issue, San Diego Chargers inside linebacker Manti Te'o returned to practice on Monday.
""It's a long camp, so coach just gave me the time to recover and get ready, so I feel good,"" Te'o said.
Te'o has missed at least one preseason game due to injury his first three years in the league, and missed a combined nine games over the last two years due to foot issues.
But Te'o said he could have played against the Seattle Seahawks last week if it were a regular-season game, and that he's healthy enough to play when the Chargers take on the Detroit Lions in the season opener on Sept. 13.
""I'm ready to go,"" Te'o said. ""More importantly, I'm more mentally ready to go. Physically, I feel great. But mentally I'm way more prepared.""
Te'o does not know if he'll play in San Diego's final exhibition game on the road against the San Francisco 49ers.
Receiver Dontrelle Inman also returned to practice after missing all of last week with a concussion.
Quarterback Philip Rivers, who suffered an injury to his throwing hand against Seattle, suited up for practice, but just handed off a few times and did not throw during the early portion of practice available to reporters.
Rivers said after the game that his hand is fine and he could have played in the second half against the Seahawks if it were a regular-season game.
Outside linebacker Jeremiah Attaochu did not practice on Monday, and appeared to suffer a right leg injury in the first half against the Seahawks.
Cornerback Chris Davis has not practiced since sustaining a concussion in the preseason opener against the Dallas Cowboys in Aug. 13.
Guard Orlando Franklin returned to practice, but was limited. Others who did not practice include receiver Torrence Allen, guard Johnnie Troutman, center Chris Watt, outside linebacker Tourek Williams, cornerback Greg Ducre, safety Gordon Hill and inside linebacker Kavell Conner.",1152a018-fe37-4ecd-b0cf-728912083b13,Blog,2015-08-31T19:15:38Z,ESPN Feed: - blog,"SAN DIEGO -- After missing all of last week, including Saturday's game against the Seattle Seahawks with a shoulder issue, San Diego Chargers inside linebacker Manti Te'o returned to practice on Monday.

434,"Blue chip miners share prices plummeted as soon as the Australian market opened after a horror night for resources stocks on the London exchange, as analysts warn it is particularly vulnerable to China's slowing growth and prices slump. Blue chip miners share prices plummeted as soon as the Australian market opened after a horror night for resources stocks on the London exchange, as analysts warn it is particularly vulnerable to China's slowing growth and prices slump. In early trade, BHP Billiton shares are down 3 per cent to $23.12 and Rio Tinto 2 per cent to $48.24.

The losses continue the declining trend this year in line with commodity prices. Rio Tinto has lost 14.9 per cent and BHP 22.7 per cent since January, and 5 per cent this month alone.

The decline could see BHP tumble below the year-low of $22.84 reached in August. A fall below this price would see it reach a new seven-year low.

Overnight, BHP Billiton lost 5.1 per cent and Rio Tinto fell 3.2 per cent in London.

The falls come amid as global markets face the inevitable slowdown of the Chinese economy and its demand for industrial metals. On Tuesday the Asian Development Bank lowered its growth expectations for China.

Ratings agency Moody's described the resources sector as the most exposed to China's slowing growth, a call underscored by Credit Suisse, which cut its Chinese forecasts for demand.

""Much of this is a catch-up to current conditions, which remain highly uncertain, but until China demand and emerging market currencies find a floor, it will remain challenging to put an absolute floor on commodity prices,"" Credit Suisse research analyst Liam Fitzpatrick told The Financial Times.

In June, RBC Capital revised its ratings for BHP Billiton to underperform but maintained Rio Tinto at ""neutral"" and South32 at ""outperform"". South32 dropped 1.2 per cent on the London exchange over night.

At the time, EIM Capital's John Robertson warned BHP's had long been overvalued and that he expected it to continue to fall.

""BHP's value proposition has always been overestimated. It was in almost every fund, individual and institutional, and this demand saved it from the reckoning when the sector repriced, but now its day has come,"" Mr Robertson said.

On Wednesday, the company announced an upcoming vote that could see Australian shareholders sacrifice some of the company's franking credits to ensure it can meet its dividend requirements to UK shareholders.

26,"The leader of Iran's legislature has definite views on his country's nuclear deal with world powers. 

Ali Larijani says the agreement is good enough. He adds that United States' reading of that deal, particularly when it comes to sanctions, is not good at all. And he's hoping that the agreement brings change in his country — though not as much as many Iranians would want. 

The lawmaker expressed those views to NPR during a visit to New York. While he is not one of the clerics who hold ultimate power in Iran, he is a consummate insider. He was a top national security official before his election to parliament. His brother leads the judiciary, and the family has important business interests. He is considered a true conservative in his country, and his views open a window into Iran's complex governing elite. 

Larijani supported the negotiations that led to the agreement, which places limits on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of global economic sanctions. He called the final terms ""acceptable."" 

""I believe that we can use this deal as a step we can take to move forward. And at the same time, it is not flawless,"" he said. 

Indeed, Larijani expects lawmakers in Iran's sometimes contentious assembly to complain. 

Critics In The Iranian Legislature  

The assembly speaker met with NPR at a New York hotel. He was dressed in a suit and no tie, in the style of the Islamic Republic. He's in his 50s, old enough to recall all the years from the 1979 Islamic revolution to this historic moment. 

He has held positions in the revolutionary government since its early years. He now leads a legislature that, like Larijani himself, is considered conservative. He says many lawmakers are skeptical of the deal. 

He pointed to provisions he considered unequal. The U.S., for example, can make sanctions snap back into place if it thinks Iran breaks the deal. 

""But that is not true for us. We cannot return to the situation that we were in the past,"" he said. 

Larijani sees many of Iran's concessions — like removing the core of a reactor – as permanent. 

His concerns are the opposite of those voiced by American critics. U.S. skeptics worry Iran is temporarily setting back its nuclear program to get out of sanctions forever; Iranians argue they're setting back their program for sanctions relief that may be temporary. 

Larijani's anxiety was evident in our conversation. ""If something ... happens in the U.S. Congress, or if there are new types of sanctions on us, then they should not expect us to go — to implement. Or if the Americans don't stay true to their obligations on their part, they shouldn't expect us to do it."" 

His remark pointed to one of the sticky points in this agreement. 

It's designed to lift nuclear sanctions against Iran. 

The U.S. says it offers Iran no assurances about sanctions imposed for non-nuclear issues. 

U.S. Says Sanctions Remain An Option  

The United States has insisted it will keep up the pressure against Iran on other issues. 

In an NPR interview in August, President Obama underlined this point:""We'll still have our sanctions in place with respect to non-nuclear activities like sponsorship of terrorism or violation of human rights."" 

That matches what Secretary of State John Kerry told NPR shortly after negotiating the deal. He said the U.S. was, ""absolutely"" free to punish Iran for acts like supporting the militant group Hezbollah. 

So how would Iran respond if the U.S. imposes new sanctions, or reimposes old sanctions, for issues other than nuclear issues? 

Larijani suggested that could lead to trouble. 

""There are different points mentioned in the text that need to be read carefully,"" he said. ""The text said that no country will go after new sanctions."" 

If Iran views the other side as violating the deal, ""we will respond accordingly."" 

The two sides may agree on what the nuclear deal says on paper. But arguments loom over what it really means in practice. 

""I think there are some people who want to wreck the deal, so they are trying to find new ways to make holes or to perforate the deal, but we are not going to do this,"" Larijani said. But, he added, ""if anybody wrecks the deal in any way, then we will know how to respond to it."" 

Will Reforms Follow?  

Larijani's answer to one question was particularly revealing, both in what he said and what he did not say. 

This was the question: Is there a specific economic, political, or social reform that is likely to become reality now? After all, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has indicated that he would like reforms inside Iran to follow a nuclear deal. 

""I think he meant, mostly he meant, economic reforms,"" Larijani answered. ""So, I see very much eye-to-eye with him in this matter,"" Larijani said. ""I think we can make it possible for the economy to thrive."" 

He dismissed questions about political or social reforms. He said nothing of easing Iran's constraints on personal freedom, or the media, or the Internet. He argued instead that Iranian society is more free than that of its neighbors. 

Asked if Iran might now free political candidates who've been under house arrest since a disputed election in 2009, Larijani said only that it was up to the justice system. 

Asked if Iran might free several imprisoned Americans, such as the journalist Jason Rezaian , Larijani suggested that the United States should trade Iranian prisoners for them. 

A Way To Move Forward  

Larijani cautioned that the nuclear deal alone might not transform Iran's relations with the West. ""Iran and the U.S. have this past history that is very dark,"" he said. 

Larijani recited the Iranian view of that history. He didn't mention moments on Americans' minds, like the 1979 hostage crisis, or Iran's calls to eliminate Israel, or Iran's past secret nuclear activities. He talked instead of 1953, when the U.S. supported a coup in Iran. In the 1980's the U.S. supported Iran's mortal enemy, Saddam Hussein of Iraq. 

Working through this history, the soft-spoken Iranian gradually became more heated. 

""I'm not saying that we should live in the past, but we should not try to find dramatic solutions,"" he said, ""and if we see that there is a change in the U.S. attitude toward us, then we can do something with each other."" 

As translated by his official interpreter, Larijani went on to say: 

""You know, these days we are supposed to paving the ground for the ratification and the implementation of the deal. We have to prepare the public opinion for this, but everyday it seems that your secretary of defense [Ash Carter] wakes up in the morning, opens the window, he shouts something at Iran and says that the military option is still on the table. 

So what does this mean? If you really want to do — to have war, then just go with it. Why are you just talking about it all the time? Why is it that you just talk about it? I mean, does — does it solve anything? Is it of any use?"" 

A Farsi speaker employed by NPR heard Larijani's wording slightly differently—he did not literally say ""go with it""—but added that the interpreter properly captured Larijani's meaning and tone. 

A provocative question had led to Larijani's outburst: would he like to invite U.S. lawmakers, many of whom disapprove of the nuclear deal, to visit Iran? 

Larijani concluded his long answer by saying, in effect, that this is not possible yet. 

He described the nuclear agreement as a test for the United States — just as the United States has posed the agreement as a test for Iran.",e9c9d2d9-a5f0-45fa-89ca-bf8470bf87c6,News,2015-09-08T10:07:31Z,WAMC.org,"Iran Parliament Chief: Nuclear Deal Is 'Acceptable,' U.S. Interpretation Is Not",0.0,News

I participated in an Influencer Activation on behalf of Influence Central for  American Express Serve® . I applied for the Serve Cash Back card to facilitate my review and received a promotional item to thank me for my participation. 
 
Budgets help keep us on track and control spending – whether it’s an operating budget for a Fortune 500 company or the grocery budget of a family of four. 
 
Without a budget your monthly grocery expenses can easily get out of hand. But let’s face it, sticking to budget can be hard sometimes – there are always items you want to splurge on. 
 
I’ve put together a list of  tips to help you stay on track and make the most of your hard earned money. 
 5 Tips to Help you Stick to Your Grocery Budget  

  Start meal planning – Creating a weekly meal plan is one of the best budgeting tools.  Taking the time to map out your meals ahead of time allows you to create meals that utilize what you already have on hand and what the stores have on sale.  And, because you know what you’ll be eating for the week, you can easily create a shopping list that is within your family’s budget.  For tips on meal planning, check out this post .  Don’t shop hungry – This tip is so basic but so true!  When we’re hungry, our will power is much lower and we’re more tempted to pick up unnecessary items.   If you can’t shop after a meal, try having a protein-rich snack before you head out.  Keep the kids at home – When possible, shop alone.  Not only will you save time (and your sanity) but kids can kill a budget in the blink of an eye.  They load up your cart with impulse purchases and things you don’t really need (but say yes to because you just want to get out of the store before you go crazy).  Re-evaluate your grocery budget regularly  – Things change…even our eating habits.  Every few months, take time to evaluate your grocery budget.  Have things changed in your family? Do you need to increase or decrease the amount you allotted yourself?  Use a prepaid card  – Use a card like the American Express Serve®  prepaid debit card and preload the exact amount you want to spend on groceries each month.  This will keep you from overspending and help you stay on track.   

 
American Express Serve® prepaid debit card   is a full service reloadable prepaid account that offers convenient and easy access to money management tools at no or low cost plus you can earn cash back on everyday purchases.

( NEWSER ) – Abortion is one of the sins that mandates  automatic excommunication  in the Roman Catholic Church, but for the  Holy Year of Mercy  that begins Dec. 8, Pope Francis says priests can, at their discretion, absolve women for terminating pregnancies,  Reuters  reports. 
 
""Many … believe that they have no other option,"" the pontiff said in a  letter  released today by the Vatican. ""I am well aware of the pressure that has led them to this decision. I know that it is an existential and moral ordeal. I have met so many women who bear in their heart the scar of this agonizing and painful decision."" He then instructs priests to offer forgiveness to women who've had one and who have a ""contrite heart,"" and as long as the priests relay ""words of genuine welcome combined with a reflection that explains the gravity of the sin committed.""

1811,"A mixed jobs report has clouded prospects for the Federal Reserve raising interest rates later this month, experts said, as that uncertainty sent the stock markets into a dive again. 

“If the Fed thought their decision was complicated before, this morning’s employment report will now make it that much more challenging for the Fed to reach a unanimous decision in September,” said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist for Stifel Fixed Income. 

U.S. employers added 173,000 jobs in August — the fewest in five months, but the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent, the lowest in seven years. 

The Labor Department report wasn’t the unambiguous signal many on Wall Street were hoping for and the prospect of higher interest rates weighed heavily on the markets. The Dow fell 272 points, or 1.7 percent yesterday, while the S&P fell 1.5 percent. 

The jobs report is the last major data about the economy before the Fed’s meeting later this month. 

Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said in a speech before the jobs report was released yesterday that it is time to raise rates. 

“It’s time to align our monetary policy with the significant progress we have made” in the economy, Lacker said. 

Still, other Fed officials appear to be more cautious because of concerns over international growth and slow inflation. 

“If the decision was made on labor markets alone, this would encourage the Fed to raise interest rates,” said Sara Johnson, senior research director of IHS Global Insight. 

“Our view is they will take into account a number of other factors, including international problems and inflation.”",ba4818d5-5a40-4912-9709-727b291f00fc,News,2015-09-05T05:43:00Z,The Suit Magazine,"Jobs report complicates Fed rate hike, causing stocks to dive - Boston Herald",0.0,Blog

16,"Listening to politicians campaigning you a picture you get is that after October, Tanzanians will be living in heaven. Candidates’ promises paints a flawless Tanzania in which no one will labour for anything. 

If you critically look at things which politicians in the campaign trail promise they are going to accomplish if elected, you will be petrified. Anyone with sober mind will be horrified and left wondering on how and when these politicians are going to fulfil these pledges. 

It seems also that even those who are defending their seats have forgotten that in 2010 they issued a lot of promises majority of which they have not accomplished. They now go out to dish out even more promises.  

While Mwalimu Nyerere used to tell Tanzanians that they will develop only through hard work, our candidates are competing to show that they have solutions to all problems and these solutions do not entail people working, let alone working hard, to resolve their problems. 

Candidates are promising each and everything but none of them have been heard telling Tanzanians that they will have to toil for them to earn their daily bread. 

Making promises to the effect that people will not be required to work in order to better their lives amounts to making them complacent. And this will not only affect the individuals but the entire nation. For the nation to make strides it needs hard working people who will be able to first change their personal lives and then contribute for the national economy. 

Crave for victory should not blind the candidates and push them to give promises which in actual fact are not reasonable. We should only look back into 2010 and take stock of what was promised and what has been accomplished for us to be able to gauge what promising mean to the individuals and the nation. 

The promises we have been hearing would need a lot of money to be implemented. But we are not told where this money will come from. Other candidates have started to cite natural gas as one source of money with which they will accomplish their promises. But we know that a better expert’s guess is that the next leadership will leave the office before the country starts to see real money from the natural gas. So, there is no point in cheating the public that gas will provide enough money for implementation of these many plans which we are hearing. 

Politicians should campaign knowing that this country or its people are not going to end tomorrow. They should practice considerate politics which respect the fact that cheating would only give them satisfaction but subject the country and its people to pointless argony.

4072,"With paired spokes in a 14 front/16 rear configuration, Rolf's Prima Vigor Alpha wheels are highly distinctive. For a better left-right tension balance, a large non-driveside flange on the rear hub is spaced inwards, and for such a low spoke count tensions are high. The merits of this construction are debatable (truing accurately is certainly harder), but our set was well built, and fewer spokes should mean better aerodynamics.Highs: Looks, weightLows: Price, ease of repair
Rolf’s Delta rim profile is almost a standard vee in appearance, and the rim hides internal aluminium nipples. These, along with small cartridge bearings, mean the wheels aren’t well suited to poor weather riding, and our set needed new bearings after a hard winter’s riding.
Our wheelset weighed 668g front and 848g rear, which is reasonably, but not exceptionally light. The rims measured 33mm deep and 22.5mm wide, which pushed our benchmark 25mm Continental GP4000S II tyre up to almost 28mm in width.
On a sunny day, the Rolfs are everything that you would want from a wheel upgrade (apart from being cheap); they’re snappy, light and taut feeling. The rim section isn’t the widest on paper, but it does produce a good tyre profile and isn’t particularly bothered by side winds. You don’t have that harsh riding feel like many old-school straight-sided vee rims either.

1735,"Sandy High teacher Audrey Stroh guided her students through algebraic equations on the second day of classes Aug. 25. She'd considered a more lucrative career as an actuary, but thought teaching would be more fulfilling.

At Oregon Trail Academy charter school in Boring, fifth-grade teacher William Krolik introduced his students to scientific inquiry. Krolik, also a first year teacher, said he wants his students glean big ideas and not just facts. First year teachers offer insight about pursuing education careers First year teachers Audrey Stroh and William Krolik talk about why they wanted to become educators. Some Oregon districts are reporting a shortage of candidates to fill teaching vacancies. Krolik and Stroh are both well-qualified, coveted hires, their supervisors say. And other Oregon education officials agree there are not enough teachers like them to go around.

Mirroring national trends, Oregon is in the midst of a teacher shortage that's sending districts hustling to fill vacancies, especially in areas such as math, science, special education, art, second language and substitute teaching. In some cases, districts have hired by the hundreds and are still planning for substitutes to cover vacancies as school starts.

Sandy High Principal Kim Ball felt lucky to fill her six openings by early summer. Applicant pools can decrease rapidly, often prompting a speedy hiring process, Ball said. Stroh went from first interview to signing a contract in four days.

""Every day is anxiety,"" Ball said. ""Will I get the perfect fit for my kids and my school? When you know you have somebody good, you will lose them if you don't move fast.""

State agencies don't have statewide figures on vacancies but numbers from the districts and hiring fairs give an idea of the shortage.

Jim Buck, Oregon Professional Educators' Fair coordinator, said the Portland event sold out this year with 221 districts from Oregon and other states in attendance. About half as many candidates participated compared to 2008 but teaching needs increased, he said. In 2013, about 40 attending agencies were hiring math teachers compared to about 155 this year, he said. And the number of districts looking for PE teachers ballooned from six to 51 for those same years.

Buck said districts have moved away from a uniform hiring platform to post job openings, which makes it hard to gather data. One online site showed that almost 200 Oregon teaching jobs have been posted since Aug. 3, which Buck said is unusual to see so late in the summer.

The shortage isn't just in Oregon. California had more than 21,000 open teaching positions, National Public Radio reported last month. One Nevada district has launched a nationwide campaign offering hiring bonuses.

Reynolds Sept. 10 David Douglas source: Amy Wang/staff The shortage is in part the product of a recovering economy combined with fewer new teacher candidates, according to school human resource representatives and state officials.

Oregon schools cut 3,600 teaching jobs, or 12 percent of the teacher workforce, from 2009 to 2012. Now, as state school funding rebounds, schools can hire more teachers to lower class sizes, restore and expand programs and cover Oregon's move to full-day kindergarten. But, teacher preparation programs aren't turning out enough new teachers to keep up with retirements and added positions.

Nationwide the number of new teaching candidates dropped 20 percent from 2009 to 2013, according to federal data.

In Oregon, the number of teaching program graduates has dropped by more than 830 since 2007-2008, according to data from the Teacher Standards and Practices Commission. Oregon Department of Education data shows that about 7 percent of Oregon's 29,420 teachers last school year were new to the profession.

Some of Oregon's largest programs specifically noted major drops. For example, Western Oregon University went from about 197 graduates to approximately 152 over a seven-year span, according to data. And Portland State University teaching programs saw a 15 percent decrease before reporting an upswing last year, according to Graduate School of Education Dean Randy Hitz.

Portland Public Schools listed some tough-to-fill jobs, like for Spanish and math programs, back in November, like for Spanish and math programs, said Sean Murray, the district's human resources chief. As of Monday the district had hired about 330 teachers and brought in 28 subs to fill vacancies. 

Other districts are reporting similar situations and a fluid hiring period. Hillsboro School District had hired about 150 teachers and had about 30 vacancies as of Aug. 19. According to data from Monday, Beaverton School District hired nearly 400 teachers and has 23 vacancies and North Clackamas hired nearly 160 educators and whittled the vacancy list down to about four positions.

The shortage has prompted districts to get creative about recruitment with some encouraging their own students or current staff to consider teaching.

Western Oregon has joined with a few districts to provide scholarships to bilingual students interested in becoming educators and returning to teach in their home districts, said College of Education Dean Mark Girod. Forty-three freshmen are enrolled in the program this fall.

John Beight, executive director of human resources for Salem-Keizer Public Schools, said the district is helping current staff to pursue special education endorsements or licenses. As of Monday Salem-Keizer had about 80 vacancies left for licensed positions after hiring about 590 staff for this school year, Beight said. He hoped to get the list down to 50 by the time school starts Sept. 8.

""Just because there's a shortage today doesn't mean that in six weeks a bunch of people can go be teachers,"" Beight said. ""It takes time for the system to catch up to the demand.""

Back in Stroh's math class, sophomore Oliver Jacobson focused on copying down notes projected on the white board. Stroh may not have as much experience as well-seasoned teachers, the student said, but it's helpful to have younger teachers, too. 

""They understand us better,"" he said. ""They know how we think.""

They are the lucky ones, the ones who make it to Europe alive. 
 
Photos of the body of a 3-year-old Syrian boy who washed ashore in Turkey have become the haunting symbol of the dangers, and of the miseries, endured by the hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants from North Africa and the Middle East. 
 
Reports say the boy and his 5-year-old brother were among 12 refugees who died while trying to reach Greece. 
 
Other reports say Canadian authorities told the boy’s family in June that they could not enter the country. 
 
The International Organization for Migration estimates that more than 2,600 refugees and migrants have died this year trying to cross the Mediterranean sea to get to Greece and Italy. 
 
Thousands of weary refugees and migrants keep hoping to get on trains and buses out of Budapest, Hungary. But government officials and red tape won’t let them move on to other European Union countries like Germany, which expects to take in about 800,000 before the end of the year. 
 
""The moral, human thing is to make clear: don't come,” said Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban. “Why you have to go from Turkey to Europe? Turkey is a safe country. Stay there. It's risky to come."" 
 
The human cost of the migrant crisis can also be seen in a lost generation of children.

And it’s not just fellow celebs who catch Witherspoon’s eye. “There’s a mom in my school who’s incredibly stylish. My friend Marlien Rentmeester, she has a blog called Le Catch.

It’s fun to see them mention Draper James.”

Speaking of Witherspoon’s successful clothing line, it was the star’s grandmother Dorothea Draper (along with her grandfather, Williams James) who not only supplied the name, but also the overall vibe of the preppy, colorful collection. 
 
“She was just sort of this quintessential Southern lady,” Witherspoon explains. “She didn’t leave the house without feeling somewhat put together. That doesn’t mean she was dressed to the nines at all moments, but she pulled herself together and her presentation to the world was like, ‘I’ve got my stuff together.’ But it’s a good lesson as a young person: It doesn’t matter what’s going on in your life, but you’ve got to show your best self to the world.” 
 

 
But her grandmother isn’t the only person to teach Witherspoon the importance of dressing up. Her famous Legally Blonde alter ego also shared a similar style mindset. “When you look good, you feel good,” the actress says. “I know that’s what Elle Woods says, but it’s true! When you look good, you feel good.”

329,"For Immigrants – And All of Us – A Time to Fight 
by  Bernard Weisberger 
 

 
It has so far annoyed but not really surprised me that Donald Trump, despite being an obnoxious bully, has defied expectations with a steady rise in the public opinion polls. It may be that his buffoonery and megalomania are simply more attractive to some early voters than rival candidates, with their solemn professions that what pushes them into the grind of campaigning is their dedication to promoting the public welfare. 
 
But I am considerably more than annoyed when Trump puts himself at the head of the armies of the new nativism by using his bullhorn to echo the warnings of the movement’s Cassandras against the supposed “hordes” of undocumented immigrants pouring through our “open southern border.” His point of attack is the so-called “anchor babies” — children of pregnant mothers who supposedly sneak into the United States so that their children will be born here and automatically become citizens. 
 
The hidden, malodorous and unproven subtext is that these children, entitled to the privileges of citizenship, will open the gates to legalizing the entry of family members, swarms of whom will qualify for welfare state entitlement programs, so that they may live in happy idleness at the expense of ¨real” American taxpayers. None of these suppositions has yet been proven by any serious evidence. 
 
So thus far, disgusting enough. But when Trump dipped into the gutter to add to this repertory of lies and half truths one of the oldest and rankest — namely that Mexico was emptying its prisons and asylums to let rapists and thieves run free on our streets (a charge eagerly snapped up by the likes of O’Reilly and Limbaugh , and left unchallenged by many of Trump’s rivals for the nomination) – I boiled over. That’s crossing the line that separates debate from shameless indecency. 
 
I am a historian of the United States and have heard it all before, sometimes almost verbatim and no less gross. Our works of history rightly celebrate our role as a land of asylum and opportunity for people from almost everywhere on the globe. It’s a pillar of our cherished self-image as exceptional among nations. But they often overlook or minimize the contrasting truth that there was always stiff resistance to that hospitality. 
 
Listen to this: “America has become the sewer into which the pollutions of European jails are emptied.” Substitute “Mexican” or “Latin American” for “European” and it could be straight out of Trump’s latest eruption. But it’s from a newspaper published in the 1850s by supporters of an anti-Catholic and foreigner-hating movement that began as a secret society whose members were ordered, when asked nosy questions, to say: “I know nothing.” Eventually, the “Know-Nothings” emerged into the open and organized themselves into a political organization that campaigned in 1854 as “the American Party.” 
 
In that first off-year foray, the new entry won a number of state and local offices and some seats in both House and Senate. The basic glue that held Know-Nothing-ism together was hatred of the alien (especially the Irish). The slither of the Know Nothings into the American Party was a way of “protecting” America from the Pope’s minions and other evil foreign influences. Happily, 1854 was only a flash in the pan. When the party ran a national ticket headed by so respectable a figure as ex-US President Millard Fillmore, they won only a single state, Maryland. 
 

 
A Know-Nothing cartoon depicting stereotypes about whiskey drinking Irish and beer drinking Germans as they steal the ballot box while Americans fight at the polls. 

 
By the time Abraham Lincoln ran for the Senate in 1858, two years before his presidential campaign, as many as half of the American people were the offspring of Europeans and could not trace their ancestry back to the stirring days of 1776. But if they looked at the Declaration of Independence, Lincoln said in a campaign speech in Chicago, they found the words “all men are created equal” became “the father of all moral principle in them, and they have a right to claim it as though they were blood of the blood, and flesh of the flesh of the men who wrote that Declaration, and so they are.” This self-evident truth of equal creation became the “electric cord that link[ed] the hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving men everywhere.” To be American was not about ancestry but to commit oneself heart and soul to the ideal of equality. 
 
A few years later, Lincoln was dead along with some 600,000 casualties of the Civil War, and a radical Republican Congress oversaw writing the Union’s victory into the Constitution via the Fourteenth Amendment. Its opening clause proclaimed, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” That flipped the prewar position, in which state citizenship was necessary to become a United States citizen, leaving room for states to refuse citizenship to “undesirables” like Negroes and foreigners. Now, no state could deny its born or naturalized resident citizens “the equal protection of its laws” or the guarantees of the Bill of Rights. 
 
The Fourteenth Amendment clearly intended to make sure that the newly freed ex-slaves would have their full civil rights, though it would take a Fifteenth to specify that voting was included. The inclusion of children born in the United States to recent immigrants was almost incidental. That is the “error” that the enemies of birthright citizenship aim to correct. They argue that almost no other nations outside the Western hemisphere show such foolish generosity. Somehow, this is one issue on which they are willing to forget or forgo our proud exceptionalism. 
 
Meanwhile, American ports began receiving the first waves of an enormous and transformative mass migration — some 31 million between 1860 and 1930. They represented a “new” immigration: Chinese, Italians, Greeks, Poles, Russians, Syrians, Slovaks, Serbs, Armenians. To many so-called “old stock” Americans, millions of these newcomers were dangerous and unworthy, and to the members of an Immigration Restriction League – which included in its number many of “the best people” of New England – the immigrants were of the “wrong” religions and nationalities. Poet Thomas Bailey Aldrich explained that through our “unguarded gates” pressed, 
 
… a wild motley throng 
Men from the Volga and the Tartar Steppes… 
Flying the Old World’s poverty and scorn; 
These bringing with them unknown gods and rites 
Those, tiger passions, here to stretch their claws. 
 
The same old charges were recycled — newcomers threatened the jobs of Americans; they swelled the statistics of crime, violence and dependency; they clung stubbornly to their religions, customs and languages and could neither absorb nor understand the values of genuine Americans.

A poster from the 1890s on the topic of barring Chinese immigrants from America.[/caption]Eventually, the gates began to swing shut on unrestricted immigration. There was denial of entry to those convicted of crimes in their home countries — which might include rebellion against tyrannical regimes. Then, rejection for those harboring contagious diseases. A third barrier, literacy tests, never quite made it into law but in 1921 and 1924, laws were enacted that set overall limits on immigration, divided by “national origins” quotas that favored the descendants of pre-1860 immigrants, while sharply narrowing openings for the children and grandchildren of those who had come later. Asians were barred completely. 
 
But those who squeezed through narrowed gates did what immigrants have always done when given a chance — assimilated the American values of the time, grabbed educational opportunities provided by the public school system, and by the millions took out the naturalization papers that gave them the ultimate step in acceptance — participating in democracy on an equal footing with the snootiest Mayflower descendant. So armed, they entered American politics and, over time, changed it for the better. 
 
A three-decade period of liberalism following the Depression, World War II and the assumption of an American global presence resulted in a 1965 change to the laws that replaced national origins quotas with others based on family reunification, specially needed skills, and refugee status. They erased the barrier to Asians altogether, setting off a new and continuing wave of immigration, still in progress. 
 
But none of this will continue if the likes of Trump and his allies can help it. The children of that slandered “new” immigration helped to build our cities and dedicated their working lives in mines, mills and factories to make us a mighty industrial power. They fought and died in our wars. But for some “real Americans” that hasn’t been enough. So here we are again, in a period of reaction, staring into the ugly face of nativism. 
 
The Know Nothing / American Party flag 
 
Trump’s announced intention to deport 11 million “illegals” while building a wall from the Pacific to the Gulf of Mexico at no cost — details conveniently not provided — is simultaneously savage and ludicrous. Yet what troubles me deeply is the possibility of this kind of cesspool politics finding wider acceptance, or being ignored apathetically by large numbers of Americans. Even more disturbing is the sluggishness of the response from Republican and Democratic opinion makers. Where is the outrage? Why is the counterattack left largely to Hispanic organizations? Why isn’t every decent media outlet shouting a few, simple home truths over the bullhorns of those insisting on their xenophobic lies? Such truths as these: 
 The “illegals” are not indolent. For years now they have been picking our crops, nursing our elderly, cleaning our homes and babysitting our children. They are not freeloaders. That honor should be reserved for people like rancher Cliven Bundy who grazes his cattle on federally owned land but refuses to pay federal fees and taxes.  They do not take jobs from Americans. Their bottom-of-the-ladder, low-wage service jobs don’t pay enough to attract American workers, white or black. Probably as many or more job losses are caused by employers moving operations abroad — or automation, which is a generic problem for all of today’s workers.  They are not “takers.” They contribute positively to the economy through sales and excise taxes, and cannot claim Social Security, Medicare or other benefits because it would reveal their undocumented status — which makes them vulnerable to threats and exploitation by their bosses.  Their crime rates are comparable to those of the general population, allowing for differences in income and living conditions.  
It’s true that completely unregulated immigration may no longer be feasible. But the movement of people from poor and turbulent nations to wealthy, stable and reasonably free ones is happening all over the world. Our governments must come together in trade and economic treaties that level the playing field by helping to enrich and empower poorer peoples. Trade pacts need to elevate the status of working men and women rather than maximize the profits of corporations promising that some of the swag will mysteriously trickle down to “the lower orders.” 
 
Until that miracle happens, no walls will keep desperate and courageous, motivated people from taking big risks to evade or scale them. Far better to provide our undocumented with reasonable and non-punitive paths to citizenship.

That can’t take place when truth is befogged by racist and hateful lies, which is the reason that every school should teach and every network newscast should repeat this essential reality: the story of our nation’s long practice of welcoming immigrants and opening a wide door to full rights is an American triumph, all the more so because it has been achieved over constant resistance and with many relapses and setbacks. 
 
Should Trump and associates ever get their way, the symbol of America would change from the Statue of Liberty with her uplifted torch lighting the path through the golden door to one of the Wall, complete with searchlights, guard towers, barbed wire and watchdogs. May it never be so.

2086,"Planning for a bypass road around Batemans Bay, from the Princes Highway to Surf Beach, began, perhaps, 30 years ago. 

PLANNING for a bypass road around Batemans Bay, from the Princes Highway to Surf Beach, began, perhaps, 30 years ago.

When the Batemans Bay bypass is eventually completed, traffic density in the Batemans Bay CBD is predicted to lessen significantly.

The problem is that no-one seems to be able to say when the bypass road (or spine road) will be completed, the state government being the current hold-up.

Surely the Minister for Transport can use some influence with RMS to sort out funding for this connection and make it a properly funded priority, and forget about the boundary change and amalgamation idea that will prove to be a financial liability on the shire’s

residents if it ever were to proceed.

12,"Official says 'small number' of Benghazi-related emails 

By 

Updated 09/25 2015 06:51PM

An email chain between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and then-commander of U.S. Central Command David Petraeus from January and February 2009 is raising questions about whether some of the emails on Clinton's private email server were mistakenly deemed personal and not included among the 55,000 pages of emails she turned over to the State Department. 

Separately on Friday, a State Department official said a ""small number"" of Benghazi-related emails that had not been disclosed to the House committee investigating the 2012 terror attack had been discovered. 

In the past few days, the State Department was contacted by the Department of Defense about the Clinton-Petraeus chain, two State Department officials said. The officials say the chain does not appear to include classified information, though an official determination has not been made. The chain included Clinton and Petraeus getting acquainted as well as some personnel matters, according to the officials. It was apparently considered personal by Clinton's team and therefore wasn't turned over to the State Department, the officials said. 

Most of the email chain was on an old email server Clinton says she no longer has access to, but the end of the email chain contained messages on the private server she used while in office, according to another official. The chain begins on January 10, 2009 and ends on Feb. 1, 2009 and contains less than 10 emails total between Clinton and Petraeus, the official said. 

State Department spokesman John Kirby said State received ""several copies of one email chain between former Secretary Clinton and then Commander of U.S. Central Command David Petraeus which were not previously in the possession of the Department"" from the Department of Defense and the State Inspector General. ""These emails are now in our possession and will be subject to Freedom of Information Act requests. Furthermore, we asked the IG to incorporate this matter into the review Secretary Kerry requested in March. We have also informed Congress of this matter."" 

Also on Friday, a State Department official also told CNN that in the process of turning over Libya-related emails to the Select Committee on Benghazi, it found a ""small number"" of Benghazi-related emails that had not been disclosed to the committee previously. These emails are among 925 Libya-related emails being turned over Friday and were found within the emails Clinton turned over to the State Department from her private server. The official said the emails were found because they have now been digitized and are easier to search. 

Clinton turned over to State her work-related emails from the server and kept emails she deemed personal. The email server has since been turned over to the FBI, where investigators have been able to recover both the personal and work-related emails. The FBI is looking into whether any classified materials were mishandled.",b5bd25f7-ad0d-4933-b91f-d6cc3883de73,News,2015-09-26T00:10:34Z,MyEastTex,New Hillary Clinton email chain discovered,0.0,Blog
2519,"Matching our deserts is such a fun way to enter into any party! In this second edition of our Cake & Cuts matching party series we are pairing miniature victory roll cakes (aka cinnamon rolls) with a victory roll hair style reminiscent of the 1940’s jubilee for classically fun fall style. Be the Betty of the brunch table with this simple match that boosts of golden hues and supreme style victory. First let’s start with the victory cinnamon rolls. These tasty little treats are one of my favorite sweets. I love cinnamon rolls because they are an acceptable form of birthday cake to eat everyday. Even for breakfast! A miniature version flecked with gold is a fabulous way to present sweets at any birthday, anniversary, shower, bakesale, or even a busy Monday morning. Victory Cinnamon Rolls To make these miniature victory rolls you will need: For the dough: 1 package (2-1/4 tsp) active dry yeast, 3/4 cup whole milk, warmed, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, 4 large eggs, 4-1/2 cups flour, plus more as needed, 1-1/2 tsp kosher salt, 6 tbsp unsalted butter, at room temperature, cut into chunks. For the caramel: 6 tbsp butter, melted, 1 cup firmly pack light brown sugar, 3 tbsp dark honey, pinch of salt, 1 cup coarsely chopped pecans. For the filling: 4 tbsp butter, at room temperature, 1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar, 1 tsp ground cinnamon. For the cream cheese icing: 2-1/2 oz cream cheese, softened, 3 tbsp milk, 1-1/2 cups powdered sugar, more if needed. Plus edible gold flakes. 1. Start by making the dough. In the bowl of a stand mixer, dissolve the yeast in the warm milk and let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. Add the granulated sugar, eggs, flour, and salt. Attach the dough hook and knead on low speed, adding a little more flour if needed, until all your ingredients come together. 2. Toss in the butter and continue to knead until the dough is smooth and springy, about 7 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl. 3. Form the dough into a ball, put it in the bowl, and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise at room temperature until it is doubled in size, 1-1/2 to 2 hours. 4. While the dough is rising butter the pans, using a cupcake pan will give you a perfect mini cinnamon roll. 5. Make the caramel by stirring together the melted butter, brown sugar, honey, salt, and pecans. Divide and spread the mixture in each pan.
6. Punch down the dough and dump onto a floured work surface. Cut the dough in half. Roll out each half into a rectangle about 10 by 15 inches. Position the rectangles vertically. 7. Fill the dough. Spread each rectangle with 2 tablespoons of the room temperature butter, then half of the brown sugar and half of the cinnamon. Take a pizza cutter or sharp knife and cut about 8 strips from each rectangle. 8. To make the center of each “victory roll” take one strip and starting at the end closest to you, loosely roll up the strip. Place the roll in the center of the pan. Coil two other strips around the center roll by joining the strip to the end of the previous one, until the cupcake pan is filled. 9. Cover the pans loosely with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm, draft-free spot until puffy, about 1 hour. 10. Preheat the oven to 350F. Bake until the victory rolls are golden brown, 12-18 minutes (watch for doneness sooner). 11. Let the cakes cool in the pans on a wire rack for 5 minutes. 12. While cakes are cooling, make the icing by whisking the cream cheese in a stand mixer until creamy. Add the milk and whisk until combined. Sift in the powdered sugar and whisk until smooth. Drizzle cream cheese icing over the top of each of the victory rolls adding small pieces of gold foil with tweezers as you go. Serve on golden plates and enjoy! Victory Roll Hair To make the matching victory roll hairstyle start with a clean head of wavy hair. 1. Take a 2 inch section from one side of the head (the best way to find a starting spot for this section is by lining it up with the outside eyebrow line). Back comb the section to add dramatic height to the hair. Spray 2. Take a smoothing comb and gently pull the section over the top front of the head smooth out the top while keeping the height underneath. 3. Use a curling iron to get a wide thick curl right at the end of this section and use a couple Bobbie pins to hold the curl into shape. Pair this fresh party look with pink lipstick for a nod to the perfect 40’s hostess in a completely modern way. Grab your sweet rolls and make a serious statement at brunch this week.

MANILA, Philippines - The Philippine military says unidentified gunmen have abducted two Canadians, a Norwegian resort manager and a Filipino woman from a southern Philippine island. 

Regional military spokesman Capt. Alberto Caber says two Japanese unsuccessfully tried to intervene before the gunmen escaped with their hostages aboard a motorized outrigger from Samal Island off Davao City. 

Caber says the gunmen appeared to have specifically targeted the victims when they entered the Holiday Oceanview Samal Resort late Monday on the northern tip of the island, about 975 kilometres southeast of Manila. 

He says authorities have no immediate suspects. 

In 2001, Abu Sayyaf militants tried to seize hostages from the Pearl Farm Beach Resort south of Oceanview during a ransom-kidnapping spree in the southern Philippines.

After having an argument with the security guy, who said I couldn't take my helmet as hand luggage, the rest of the hour and a half flight went without a hitch.

But once through the departure lounge had air con and free wifi, which we all took advantage of:





As we flew in over snow capped mountains, with blue sky Mr K and I had to pinch ourselves - we are finally here! 

Warm sun and blue greeted us. This is a dry heat much more manageable than Nepal's humidity.

Getting off the plane I was a bit breathless with a bit of buzzing in my ears - that's the altitude. Others felt their heart racing. A couple of puffs on my inhaler sorted me out.

As you can imagine passport control was a typically, well organised Chinese affair. But I did get talking to a very nice, official young man. He explained that today is a day of celebration - the first day of autumn and they celebrate with moon cakes. He disappeared and came back with a moon cake gift and a greeting written in Tibetan. I'm not sure what it says, but I hope our guide will translate.





The altitude takes a bit of getting used to. Tonight we have had a great Chinese meal. I'm in our room conserving my energy.... but Tony has gone off with the lads to explore and he has the wallet!!!!

Tomorrow we're off on the bikes heading to base camp.",43248eba-a02d-436f-8d37-4b79e3778149,Blog,2015-09-25T23:57:36Z,fionak18's Blog,Tibet!!,1.0,Blog

The United States is the best partner for Prime Minister Narendra Modi‘s “Make in India” campaign as the two nations seek to reinforce their strategic interests through commerce, a senior US government official said Tuesday. 

Under Secretary of Commerce Stefan Selig said that because the US produces “the best manufacturing exports” India will have “no better partner” in its bid to make the country “an elite manufacturing hub on the global stage.” Briefing reporters on the US-India Strategic and Commercial Dialogue (S&CD) to be held in Washington next week, he said the meeting “will examine how achieving our commercial goals can advance our mutually reinforcing strategic interests, including those under President Obama’s re balanced Asia and Prime Minister Modi’s Act East policy. 

” 

Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, will address the US-India Business Council’s (USIBC) 40th anniversary celebrations ahead of the dialogue next Monday in Washington. US Secretary Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker, Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Nirmala Sitharaman, Minister of State for Power, Coal and New and Renewable Energy Piyush Goyal, along with business leaders from both countries, will be among the participants in the dialogue.

Selig, whose portfolio is international trade, said the most important goal in India-US long-term collaboration is increasing five fold the annual bilateral trade from the current $100 billion to $500 billion. Stressing the role of the private sector, Selig said, “We are intensely committed to engaging directly with business leaders through our expanded US-India CEO Forum.” The forum which will precede the dialogue “will feed into the government-to-government discussions,” he added. It “will also ensure that business leaders play a central role in crafting policies. 

” 

The overall focus in this year’s dialogue, Selig said, will concentrate on four areas:

* Participating in strengthening India’s business climate to the benefit of both Indian and American businesses.

1107,"Liberal Andrew Hastie faces an increasingly tough fight to win this weekend's Canning byelection, with political experts suggesting he could be hurt by a federal leadership spill and a Labor source saying he was ""Tony Abbot's candidate"" Liberal Andrew Hastie faces an increasingly tough fight to win this weekend's Canning byelection, with political experts suggesting he could be hurt by a federal leadership spill and a Labor source saying he was ""Tony Abbott's candidate""

Federal Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Monday afternoon challenged Prime Minister Tony Abbott for leadership of the party, bringing to a head tensions over months of poor polling and internal division.

Notre Dame University expert Martin Drum said the Canning byelection was now wide open following Mr Turnbull's declaration that the Prime Minister was not ""capable of providing the economic leadership our nation needs"".

The Liberal Party holds Canning with a 11.8 per cent margin and many polls leading up to the September 19 byelection - triggered by the death of veteran MP Don Randall - were already predicting an eight to 10 per cent swing to Labor.

""You don't challenge because you think there is a chance of losing a byelection,"" Dr Drum said, disputing Mr Turnbull's suggestion Canning would now be more winnable.

""There are bigger issues here. You will have voters that go to the ballot of Saturday that are happy Tony Abbott is no longer leader or disgusted by the disloyalty by Turnbull.

""It could go either way, but there would be deep concerns among voters given the speculation over the last 24 hours.""

A source inside the Labor camp said scenarios in which the Liberal leadership changed to Malcolm Turnbull, Julie Bishop or Scott Morrison had been ""war-gamed extensively"".

""As for our chances, it's pretty messy for the Liberal party and these things never go smoothly, and they're never a one-day event, and there are always losers,"" the source said.

""Hastie was the Abbott-backed candidate.

""Hastie's views on many issues are in line with Abbott and not Turnbull's, so it's going to be interesting to see how Turnbull reacts to Hastie.""

Meanwhile, Dr Drum said Hastie was the one person within the Liberal party who certainly wouldn't be chuffed with the timing of the leadership spill.

Mr Hastie, who attended a seniors forum alongside Labor rival Matt Keogh on Monday morning, declined to comment when asked about the spill on Monday afternoon.

""The polls were predicting a 10 per cent swing to Labor, but Liberal voters who go to the polls this Saturday won't like the internal divisions - so there could be a backlash against the party,"" Dr Drum said.

""It just depends how messy the fallout is over the coming days.""

Murdoch University senior political lecturer Ian Cook said he still expected the Liberal party to win in Canning despite the leadership spill.

Dr Cook said Mr Turnbull was just setting himself to take the credit for the win.

""I think Turnbull is expecting to win Canning and will claim that a win was down to him taking over,"" he said.

""He must think the party is going to win so he's just positioning himself to say 'I turned that around' and 'I was the one that put us back on track'.

""I don't know why Turnbull didn't wait until after the byelection.""

Dr Cook said there were a lot of Liberal voters who did not like Abbott and might now return to the fold.

""It is hard to know how voters will react,"" he said.

""I guess some hate Abbott so much that they might go back to the Libs.

""But I expect that people will be more confused than see Turnbull as the new hope.""

Restaurant in Loggia de Vasari   The Strada del Vino Terre di Arezzo traverses the Valdarno, an area characterized by wonderful gentle rolling hills, medieval villages, hamlets, villas and castles. This extensive Chianti sub-zone covers some 675 hectares of vines and is home to 86 producers, over 15 communes. The Colli Aretini wines have a unique character, which is typified by a bright violet hue due to the slightly acid soils of the area. According to Carlo Ferrini, winemaker consultant to ""Tenuta Sette Ponti,"" the wines have more length than width, with good body, yet not as full and round as other classic Tuscan wine-making areas.   In recent years, the area has attracted big investors such as the Ferragamo fashion magnate, owner of ""Il Borro estate"" who favours a modern, polished bordolaise blend to the traditional Sangiovese. Antonio Moretti of Sette Ponti has recently channeled his dynamic energy from the world of fashion to producing some of the areas top 'crus' with his Crognolo 90% Sangiovese and Oreno a blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet and Merlot. Traditional quality wines can be found at the well-established estates of ""Tenuta San Fubiano"" with its classic Chianti Putto, ""Villa La Selva"" with its elegant Sangiovese, Felciaia and Petrolo's Sangiovese Il Torrione and fine bottling of Merlot, Galatrona. New emerging estate ""Mannucci Droandi,"" producing a good organic Chianti Colli Aretini, Campolucci, has done extensive research into the conservation of old vine varieties of the area, setting up an experimental vineyard for micro-vinification.
  Piazza Grande in Arezzo (Anguskirk/flickr)   Key players in the production of wine in the Colli Aretini areas are, certainly, ""Tenuta Sette Ponti,"" ""Fattoria di Petrolo,"" ""Villa La Selva,"" ""Fattoria di San Fabiano,"" ""Il Borro"" and ""Manucci Droandi.""   Wine in and around Arezzo come under the Chianti Colli Aretini DOC and DOCG and include the following denominations: Chianti DOCG, Chianti Colli Aretini DOCG, Colli d'Etruria Centrale DOC, Valdichiana DOC, Cortona DOC,Vinsanto del Chianti DOC e Vinsanto del Chianti dei Colli Aretini DOC. The charme and the beauty of the Colli Aretini (Ward Kadel-drXeNo/flickr)   Arezzo's typical regional food products and recipes Tuscan food is a triumph of nature: it is simple country cooking and it may lack a bit in imagination, but expresses an almost mystical symbiosis between a people and their land. The elaborations exported to France by the Medici are long gone and mostly forgotten. Also vanishing, sadly, are the inspired dishes that used to take cheerful Tuscan mamme all morning to create. But the basics are still there: country bread baked in wood-fired ovens and the emerald-green extra-vergine olive oil that combines so well in bruschetta and pane unto; exquisite vegetables and greens that make a minestrone easy (Tuscans have always been more resourceful with hearty thick soups than pasta); rosemary, garlic, onion, sage, basil, bay leaves, and tarragon that heighten flavour; and, of course, the bean, so adored that when detractors couldn't think of anything worse they called Tuscans mangiafagioli (bean eaters).   Tuscans are big meat eaters and Tuscan food is greatly characterized by grilled or roasted meats: chicken, pork, duck, pigeon and Florence's legendary bistecca alla fiorentina (hefty slab of Chianina beef - a real one weighs about 1kg with bone and all). Boar and game birds are also prized in this most wooded Italian region. Some of Italy's tastiest Pecorino cheese comes from sheep grazed in the stark hills of Siena.   Some of Tuscany's most famous dishes and produce   Arezzo's food: ribollita (Jenn Vargas/flickr) Arista Pork loin: roasted pork, flavored with rosemary and garlic. La Chianina - Bistecca alla fiorentina: thick T-bone steak charred on the outside, pink inside, served with white beans. Cacciucco alla livornese: a piquant fish soup, served with garlic toast. Cinta Senese:  a special pig breed typical of Tuscany, and of the Siena region in particular, from which cured meats, as well as steaks roasts are derived.  Crostini di fegatini: breadcrusts with Tuscan style chicken-liver paté. Fagiolo zolfino: we mentioned Tuscany's love for beans and the fagionlo zolfino is one of the region's typical varieties, originary of the area around Terranuova Bracciolini.  Gramugia:  a traditional soup from the Lucca area, of very ancient origins. It mixes together onions, artichokes, fava beans, asparagus, and bacon. Panzanella: a hearty salad made with stale bread soaked with water and crumbled with chopped tomatoes, onions, basil, oil, and vinegar in a sort of salad. Pappardelle alla lepre:  flat wide tagliatelle with rich hare sauce. Pappardelle al cinghiale: flat wide tagliatelle with rich wild boar sauce and pecorino toscano.   Arezzo's food: pappardelle al cinghiale (Sampo Sikio/flickr) Pici:  home-made pasta, thicker than spaghetti, usually served with a rich meat sauce. Pollo del Valdarno:  Valdarno chickens are a special breed typical of the Arno Valley, renowed for the tenderness of their meat.

Teeth-Clenching Financial Times Lead to Worn Down Teeth, Jaw, Neck & Head Pains

OAK BROOK, Ill. 

According to Delta Dental Plans Association (DDPA), an increase in stress, such as that due to a tumultuous stock market, can cause teeth clenching and grinding, known as bruxism, a condition that can lead to worn down and broken teeth and jaw, neck and head pain. 

Other factors that can possibly cause teeth grinding, says DDPA, include: anxiety, stress, anger, frustration or tension – all feelings someone may experience when checking their 401k, retirement, or other investments lately. 

What are some symptoms of tooth clenching and grinding?

While DDPA doesn't offer financial advice, they do serve up some tips when it comes to your oral health. While it's important to kick the teeth-clenching habit, here are some things to ease the pain and damage to your teeth while breaking the cycle: 

More information on teeth-clenching causes and solutions can be found in Delta Dental's online oral health library.

486,"FinanceInvestments Foreign Investors Enabled to Own Shares in UAE’s National Telecommunication Company
August 20, 2015
Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter In an historic move, UAE Federal Law No. 01 of 1991 has been amended by Federal Decree by Law No. 03 of 2015, and new Articles of Association have been issued by the UAE Cabinet of Ministers. The amendments introduce momentous changes, including the possibility of foreign investors owning shares in Etisalat Group, while Etisalat’s legal name will change to Emirates Telecommunications Group Company PJSC, but will continue to be known as Etisalat Group.
These changes allow for legal persons, including institutions, in the United Arab Emirates, or UAE government agencies, or other legal persons, to own shares in Etisalat. Also, non-national individuals and entities may own up to 20 percent of Etisalat Group’s shares, subject to the approval of the Etisalat Group Board of Directors. However, restrictions in respect of voting rights shall be applied to the shares owned by non-nationals and such shares shall not hold any voting rights at Etisalat Group’s general assembly although holders of such shares may attend general assembly meetings.
Commenting on the changes, Eissa Al Suwaidi, Chairman, Etisalat Group, said, “The approval to allow institutional and foreign ownership of Etisalat Group’s equity will have a positive impact for both Etisalat Group’s shareholders and the Stock Exchange. It also sends out a strong signal that the UAE is open for business and will enhance Etisalat brand recognition around the world.”
In addition to ordinary shares, a “Special Share” will be issued to the Federal Government of the UAE (the “Special Shareholder”), pursuant to the approval of Etisalat Group’s Board of Directors. Etisalat Group will also be entitled to issue different classes of shares. Other than the issuance of the Special Share, Etisalat Group does not intend to issue any additional shares at this time.
Ahmad Julfar, Group Chief Executive Officer, Etisalat, added that the move will enable Etisalat to continue to invest in the innovative products and services which customers demand and are vital in the highly competitive global telecommunications sector.
“As a result, I am confident that Etisalat will go from strength to strength and continue delivering long-term value to our shareholders,” he said.
Some of the other material changes include the ability for Etisalat Group to establish a new operating company for the purpose of operating its telecommunications network business and providing telecommunication services in the UAE, subject to Special Shareholder approval, and establishing a share buyback programme at any time in accordance with the conditions and procedures set out in the relevant law and subject to the prior approval of the Emirates Securities and Commodities Authority.
In accordance with the new law, Etisalat Group will carry out the procedures required to implement and align its status with the provisions of the new law within one year from the date of its issue.

 Emmanuel Adebayor failed to report for camp ahead of Togo's 2017 African Cup of Nations qualifier against Djibouti and will as a result miss the clash. 
The Sparrowhawks face lowly Djibouti on Friday, having edged Liberia 2-1 in their opening Group A encounter. 

Adebayor has suffered with on and off the field problems over the past year and was unable to secure a move away from Tottenham Hotspur despite desperate attempts to leave the North London club. 

ADEBAYOR RULES HIMSELF OUT FOR REST OF THE YEAR

2259,"Accies get their season off the ground at Inverleith 
 

 
Playing all of 0.9 miles away from home, Edinburgh Accies ‘travelled’ to Stewart-Melville’s home ground at Inverleith for their third round match in the BT National League’s Division 1. Stew-Mel came into the match with two wins from two matches while Accies had suffered two losses. According to various sources, however, neither team had played particularly well in the run up to the match, so it was all eyes to the pitch as the referee blew to start the match. 
 
Initially, it looked like a poor start for the visitors as the wind took the kick off beyond Stew-Mel’s dead ball line, forcing a scrum restart from the centre. It was immediately apparent that the home side scrum was in for a long afternoon as they just managed to retain the ball. However, less than two minutes in, the Accies pack turned over the ball from a ruck and, exploiting a gap up the left, wing Neil Armstrong galloped in from 30+ metres for the try. Facundo Beltrami, then stepped up to score with the conversion and Accies were 7-0 ahead. 
 
For the next 20 minutes of the first half, play was fairly evenly distributed between the teams, with Stew-Mel possibly having the territorial advantage, but suffering a couple of turnovers in the process as the bigger Accies pack exerted a bit of dominance. But, ‘evenly distributed’ possession counted for little as Beltramino knocked over two penalties in the period of the match to stretch the visitors lead to 13-0. 
 
Despite the penalty count against Stew-Mel climbing, they did have their own chance at points with just about 10 minutes to play, but, the, usually reliable, boot of Nick McCashin failed, and his attempt just made it across the goal line. From the 22 restart the home side pressed for the next score, but had to settle for a, this time, successful penalty goal from McCashin with about five minutes of the half left. Accies then regained the restart ball and pushed the home side deep, pressure which was rewarded with a successful Beltramino penalty on 40 minutes, so the sides went in 16-3 at the break. 
 
Five minutes into the second half and McCashin pulled back three points for Stew-Mel with a finely struck penalty from distance to close the score up a touch to 16-6. 
 
By this time, the referee was losing patience with Stew-Mel’s penalty count and, with another ruck infringement in the home 22, sub, Neil Bowie, saw yellow and was off for 10 minutes. Accies saw their chance, but their own penalty count was increased by two as they were penalised in a ruck and then again following the penalty lineout. This put Stew-Mel deep in the visiting half, but a dropped ball handed possession back to Accies. 
 
They then used their extra man to great effect and, despite desperate defence from Stew-Mel, they scored their second try from a rolling maul off the top of a five metre lineout, Jamie Sole coming up with the ball. With another successful Beltramino kick, the score had now opened up to 23-6 with just over 20 minutes left to play. 
 
Just as in the first half, the home side found their feet and were easily the better side for the next 10 minutes or so. They came near to scoring down the right, but eventually crossed the line with a fine passing move which saw No. 14, Ross McCann forcing himself over near the left corner. With McCashin’s conversion just shaving the front of the posts, the score remained at 23-11. 
 
Almost chasing down a clearance from the restart saw Stew-Mel inside Accies 22 again, but some fine play had the visitors clear after a few neat moves and deep in the home half. A ruck on the right was badly dealt with by the Stew-Mel defence and Accies no. 6, Alistair Pollock had a virtually clear run in to the line – almost losing his shorts, but displaying a fine line in Edinburgh Accies branded underwear in the process! Once again, Beltramino was on song with his kicking and, with just enough time for the restart, the score was 30-11. 
 
And it was a restart that one Stew-Mel player soon wished had never happened. 
 
With Stew-Mel on the attack, the ball was lost forward and Accies set up to clear. With frustration mounting, one of the Stew-Mel players ‘got in the way’. He was then ‘moved on’ by Accies Swanepoel, but Matt Stevens from the home side saw red, picked up the Accies player and dumped him on his head. Needless to say, this initiated a, thankfully, brief mêlée and the whole thing ‘kicked off’ with players flying in from all angles. When the dust had settled, the referee had no option but to have Stevens literally see red as he carded him following a short conference with his assistant on the touch line. 
 
Accies then cleared the ball to touch to bring, what had been a fairly scrappy match, to a disappointing – for Stew-Mel – conclusion. 
 
Images from the match will appear here over the next few days. As Matt Stevens will, in all likelihood, be facing an SRU disciplinary hearing, images of the incident will be withheld.",0c8d5315-7fed-42ac-80c0-d24cebc45488,News,2015-09-13T12:23:27Z,The Edinburgh Reporter,"Rugby – Stewarts-Melville v Edinburgh Accies, BT National League, Div. 1",0.0,News

The 39-year-old actress stayed true to her Southern roots in a blue-and-white gingham-patterned gypsy top paired with dark skinny jeans. She styled the preppy outfit with a gray trilby hat, a pair of gray-framed sunglasses, brown platform wedges, hoop earrings, and a Draper James “Hello, Sugar” canvas tote. Her blonde locks worn down around her shoulders and her barely there makeup completed her daytime-chic look this summer.

72,"I had my annual doctor's visit today. All is well and my OB/GYN was thrilled to hear that I'm on WW and attending meetings. She said something that really struck me. She said, ""We are all a work in progress, my dear."" So true. 
So that got me to thinking about September and the progress I want to see when the month comes to a close. In the past, that would have been easy. I would have picked some arbitrary ""lost this amount of weight"" number and set that as my goal. This time I around, I've learned. I need to find success and joy in more than the scale. I need to find it in new habits and my commitment to a way of life. That said, here are my commitments for September: 

1)  Stop stressing myself out on weigh-in days! I go to a Tuesday evening meeting after work. For weeks, I've struggled with trying to figure out how much I can eat and drink throughout the day so that it doesn't throw my weigh-in off. Do any of you struggle with this? This month, I'm going to focus on consistent days, not numbers on the scale. No more Tuesday stress. 

2) Enjoy the transition to fall by getting outside to exercise! I love fall. The sights, the smells, the activities, the return to comfy sweaters and other comfy clothes. I'm going to take in every moment and try to incorporate at least one outdoor workout into my weekly routine. Last night, my daughter and I walked three miles. It was her first day back to school and I spent the entire 45 minutes talking with her about her day, her friends, her life. It was priceless and I am definitely going to do it again soon! 

3) Finding joy in NSVs! I'm a big scale watcher. I weigh myself twice a day and I've always used that number as my ""go to"" measure of success. This month, I'm going to focus on other things. Did I track all week (and I mean EVERY bite)? Do these pants fit better? Can I walk further/stay on the elliptical longer without feeling so tired? The scale will drop if I keep working hard. It won't be on my timeline maybe, but that's okay as long as I'm seeing progress. 

So, here's to September and making it a great time to shape up and slim down!",297ab5ed-c4e4-4ad6-b38c-4d9c6c4e20a8,News,2015-09-01T18:03:58Z,Weight Watchers,September Shape Up!,0.0,Blog

326,"In a new expansion of commercial efforts to launch earthlings into space, Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos plans to build rockets on Florida's Space Coast — in an area he calls ""a gateway to humankind's greatest adventures."" 

Speaking at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Bezos outlined a new chapter for Blue Origin , the private aerospace company he founded more than a decade ago. He also described how he caught ""the space bug"" by watching Saturn V rockets launch from the cape's famed launch site. 

Those launch pads have been dormant for 10 years, Bezos said, adding that it's ""too long — we can't wait to fix that,"" in a comment that drew applause from the crowd. 

Blue Origin will work toward putting people into orbit around the Earth from Cape Canaveral, relying on reusable orbital launchers that will be built in Florida. The American-made BE-4 rocket engines that Blue Origin plans to use will also be tested at the facility. 

At today's event, the billionaire Bezos was accompanied by Gov. Rick Scott and Sen. Bill Nelson — who flew into space aboard the space shuttle in the 1980s — along with other officials and guest speakers. 

By committing to base its operations in Florida, Blue Origin will create 330 jobs and add more than $200 million into the local economy, Scott said. More than 10 other states had been competing to become the site of the Blue Origin expansion, officials said Tuesday. 

Bezos did not discuss when the first launches might take place. Blue Origin recently said that it hopes to qualify the engine for flight in 2017, with the first flight of the Vulcan rocket system planned for two years later. 

The company says that testing of the BE-4 engine has been underway ""for more than three years and testing of the BE-4 components is ongoing at Blue Origin's test facilities in West Texas."" 

In April, Blue Origin carried out the first test flight of its reusable New Shepard space vehicle at its Texas facility.",c603c0dc-c0fb-4b8a-8963-eafa31069a36,News,2015-09-15T15:04:00Z,Wyoming Public Media,"Amazon's Bezos Announces Plan To Build, Launch Rockets From Florida",0.0,News
348,"LILLE, France (Reuters) – The Czech Republic pulled off the biggest upset of the European basketball championship after mauling Croatia 80-59 to reach the quarter-finals of the 24-nation tournament on Sunday. 
 
Their reward will be a last-eight meeting with rampant Serbia, who secured their own berth with a sixth straight win after beating Finland 94-81. 
 
Italy, 82-52 winners over Israel, take on Lithuania who ground out a dramatic 85-81 victory against fellow former Soviets Georgia. 
 
The other two quarter-final ties feature a heavyweight clash between Spain and Greece while holders and hosts France take on unheralded Latvia. 
 
The Croatians, who won their only international medal as an independent nation in the 1995 tournament when they finished third, failed to end a 20-year wait after they were picked apart by an aggressive Czech side. 
 
The defeat also means the Croatians will miss the 2016 Olympics, with the top two advancing automatically while the next five enter three intercontinental qualifying tournaments for an extra three berths. 
 
The Czechs blew away their rivals with former NBA forward Jan Vesely collecting 20 points and 13 rebounds, as Croatia committed a staggering 24 turnovers. 
 
The fiasco prompted coach Velimir Perasovic to step down straight after the buzzer. 
 
“I am to blame for this defeat and as far as I am concerned my mandate in the national team is over,” Perasovic told Croatian media. 
 
Finland held their own against Serbia for three quarters but last year’s world championship runners-up broke down their stubborn resistance in the final 10 minutes. 
 
Center Miroslav Raduljica poured a game-high 27 points for the Serbians, who pulled away in the final period with a flurry of three-pointers after spells of poor long-range shooting. 
 
“We were too anxious early on and you can’t win the game in the opening three minutes,” Serbia coach Aleksandar Djordjevic told reporters. 
 
“We can’t afford to repeat the mistakes we made against the Finns because the upcoming opponents will be stronger.” 
 
The Italians, aiming for their first title since 1999, dominated as a talent-packed outfit boasting several NBA names produced their best performance of the tournament. 
 
Playmaker Alessandro Gentile buried 27 points and shooting guard Marco Belinelli, who joined the Sacramento Kings from the San Antonio Spurs during the ongoing NBA break, added 14. 
 
Roared on by several thousand fans who made the trip from the Baltic, Lithuania overpowered Georgia on the back of 34 points and six rebounds by forward Jonas Maciulis.

I think he is probably a bit too 'street' for Bond. Is it a question of being suave? Yeah.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - China celebrated the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Tibet Autonomous Region on the roof of the world on Tuesday with a rallying cry against its exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. 
 
Yu Zhengsheng, in charge of religious groups and ethnic minorities and number four in the ruling Communist Party, stressed the official line that the Dalai Lama, who fled China in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Chinese rule, is a violent separatist. 
 
The Dalai Lama, who is based in India, says he is merely seeking greater autonomy for his Himalayan homeland. 
 
""People of all ethnicities are steadfastly engaged in a struggle against separatism, continuously thwarting the Dalai clique and foreign hostile forces' splittist and sabotage activities,"" Yu said in front of Lhasa's grand Potala Palace, once the home of the Dalai Lama and, flanked by mountains under a bright blue sky, the highest palace in the world. 
 
Yu, who led the central government's delegation to the region, spoke to officials, Tibetans dressed in ethnic costumes and students waving Chinese flags. 
 
A procession of gaudy floats celebrating the achievements of the Communist Party and others that showed famous Tibet landmarks such as the Potala Palace paraded down the street after the speeches. 
 
On Monday, Yu urged army, police and judicial staff in Tibet to be ready to ""fight a protracted battle against the clique of the 14th Dalai Lama"", state news agency Xinhua reported. 
 
State media used the anniversary to launch attacks on the Dalai Lama. 
 
The Global Times, a nationalist tabloid owned by the ruling Communist Party's official newspaper the People's Daily, called the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate a ""cheater"" and a ""cruel ruler in exile"". 
 
This year marks several sensitive anniversaries for the remote region that China has ruled with an iron fist since 1950, when Communist troops marched in and took control in what Beijing calls a ""peaceful liberation"". 
 
It also marked the 80th birthday of the Dalai Lama and the 20th anniversary of the disappearance of a young Tibetan who was chosen by the Dalai Lama as the second-highest figure in Tibetan Buddhism. 
 
On Sunday, a senior Chinese official said the young man, six years old when he disappeared, was ""living a normal life"". 
 
On Monday, rights group Free Tibet denounced the celebrations, saying they ""may be dressed up in 21st century PR but they belong in the era of Mao"", referring to the founder of modern China, Mao Zedong. 
 
Tibet remains under heavy security, with visits by foreign media tightly restricted, making an independent assessment of the situation difficult.

3006,"Is Brendan Rodgers in genuine trouble?  
Certainly in the eyes of Liverpool supporters, if not the owners, who resisted calls to sack the manager at the end of last season, overlooked the claims of an out-of-work Bundesliga winner and backed Rodgers with another overhaul of the playing staff plus his backroom team in the summer. Since 22 March, when Liverpool hosted Manchester United at Anfield with designs on qualifying for the Champions League at the expense of Louis van Gaal’s team, only to lose 2-1 and collectively nosedive, their record reads: played 18, won five, drawn five and lost eight. Those five victories have come against Newcastle , QPR, Stoke City and Bournemouth in the Premier League , and Blackburn Rovers in the FA Cup. By any stretch it is a record that invites pressure on a manager. At a club with Liverpool’s ambitions it is nowhere near good enough. 
 Are Liverpool’s ambitions unrealistic given the financial might of other Premier League clubs?  
No, and how can 18-times league champions and five-times European champions lose ambition? Much was made last season of Liverpool having the fifth-highest wage bill in the Premier League and how that provided an accurate gauge of “where we are at” – to quote Rodgers himself. Given how few teams have broken the wage bill/league position balance in the Premier League , it must be taken into consideration. Other investment figures, however, scream underachievement to Fenway Sports Group . Analysis by the Football Observatory in Switzerland published after the close of the last transfer windowlisted the most expensively assembled squads in Europe’s so-called‘Big Five’ leagues: Germany , Spain , Italy , England and France . Liverpool were seventh with their squad costing £251m. Barcelona were sixth with £287m (due in part to the £75m given to Liverpool for Luis Suárez) and Bayern Munich eighth on £246m. FSG has backed its transfer committee and manager but the return has been underwhelming; the cost of losing key players high. 
 Has Rodgers run out of ideas at Liverpool ?  
The Liverpool manager is not short of ideas. In fact he has tried various formations this season in an attempt to rediscover the “identity” he concedes has been lost. It was lost at the start of last season too. Ideas are not an issue for Rodgers. It is how far he and his team have departed from the principles that underpinned 2014’s title challenge that is a greater problem for the manager, although he would dispute that he has veered away from aggressive pressing, penetrating football ideals. Other, weightier concerns than a lack of ideas would be the high turnover of players that has fixed Liverpool into a transitional phase and left their manager appealing for time for a second consecutive season. There is also no escaping the brutal truth that, four seasons into his Anfield reign, Rodgers is not presiding over an outstanding squad, one that has lost its captain ( Steven Gerrard ), best player (Suárez) and brightest young talent ( Raheem Sterling ) in just over a year. Given he is not solely responsible for the construction of that squad, he is not solely to blame. 
 Can the manager turn it around?  
Last season’s mid-term recovery – when Liverpool embarked on a 13-game unbeaten run in the Premier League after losing 3-0 at Manchester United – demonstrates Rodgers can steer a recovery but it appears an onerous task at present. The most damning verdict of Liverpool’s 1-1 draw at home to Norwich City on Sunday arrived from the manager himself, when he admitted the anxiety that afflicted the team at Anfield upon his arrival from Swansea City in 2012 had returned. All that work, money and upheaval and Rodgers is back at square one. It may not sit comfortably after Sunday’s Premier League poor result but there was encouragement for Liverpool in their performance against Norwich compared with previous outings. Striker Danny Ings suited Rodgers’ system far better than the often isolated figure of Christian Benteke ; Daniel Sturridge’s menace will only increase with fitness; and the recalled defenders Mamadou Sakho and Alberto Moreno made assured returns to the starting lineup. 
 
There was also greater creativity, if not penetration, from a team who have failed to score more than one goal in 18 of the past 20 games. Small acorns and all that, but we are only six league games in. 
 How have the new signings bedded in?  
Not well enough to alleviate the pressure on their manager. Nathaniel Clyne has made a smooth transition from Southampton at right-back and young Joe Gomez was an unexpected bonus as a makeshift left-back in the opening games. Christian Benteke has shown flashes of talent but Liverpool’s approach at the start of the season has merely supported Tim Sherwood’s argument that the Belgium forward was not leaving Aston Villa for a team that played to his strengths. Ings has had little opportunity to impress but, as mentioned, seized it against Norwich ; £29m Roberto Firmino is yet to make an impact but requires time – as all do in fairness;and James Milner’s rapid elevation to the captaincy in the absence of the injured Jordan Henderson reflects Rodgers’ trust in the midfielder but also the lack of leaders available to the Liverpool manager before Milner’s arrival from Manchester City.

Datto , an innovative provider of comprehensive data backup, recovery and business continuity solutions, today announced that Apple co-founder, inventor, and philanthropist, Steve Wozniak will keynote DattoCon 2016 , which will take place June 20 to 22 in Nashville, Tennessee. DattoCon brings Managed Service Providers (MSPs), Value-Added Resellers (VARS), and IT business owners together for three days of sessions, technical training, best practices and networking opportunities designed to help Datto partners dramatically grow their businesses. 

Datto is dedicated to innovation and with that spirit in mind, the company tapped one of the world's leading thinkers, Steve Wozniak, for a session entitled ""iWoz: A Conversation with Steve Wozniak"" during DattoCon. As an Apple co-founder, Steve Wozniak is best known as the developer of the Apple I, one of the first personal computers and a catalyst for the launch of Apple. 
   
""DattoCon gets better every year, and in 2016 we will not only provide content that helps IT professionals get ahead in their careers, but also inspires,"" said Austin McChord, CEO of Datto. ""Steve Wozniak is an inspirational leader in the technology industry and attendees will undoubtedly benefit from Steve's wisdom.""

The net loss of national joint-stock company Naftogaz Ukrainy in 2015 will total UAH 6 billion due to subsidized prices of gas used for heating households, Board Chairman Andriy Kobolev has said. 
 
""If we take the average price of imported gas [in 2015], which is very optimistic, $250 per 1,000 cubic meters, the total loss of Naftogaz in 2015 would be UAH 6 billion,"" he said in the parliament on September 18. 
 
He said that the average price at which Naftogaz Ukrainy sells gas for the needs of households and heating providers to households is slightly more than UAH 3,000 (VAT not included). 
 
""Naftogaz could compensate UAH 6 billion from other sources to maintain the price of gas for households stipulated in resolutions of the NCER [the National Commission for Energy, Housing and Utilities Services Regulation ],"" he said. 
 
Kobolev said that in 2015, 12.8 billion cubic meters of gas produced in Ukraine will be allocated to households. All the other needs of households will be covered thanks to imported gas. 
 
He also said that not all the gas produced by public joint-stock company Ukrgazvydobuvannia goes to households, and that some gas is produced under agreements on joint operations with private companies. 
 
""We [have for] several times proposed that the parliament and lawmakers amend the law, then there would appear a possibility of giving gas made under joint production agreements to households. This would be a kind of re-privatization. If the decision is made, Naftogaz would make it with pleasure,"" he said. 
 
In turn, Ukrgazvydobuvannia Board Chairman Oleh Prokhorenko said that in 2015, the company could produce around 14.5 billion cubic meters of gas, including 1.2 billion cubic meters under joint production agreements, with 500 million cubic meters being required for the technical needs of the company and for the operation of gas booster stations. In 2014, around 2 billion cubic meters of gas was made under joint production agreements, he said.",5e2e9a45-ceaa-427b-847e-57dc9db4266c,News,2015-09-21T08:45:05Z,Interfax-Ukraine,Naftogaz's loss is UAH 6 bln in 2015 due to subsidized gas prices for housing – company head,0.0,News

Scotland should accept 1,000 people as a ""starting point"" for further help, the First Minister said.

She also criticised the UK Government, accusing it of ""struggling to show leadership in this refugee crisis"".

Ms Sturgeon said the crisis, sparked by h undreds of thousands fleeing from Syria to Europe, was the worst humanitarian disaster since the Second World War. 

People across the world have been shocked by images of desperate families seeking safety, with Ms Sturgeon admitting she had been reduced to tears by the picture of a drowned Syrian boy who was washed up on a Turkish beach. 

She said such images would "" haunt our consciences and reputation for many generations to come if we don't together and collectively act to help those in desperate need"". 

While she accepted a long-term solution to problems in Syria must be found, she argued: ""We cannot and we must not leave our fellow human beings to perish in the meantime.""

612,"“Mountains seem to answer an increasing imaginative need in the West. More and more people are discovering a desire for them, and a powerful solace in them. At bottom, mountains, like all wildernesses, challenge our complacent conviction – so easy to lapse into – that the world has been made for humans by humans. Most of us exist for most of the time in worlds which are humanly arranged, themed and controlled. One forgets that there are environments which do not respond to the flick of a switch or the twist of a dial, and which have their own rhythms and orders of existence. Mountains correct this amnesia. By speaking of greater forces than we can possibly invoke, and by confronting us with greater spans of time than we can possibly envisage, mountains refute our excessive trust in the man-made. They pose profound questions about our durability and the importance of our schemes. They induce, I suppose, a modesty in us.”  ― Robert Macfarlane 
  
Read More Daily Reports From The John Muir Trail 
  
We returned to the John Muir Trail by heading back over Kearsarge Pass after a resupply. We made it just in time to avoid the storm on the way out, and were heading back to the trail with nothing but dry skies in the forecast. From the Kearsarge Pass trailhead, the path leads downhill towards Bubbs Creek and Vidette Meadow. We got a really early start on this day and stumbled upon a buck sleeping just off of the trail. The landscape here is dominated by the beautiful East Vidette Peak. I would love to come back here someday soon and make the scramble up to the summit. 
 
East Vidette Peak 
 
After reaching the end of the downhill hiking, we reached a flat section that meandered through the forest. It quickly began to climb, and we found ourselves looking out onto the beautiful Upper Vidette Meadow. The tree cover diminished as we gained elevation when we reached the 10,000ft elevation sign. I was excited for the next seven miles that would take us to Forester Pass at 13,110ft. 
 
Entering the Meadow 
 
Onto The Water 
 
Our next point of interest was Center Basin Creek. It was a special moment to cross the creek, and look out onto a granite wonderland without the interruption of a forest. For the first time, I could see just how high we would be climbing in order to get to the pass. We had a number of switchbacks to climb, so I began the process I’ve come to love so much, putting one foot in front of the other. My footsteps had become the metronome for the song of my life. My breathing was in perfect harmony. 
 
Beginning to Climb 
 
Looking Back 
 
Green Life 
 
We continued climbing up the wall of talus with the pass in sight. I was amazed at how in tune my lungs were with the surrounding air. I knew the oxygen levels were low, but my legs and lungs didn’t seem to notice. I was hiking at a pace usually reserved for low elevation climbs. I truly had my trail legs now. 
 
The Pass In Sight 
 
Alpine Lake 
 
Before I knew it, we were standing on the border of Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks. The views were absolutely spectacular at Forester Pass. We took some time to enjoy the landscape, and struck up a conversation with a few other hikers. 
 
At The Pass 
 
Looking North 
 
We began the descent from Forester Pass and it hit me just how big this day was going to be. Our goal was to reach Guitar Lake to set ourselves up for an early morning summit of Mt. Whitney. We had already hiked close to 10 miles with 3600ft of elevation gain, and we still had 16 miles to go if we wanted to reach our planned destination. Motivation came easy, as my heart and mind were intoxicated with the beauty of the Sierra, the peace of the trail, and the adrenaline from crossing a high pass. 
 
Looking South 
 
On The Trail 
 
There were a number of beautiful lakes in view as we lost elevation and pressed onward. At the end of the downhill, we crossed a large creek and then began a winding uphill climb on the side of a hill. Towards the end of the uphill climb, the landscape started to resemble what I’ve come to know as Hollywood’s interpretation of a Martian landscape. I knew that meant we had made it to the Bighorn Plateau. It was here that I got my first glimpse of Mt. Whitney from the East. 
 
On The Plateau 
 
Views of Whitney 
 
After the plateau, the trail once again headed downhill, this time to the Wright Creek drainage. There was a lot of shade in this area, and the day was turning out to be a warm one. At this point, we were only a few miles away from hitting 20 on the day, and my feet were starting to let me know. I feel like I can hike uphill for an eternity, but downhills beat my legs and feet up in a way that always leaves me praying for a swift end to all descents. We took a break near the water and gave our legs a chance to rest before making the final ascent of the day towards Guitar Lake. 
 
Final Downhill 
 
The final stretch of hiking for this day was a rather pleasant one, as the trail was shaded, and paralleled a creek for quite some time. The trail really started to level out as we reached Timberline Lake, and it was at that point we knew we were very close. Julia and I were both moving pretty slow at this point, but knowing how close we were to the finish kept our spirits high. 
 
Timberline Lake 
 
Approaching Guitar Lake 
 
When we finally arrived at Guitar Lake, we were surprised by how many tents were in the area. We had read to expect a crowd, but this was something completely unlike anything we had seen on the trail thus far. Much like Thousand Island Lake, I had to go searching for a great tent site. I’ve learned in my years of hiking, that heading uphill onto rocky surfaces will get you away from most people. The key is finding a place to pitch. It worked like a charm again this time, as I was able to find a perfect spot that had no one around.  I had packed an extra days worth of food incase were didn’t make it to Guitar Lake in one day. For the first time on the JMT, I had a true feast. It was so nice to gorge on two days worth of food for dinner! 
 
Guitar Lake 
 
The only downside to camping at Guitar Lake was being hit by the realization that this would be my final night on the John Muir Trail. Much like the night before reaching Santiago when I walked the Camino, the excitement I held in my heart was bittersweet. After reaching Mt. Whitney, the journey would be over.

The original Top Gear team will be moving to Amazon Prime, but are currently working on their new show without May – who is busy doing ""other stuff"". 

Clarkson, 55,  confirmed that May, 52, has not yet joined him, Richard Hammond and producer Andy Wilman at work. 

Clarkson, who was sacked by the BBC earlier this year, tweeted: ""To be clear, May is busy with other stuff but Hammond, Wilman and I are extremely busy putting our new show together. 

""Much is already sorted. 

""Sorry about the lengthy absence from Twitter. These are very very very busy times. Fun though. 

:To be even more clear, filming starts in a couple of weeks. And yes, all of us will be involved."" 
 
The iconic trio will front a new show – which is currently without a name – for Internet retail giant Amazon. 

On Wednesday, May discussed the new show, rumoured to be called 'C**** in Cars'. 

He said: ""We haven't got a name. We haven't decided on the content ... any of that stuff. So, honestly, nothing, nothing has happened."" 

 WENN  
 SPLITTING UP: Clarkson, Hammond and May live in Sydney   
Amazon Prime is reported to be paying the Top Gear hosts £160million for the show.

The Stig himself delivered the petition to parliament — complete with a Top Gear style tank. 

The petition failed with Clarkson himself saying it never would have worked. 
    
James May and Richard Hammond were reportedly offered £1million a year to stay with Top Gear. 

But the pair stuck by their pal and quit.

744,"Private garden in Niagara-on-the-lake Landscape fabric. It is not a particularly pretty topic to begin with after a bit of a blogging break, but bear with me. I think this is a series of posts worth reading if you plan to create a courtyard or pathway. (Coming up shortly, I promise to have more inspirational posts, new projects and a book give away.) Not too long ago, I received a question from a reader by email: Hi,
I am writing, first of all, to say that I love your blog, ""Three Dogs in a Garden"". As an avid flower gardener, I am inspired by the ideas I see there.
I've noticed that you have pea gravel paths in your garden. I am thinking of doing that, as well, but I wonder about your method for clearing them of leaves that collect in autumn. It seems to me that a leaf blower would also blow the gravel and a rake would rake up the gravel with the leaves and other debris. Do you clear the paths by hand?....
Thanks again for your blog, and happy gardening to you.
Jean 
Zone 4b, Wisconsin
I replied to Jean's email telling her that I use a standard fan rake. No big secret there! I do however, make an effort to clean up the leaves almost as soon as they fall. Freshly fallen leaves are so light and dry they seem to float on the surface of the gravel. Once the leaves get wet in the rain, raking up gravel along with the leaves is much more difficult to avoid.
As I typed out my reply, I felt I needed to warn Jean of an even bigger concern if she was thinking of adding gravel paths: working with landscape cloth. So I wrote back, touching on a few key problems and promising her I'd do a post on the subject.
Private garden in Niagara-on-the-lake Fine Gravel Pathway at the Toronto Botanical Gardens Pea gravel courtyard and path in a private garden. Pea gravel pathways in a private garden I always loved the look of gravel pathways and courtyards. They seem very old-world and even a bit romantic to me.
So when I planned out my garden, a little over ten years ago now, I included gravel pathways that would give the large circular garden at the very back of the property the European look I so admired.
This type of pathway also appealed to me as an affordable alternative to more expensive hardscaping with bricks or stone.
On top of the pleasing aesthetics, gravel paths seemed like a very doable project: you simply lay down some landscape fabric and cover it over with gravel. Sounds easy enough, doesn't it?
As best as I knew, landscape cloth was what professionals used for such an undertaking. Its use as a weed deterrent in flowerbeds was also very familiar. Here in Ontario, landscape cloth is commonly used as a low maintenance method of keeping weeds at bay in the public gardens that skirt new housing developments.
Only a few weeks ago, I watched a Chelsea gold metal winning British garden designer named Adam Frost install a landscape membrane (the English version of ""cloth"" or ""fabric"") to suppress weeds in his own personal garden.
Watch a clip from BBC's Gardeners' World showcasing Adam Frost's gravel garden. Though this method seems like a great way to suppress weeds, I have found that it is actually fraught with problems. It appears to work initially, but the benefits are short-lived.
I even would go so far as to say I would never ever use landscape fabric in a flowerbed. 
And here's why:
• Even with regular raking, flowers and leaves are bound to fall onto the surface material (gravel, mulch, bark, etc.) and break down. That little bit of compost, added to the excellent drainage the landscape cloth provides, will actually work contrary to the originally intended purpose of suppressing weeds. 
Here you can see a good example of the debris that falls onto a pathway. • Moving or dividing perennials will be more work than it would be in a conventional flowerbed. You'll have to rake away the surface covering (mulch, gravel etc.) and attempt to dig out the plant whose root ball will have grown well beyond the size of the original hole you cut into the landscape fabric. 
Planting the new division involves more raking away the surface material, cutting a new hole, planting and finally raking back the surface material. Trust me, you are going to be cursing that darn landscape cloth!
• The landscape cloth will make it impossible to add nutrition like compost or manure that your plants may require.
• Beneficial insects and earthworms, which aerate the soil, will find the landscape cloth blocks their natural movements and will avoid the area.
Jean emailed me back sharing her own experience using landscape cloth in a flowerbed:
""....Two years ago, I first killed weeds in an area along my side yard by laying down cardboard. Then I put down a double layer of landscape fabric over that and covered it with several inches of medium-sized bark chips. Last year, it looked fine. This year I have weeds poking through. I assume that the cardboard disintegrated and that squirrels or chipmunks dug into the wood chips and created holes in the fabric.""
As Jean discovered the hard way, even the tiniest hole in your cloth is an open invitation for weeds. I have even found that weeds don't even need a hole. They will sometimes spread out there roots along the surface of the cloth and live quite happily.
Weeds in my garden growing on landscape cloth covered with pine mulch. The choice of pine mulch turned out to be a HUGE mistake. In an upcoming post, I will expand on my own experiences and express further concerns about any use of landscape cloth. 
Sadly, there aren't a lot of alternatives, so I'll touch on the various grade of cloth available, as well as share what I have found is the best way to work with this problematic material.",f5bf5548-d699-4d64-a238-d681872ec204,Blog,2015-09-06T19:47:00Z,Three Dogs in a Garden,My Troubles with Landscape Fabric: Part 1,1.0,News

1238,"HE SUFFERED one of the most well-publicised rugby injuries of all time, but Matt Hampson remains blissfully positive in the face of adversity. 
It's been year years since a scrum collapsed and Matt, 30, suffered life-changing injuries on the rugby pitch.  

At the time, Matt was a rugby player for one of the best teams in the UK: the Leicester Tigers. He was also an England under 18 squad member.  

Speaking about what he remembers of his accident, Matt told Express.co.uk: ""I don’t remember much of the accident itself. We had a tough training session, ahead of the Friday when we were due to play the Scots.  

""We went into live scrummaging. I remember hitting the scrum and the scrum collapsing, with me left at the bottom. I said 'I can’t breathe! I can’t breathe!' I was really worried, and realised couldn’t feel my arms and legs. After that I blacked out."" 

He added: ""I remember waking up in the ambulance and the paramedics were cutting my England shirt off me. The only thing I was thinking was, 'That’s my England shirt! Don’t damage that!' I drifted in and out of consciousness with really frightening dreams.  

""In between the dreams, I’d wake up in Stoke Mandeville Hospital ward, seeing my family standing around me."" 

Little did Matt know his England shirt being ripped open was about to be the last of his worries - when the scrum collapsed it dislocated his neck, severing his spinal cord.  

""Initially, it was difficult to come to terms with,"" he said. ""I had quite a few dark days. 

""Going from being a young, fit sportsman, to not being able to move from the neck down was tough.  

""The thing that was great for me was the support from my amazing family and friends. They didn’t treat me any differently to before – to them I was just the same old Matt."" 

Speaking about being in hospital, he added: ""You don’t think life is ever going to be the same again. Stoke Mandeville for me wasn’t a very pleasant place.  

""There were great people in there, who will be friends of mine for life; but some weren’t as great. 

""There was so much emotion going through my mind, but they didn’t explain what was happening to me. They made you feel like a lump of meat, not a normal person – whatever normal is.  

""I didn’t have much support at Stoke Mandeville. I couldn’t see the light at the end of the tunnel at times. It was tough."" 

This year marks a decade since the accident, which left Matt paralysed and a tetraplegic, dependent on a ventilator to breath.  

Showing incredible strength, tranquility and mental power, the former rugby star hasn't let his injuries consume him.  

In fact, if anything Matt is stronger than ever and opening a new centre in Melton Mowbray to inspire children and their families to continue fighting after suffering a catastrophic injury.  

But none of this would be as easy without his friends and former team mates helping him and giving their undying support.  

Matt explained: ""My old teammates are a still a massive part of my life, as well as of the Matt Hampson Foundation. They support me in everything I do.  

""One of my best mates, Matt Cornwall, who was England Under 21’s captain and is now team manager at Leicester Tigers, is a great guy and has constantly been a really positive influence.  

""Then there are guys like James Haskell, Ben Foden, Toby Flood and others who I was playing alongside, who are always there for me and stay in touch. Rugby’s a big family – you go to the same events and functions."" 

He added: ""Richard Cockerill once said to me that I’ll always be a Leicester Tiger, and that they will support me for the rest of my life. What a fantastic club to do that. I’m a life-member of the Tigers, and they help with everything I do, especially with the Foundation. It means a great deal to me."" 

Matt is now focusing all his efforts on the Get Busy Living Centre. He said: ""I think it will be a really important place for people to come and share positive experiences with their families. We have so many different beneficiaries; so many unique talents.  

""The Foundation can do amazing things with this new Centre, and it gives us a real focal-point."" 

He added: ""My attitude is that you need to live your life every day. You can’t sit still and wait to be helped. You need to live every day, and try to achieve something every day.  

""That’s how I feel. Like we say at the Foundation, we want to Get Busy Living. That’s the whole point of the Foundation – it’s about being proactive, to do something productive with your life.""",59ea49a6-a970-43e1-bae1-882b2d4efec1,News,2015-09-28T15:01:00Z,Daily Express,"'I was screaming ""I can't breathe!""'

1020,"CENTRE-BACK Jamal Fyfield is determined to keep his place in the Wrexham side. 
 

	Wrexham have kept clean sheets in their last two outings, with the Reds drawing 0-0 against Grimsby Town in midweek after beating 1-0 at Boreham Wood on Saturday. 
 

	In the absence of injured full-back Javan Vidal, Blaine Hudson has been recalled at centre-back alongside Fyfield with Manny Smith switching to the right of defence. 
 

	Hudson has performed well in the last four games and with plenty of defensive options available to manager Gary Mills, Fyfield, a solid performer himself this season, is not resting on his laurels. 
 

	""It just goes to show the strength of the squad,"" said Fyfield. ""Hudson had to be patient and wait for his chance but he has come in and kept two clean sheets, set-up up a goal and scored one as well. 
 

	""The competition for places is great for the team but we are always pushing each other as we are team-mates. 
 

	""On a personal note, overall in the 11 games I have played I have been happy with my form. 
 

	""There are always ways I can improve and I will sit down with the gaffer to see where I can be better."" 
 

	Vidal returned to training yesterday and is in contention for a return against Eastleigh. 
 

	“If he comes through, he will be available for selection,” said Mills. “I think the most important thing as a back four is a clean sheet.

1140,"ATHENS, Georgia (CNN) – Jeb Bush was scheduled to walk right up to a small stage and give brief remarks at a tailgate on Saturday, followed by photos with students before going to the Georgia vs. South Carolina game in Athens. 

But when the Republican presidential candidate ventured into the tailgate space here on campus, it took him 24 minutes to inch through a thick swarm of students and fans to get to the stage. 

The enthusiastic sea of mostly UGA supporters — armed in red Bulldogs swag and smart phones — crowded around Bush to get a look at the former Florida governor, but most importantly, to get a selfie. 

His staffers gently tried to usher him through the crowd, but his campaign was more than happy to let the candidate take as many photos as requested, knowing most of the pictures would end up on social media — thus, free advertising. 

“Just get ’em all on Facebook,” Bush said jokingly at one point. “Tweet ’em!” 

It’s common for Bush to talk and take photos with audience members at his events. And while he spent more than four hours at the Iowa State Fair last month, he had yet to experience a continuous stream of fanfare like he saw on Saturday, where he was given rock star treatment from the crushing mob of people for more than 70 minutes. 

His visit to Athens marked the first of three SEC football games that Bush will attend this fall, all part of an effort to court voters in the March 1 primary that will involve eight Southern states and deliver the nominating season’s first huge haul of delegates in one day. 

After he worked his way to the stage, he was met by Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, who endorsed Bush last month and introduced the candidate as someone who “stands for everything that the party needs to be espousing.” 

Bush, with signs behind him that tweaked his “Jeb!” campaign logo to look like the SEC logo, spoke for only three minutes. “I’m going to be very brief because I really like taking selfies,” he said to big cheers from the crowd. 

The candidate performed a condensed version of his stump speech, promising to grow the economy by 4.4% so that students can get jobs when they graduate and buy homes. “A conservative can win the presidency and then fix these things so that you all will have a chance to live a great life,” he said. 

Then it was back to selfies for another 50 minutes. 

Following his widely praised performance at the CNN debate on Wednesday, Bush hasn’t been as eager to bring up contrasts with his rival, Donald Trump, by name in his speeches as he has been in recent weeks. 

Still, Bush jumped at the chance to mock Trump at one point Saturday when a voter near him commented on Bush being “high energy.” The former governor whipped around to follow up: “Very high energy!” 

Friday night at an event in Michigan, Bush pounced on the latest controversy involving Trump and a supporter who argued at a rally this week that the president was a Muslim and questioned his status as an American. Bush defended Obama on Friday night, asserting that he was an American and a Christian. 

The initial incident, which Trump didn’t try to correct or denounce, renewed dialogue about tension in the United States between Muslims and non-Muslims. 

“I don’t think that there’s a problem with Muslims in America,” Bush told reporters Saturday. “I think there’s a problem with Islamic terrorism in the rest of the world and we need to confront that.” 

Bush added that “of course” Obama was born in the United States. Pressed on whether Trump should apologize for not calling out the questioner at his rally, Bush declined to weigh in further. 

“I’m not really, I’m here watching the football game. Donald Trump’s not really on my mind anymore,” he said. 

Though the two quarreled Wednesday night in the debate, they also high-fived each other toward the end. Bush said Saturday that he doesn’t hold any “personal animus” against Trump, but when asked whether Trump should still apologize to his wife for invoking her in the debate about immigration, Bush said: “Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.” 

This week, Bush also got some attention from younger voters after he admitted on the debate stage that he smoked marijuana four decades ago. “I’m sure that other people might have done it and may not want to say it in front of 25 million people,” he said, looking around at his rivals on stage. “My mom’s not happy that I just did.” 

Asked Saturday whether he had heard from his mother yet, Bush said he tried calling the former first lady this week but she wasn’t available. “Thankfully, she wasn’t there,” he said. “I think she’ll forgive me after 42 years, you think?” 

With a few crushed beer cans on the grass around him and the smell of alcohol in the air, it was clear that at least some of the enthusiasm at the boisterous tailgate was owed to normal game day libations. Only water was served at the event, but anyone was free to wander over and several came with drinks in tow. 

Bush politely advised a couple of young people to pace themselves.”Slow down there,” he said to one young woman who was keenly fascinated with a sticker on his shirt. “We haven’t even gotten to kickoff yet.” 

As for who the candidate was rooting for at the game, Bush said he was neutral, though he predicted Georgia would beat the Gamecocks. 

“I think Georgia’s going to win the SEC East,” he added, as he was taking photos with a few South Carolina fans. 

The Georgia fans quickly broke out into loud cheers: “Jeb for 2",d6880afb-7fcb-4576-9d17-cedd343677f9,News,2015-09-20T01:02:07Z,WXOK-AM,"Jeb Bush goes tailgating: Selfies, Trump, selfies, economy, selfies",0.0,Blog

Strategic and operating highlights Listening programme shaping new strategy Six priorities to build on our strengths and improve the customer shopping trip:

1. To be more competitive 

2. To serve customers better 

3. Find local solutions 

4. Develop popular and useful services 

5. To simplify and speed up the organisation 

6. To make the core supermarkets strong again Andrew Higginson, Chairman, said:

""David has very quickly formed a new team that combines the best of Morrisons home grown and external talent. I am also delighted that two new non-executive directors - Belinda Richards and Irwin Lee - have recently joined and strengthened the Board. They bring a wealth of experience, which will prove invaluable to Morrisons.

""During the first half, the team has made good progress in starting the turnaround journey. Whilst the management team need time to settle in, make the changes they see as important, and build trading momentum, I believe the team will deliver much improved profits and returns for shareholders.""

David Potts, Chief Executive, said:

""Since joining Morrisons, I have been struck by the passion and commitment of all our colleagues, and I want to thank them for their continued good work. Our colleagues have the key role in delivering an improved shopping trip for customers both in stores and online.

""Morrisons will be an organisation that listens. During the first half, the new Executive and leadership teams have been listening hard to colleagues, customers, suppliers and shareholders. They tell us there is a lot for us to do.

""The immediate priority is to deliver a better shopping trip to stabilise trading performance. Our six strategic priorities will then deliver improvement in the core supermarkets, where we have the greatest opportunity.

""It will be a long journey. We approach the challenge with energy, confidence and many strengths, particularly our strong balance sheet and cash flow, which enables investment in improving the customer shopping trip."" Customers and colleagues are beginning to notice improvements, but the turnaround will take time and require sustained investment in the proposition.

As previously guided, we expect underlying profit before tax will be higher in the second half of 2015/16 than the first.

Financial overview

Total turnover during the period was £8.1bn, down 5.1% year-on-year. Store turnover of £6.4bn, excluding fuel, was down by 1.1%, which comprised a LFL decrease of 2.7% (including a contribution of 1.0% from online) and 1.6% from new stores.

Fuel sales fell by 16.8% to £1.6bn, 

Q2 ex-fuel LFL was down 2.4%, a slight improvement on Q1 (-2.9%), with online contributing 1.0%. For Q2, Items per Basket was down 1.1% year-on-year, and LFL Number of Transactions down 2.6%.

Underlying operating profit, which excludes impairment and provision for onerous contracts and property disposal profits, was £163m, with operating margin down 67bps year-on-year to 2.0%.

Impairment and provision for onerous contracts was £87m, driven by changes in estimates to provisions made relating to stores in the new space pipeline. Property disposal profits were £96m. Operating profit, including impairment and provision for onerous contracts and property disposal profits, was £172m.

Our definition of underlying profit includes restructuring costs and new business development costs. Restructuring costs were £24m, primarily comprising head office restructuring (2014/15: £35m). This was part of the £30m-£40m 2015/16 restructuring costs we announced at the time of the first quarter trading update in May. New business development (NBD) losses for online and convenience were £30m (2014/15: £38m).

In addition, we are today announcing further restructuring and one-off costs, which will be incurred in the second half as we continue to reshape the business.

The proposed closure of 11 further stores will incur a restructuring cost of £20m, which will be included in underlying profit.

As announced yesterday, the sale of M local will result in a loss on disposal of around £30m. The intent to establish a new defined contribution pension scheme, which it is proposed will become the auto-enrolment scheme for colleagues in the future, will result in a charge of £35m. Both of these one-off costs will be excluded from our definition of underlying profit.

Net finance costs were £47m (2014/15: £49m). 

UPBT(1) was £117m (2014/15: £181m). Adding back the £24m one-off restructuring costs, UPBT was £141m (2014/15: £216m). Reported profit before tax, after £9m net profit on property, was £126m (2014/15: £239m).

Underlying basic EPS(1) reduced by 35% to 3.73p (2014/15: 5.74p), reflecting the decrease in UPBT.

Capital expenditure fell to £139m, from £257m for 2014/15, with cuts in all areas, in particular new store openings.

Free cash flow pre-dividend was £479m, which included a further £125m improvement in operating working capital and £181m of property disposal proceeds. Half way into our three year plan to generate £2bn of operating free cash flow by the end of 2016/17, we have achieved £1,264m.

Overall, post-dividend and pre-property disposal proceeds, Morrisons was again cash flow positive, generating £64m during the first half.

Group net debt fell - to £2,086m - from £2,340m at the end of 2014/15, and is down over £500m from the same time last year.

The proposed interim dividend is 1.50p.

We opened one new supermarket (26,000 square feet) and five M locals (14,000 square feet). As previously announced, we closed ten smaller supermarkets and 23 M locals. The impact was a reduction of 94,000 square feet in net new space.

Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) was 5.3%. 

Market update

The economic recovery has been sustained in recent months. A rise in consumer confidence, real wage growth, and higher disposable income are all potentially positive for food retailers. Fuel prices have fallen and are expected to remain low.

However, we have seen no change in shopping habits, with customers continuing to shop around for value and shopping more frequently. In addition, as we continue to lower prices, deflation has been a consistent recent feature of our LFL. Although some commentators predict the return of food price inflation, driven perhaps by higher global commodity prices, we expect deflation to continue as we keep investing in our proposition.

Strategy update

Morrisons has many strengths. It is a strong British business, with a reputation for fresh food, value-for-money, customer service, and the provenance provided by our unique vertical integration. Our colleagues are committed, passionate and highly skilled. The business is cash generative, with a strong balance sheet, a freehold property portfolio, a well-funded pension, falling debt and a well-invested manufacturing business.

However, sales, profitability and returns all need to improve. Our immediate priority is to deliver a better customer shopping trip to stabilise trading performance. We then need to rebuild.

We are defining our improvement programme by listening to key stakeholders - customers, colleagues, suppliers and shareholders - and this is shaping the development of our strategy. Today we are announcing six strategic priorities: These priorities will deliver an improvement in the shopping trip and a turnaround of the core supermarkets. It will take time, and some components are still being developed or carefully reviewed by the new leadership team. However, we are confident the strategy is right for all industry trading conditions.

The six priorities also provide the business with many opportunities. The cost base can be reshaped and we can improve all elements of the Morrisons shopping trip. Improving the operational levers - sales, margin and asset intensity - will drive profit and ROCE. Improving the capital levers - addressing underperforming assets and capital returns - will grow the dividend and further enhance EPS. Throughout the process, debt will continue to fall.

The financial foundations of our strategy are unchanged. As previously guided, our proposition investment will increase this year. We also still expect to generate £1bn of cost savings and £2bn of free cash flow in the three years to 2016/17.

Initial success will be measured through execution and outcome. Improving the shopping trip will mean more customers and more volume growth. Then, once the business is stabilised, we expect to improve LFL sales, rebuild profits and improve Return on Capital, while continuing to generate cash.

The six priorities

1. To be more competitive

Morrisons is a value-for-money brand and must always be competitive. We invested over £300m into the proposition last year and will invest more this year, with a further £181m already invested in the first half.

In March we cut the prices of key commodities and in June we did the same for everyday items. There will be more to come. We are working towards a simple, great value-for-money Morrisons price list that is right for our customers.

Being competitive is not just about price. We need to set out an offer that has real resonance with customers and organise the business to deliver this consistently. This means striking the right balance of price, coupons and promotions. As part of this process, we are currently reviewing our Match & More proposition.

In addition, we are providing much simpler and clearer in-store messaging for customers. In June, we re-set all in-store point-of-sale material. We further clarified and simplified our promotions, especially at front-of-store and on the key promotion ends. We now have fewer and more impactful promotions, with the typical display now carrying two or three of our very best deals at a simple price point.

2. To serve customers better

Morrisons has a reputation for good customer service. Our butchers, bakers, fishmongers and other skilled colleagues combine to make Morrisons different from other supermarkets. We are doing more to enhance that reputation. During the first half, we recruited 5,000 new in-store colleagues and re-scheduled the mix of hours to serve customers better at the busiest times of the week.

We have launched initiatives to remove wasted effort, improve on-shelf availability and ease pressure on the tills. For example, we have introduced express checkouts into all our stores. We are also currently replacing and upgrading the self-scan checkouts in all stores in time for Christmas, a programme of 40 stores per week.

We have listened to the preferences of our customers and will be re-laying Wine to a new look, by colour and country of origin throughout the next few weeks. In addition, all our Produce departments are currently being given a new look and feel. These are the first of many improvements to come. Customers are beginning to notice and our customer satisfaction scores have improved.

3. Find local solutions

Morrisons stores are generally well located, serving neighbourhoods and communities. We have an opportunity to improve our local customer offer store-by-store and make every square foot work harder to increase sales and profit.

We will tailor each store's offer to local tastes and demographics. A core offer will apply for each store, with managers given autonomy to flex outside the core to best suit local customers. The organisation will be largely central, but the execution local.

In addition, we are introducing programmes to be more active with local marketing and to better utilise our stores as centres of the local community.

4. Develop popular and useful services

We plan to further enhance Morrisons reputation for great customer service. We already have some very strong service areas - for example dry cleaning, where we are the second biggest in the UK, petrol stations, pharmacies, and popular cafés.

Plans are at an early stage, but we see several opportunities to provide third-party in-store or on-site services that will drive footfall to our stores. These will not require us to commit significant capital, but will generate income and enhance returns.

5. To simplify and speed up the organisation

Morrisons is at its best when it keeps things simple. We are delayering the business and building a culture based on speed and teamwork, so we can become more agile and responsive.

During the first half, we completed the in-store restructure and now have fewer management layers, allowing colleagues to focus more on serving customers better.

In addition, we have just completed a major consultation and restructuring at head office, which will result in the removal of 720 roles. The leadership team has reduced from 110 to 65 people. This smaller team will have greater responsibility and accountability for bigger areas of the business.

6. To make core supermarkets strong again

We aim to deliver our strengths in every store. We have nearly completed a programme to get all of the estate to a consistent standard, Back-to-Best, both inside and out. This will be done by the end of October.

We will accelerate the refit programme. We have over 200 stores that have not been brightened-up for over five years. Our new Fresh Look refit programme will upgrade the estate by the end of 2018/19.

All these improvements will be achieved within our existing capital expenditure expectations.

New leadership team

Key to delivering the strategy and six priorities will be a strong management team. We have made good progress during the first half and now have a leadership team comprising home grown talent and experienced industry professionals recruited from outside Morrisons.

We have almost completed the formation of a new Executive team, which oversees the day-to-day operations of the business. It will comprise seven people. Alongside David Potts (CEO) and Trevor Strain (CFO), are Darren Blackhurst (Commercial Director), Gary Mills (Retail Director), Clare Grainger (People Director) and Mark Amsden (Company Secretary and General Counsel). We are seeking to fill the one remaining vacancy, Customer Director. After 25 years' service, Martyn Jones (Corporate Services Director) will retire at the end of October.

Darren has extensive commercial experience. He joined Morrisons from B&Q, where he was Commercial Director. Previously he was Chief Executive of Matalan, and Chief Merchandising Officer of Asda 

Gary has more than 30 years' retail experience, with Stewarts Supermarkets in Northern Ireland and with Tesco in both Ireland and the UK. Gary's experience covers all areas of retail and all formats, including supermarkets and convenience.

Clare has nearly 25 years of experience in Human Resources and management, mostly in the retail sector with Morrisons and, before that, Asda. Most recently she has been Morrisons interim Group Retail Director and has been leading the business through a number of measures to improve the customer shopping trip. 

Outside the Executive team, we have also made some key internal and external appointments in Commercial, Operations, Property, and Human Resources. We continue to identify the talent required to improve capability and are confident we are developing a strong leadership team to deliver the turnaround. We remain pleased with the key customer metrics of our online business and are on track with our original plan. We are also considering the broader digital opportunity, and how we can grow our online proposition while achieving an attractive return on capital. Yesterday we announced the sale of 140 M local convenience stores for a consideration of c.£25m in cash. We expect to incur a loss on disposal of around £30m during the second half of 2015/16. Morrisons retains a guarantee on individual lease obligations, which could revert to Morrisons if the new business does not succeed. The residual contingent liability in this event is estimated at up to £20m.

Convenience remains an important growth channel, and we will continue to consider capital-light, returns-enhancing opportunities in the future.

Financial strategy and update

Capital allocation framework

Our capital allocation framework is unchanged. Our first priority is to invest to support the store estate and infrastructure, and reduce costs. Second, we will seek to maintain debt ratios that support our target of an investment grade credit rating. Third, we will invest in profitable growth opportunities. Fourth, we will pay dividends and; finally, any surplus capital will be returned to shareholders.

Optimise assets

We are continually reviewing the performance of our supermarket store portfolio. In addition to the ten stores closed earlier this year, we are today announcing the proposed closure of 11 further stores which do not cover their cost of capital. For 2014/15, sales of the 11 stores were £86m and they were slightly EBIT loss making. 

There will be a related one-off closure cost of £20m for the 11 stores during the second half of 2015/16.

We have opened one new store this year and do not plan to open any more during the remainder of 2015/16. In 2016/17, we expect the sales contribution from net new stores to be negative.

Shareholder returns

The 2015/16 total dividend will be not less than 5p per share, which the Board believes reflects the commitment to the capital allocation framework, while enabling cash flow flexibility to invest in delivering the turnaround. Beyond 2015/16, the dividend will be determined and communicated as appropriate by the Board.

£1bn cost savings

We achieved first half cost savings of £189m, bringing the total to £419m in 18 months. We continue to expect £1bn of cost savings in the three years to the end of 2016/17, but are reviewing the different opportunities and re-prioritising components.

The recently announced head office restructure and harmonisation of the pension schemes will have immediate benefits. We have also been developing some new in-store cost saving initiatives, many of which have been successful and are already being introduced. For example, improved planning and control initiatives in our in-store warehouses have enabled better visibility of stock flow.

We are not rolling-out sales based ordering (SBO) immediately. One of our key priorities is better on-shelf availability, through improved and streamlined in-store process and updated stock ordering technology. These changes will deliver many of the cost saving benefits of SBO without the time, capital, and disruption risks SBO roll-out could have brought.

Cash flow and working capital

Our free cash flow plans are progressing well, and we remain on-track to generate £2bn operating free cash flow in the three years to end-2016/17. This includes a target of £600m of operating working capital improvement. With £125m in the first half, we have now generated £331m of operating working capital 18 months into that plan.

Property disposals

Our £1bn three year property disposal plan is on-track with £629m achieved so far, including £181m during the first half. We remain committed to a freehold store portfolio of over 80%, and are currently at 85%. The focus is now on property development opportunities and non-core asset disposals. We expect a net annual rent impact towards the lower end of the previously guided £20m-£25m range.

Capital expenditure

We have reviewed our capital expenditure plans in detail. All components fell during the first half - new stores, non-core channels and IT. We still expect full year capital expenditure to be around £400m, as the Fresh Look refits start in the second half.

In future, we expect core supermarkets' capital expenditure to be sustainable at around £400m-£450m per annum. In addition, we now expect the previously announced 2015/16 £100m onerous contracts to be spread over the next two years, meaning £50m is now expected in 2015/16 and a total of £100m in 2016/17. Net debt has fallen by £254m since year-end, and we expect further progress in future. The half-year position of £2,086m is already within our 2015/16 year-end target range of £1.9bn-£2.1bn. We intend to launch a defined contribution scheme to sit alongside our Retirement Saver scheme. This will provide a lower cost option for our colleagues to save for retirement. Subject to consultation, we anticipate this will become the auto-enrolment scheme for colleagues in the future, and we expect to incur a related charge of £35m in the second half.

Commercial income

During the first half, commercial income was £179m (2014/15: £194m). Our definition comprises suppliers' marketing contributions and volume-based rebates, but excludes promotional funding as these are automatic deductions from costs and are triggered as units are sold with no subjectivity or judgement applied. We remain focussed on ROCE as an important KPI, and are committed to improving future returns.

2015 Long Term Incentive Plan awards

Once the performance targets for the 2015 Long Term Incentive Plan awards have been determined, they will be communicated to shareholders via a disclosure in the Investor Relations section of the Morrisons website.

Corporate responsibility and community

How we operate is very important to us. Our corporate responsibility programme ensures we work in a way that is right for our customers, colleagues, suppliers and communities, creating longer term sustainable growth. In June, we published our 2014/15 CR Review, which was independently verified by our assurance providers, DNV GL. It is available to download at www.morrisons-corporate.com/cr 

Shortlisted for Most Sustainable Retailer of the Year

We've been recognised for our responsible business programme at this year's Retail Industry Awards and have been shortlisted for Most Sustainable Retailer of the Year. This award is for retailers who can demonstrate their full commitment to driving change by improving the sustainability of their operations. 

Sustainable Fisheries - Ocean Disclosure Project

It is important that our customers know where our fish comes from and how it has been caught. We continue to work hard with our suppliers to ensure that all fish we stock is responsibly sourced, and to improve and certify all areas of our supply chain. 

We have taken part in the Ocean Disclosure Project and demonstrated our commitment to corporate transparency by publishing the full lists of fisheries we use for sourcing alongside data on sustainability. The initiative, conducted with the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership, represents a step forward in corporate reporting. 

Supporting National charity partner, Sue Ryder

Our customers and colleagues have so far raised a fantastic £3.2m for our partnership with Sue Ryder. We are working with the charity to help and support families throughout the UK. At the heart of the partnership is a shared belief that everyone should be able to get the care they want when they need it most, and that their families should be supported through the most difficult times. 

Morrisons partnership will enable the charity to establish community clinics, end-of-life-care online support communities, and family support teams. 

Reducing our carbon emissions

Our commitment to reduce operational carbon emissions by 30% by 2020, from a 2005 baseline remains a significant focus within our business. With five years of investment still to go, we have so far achieved a reduction of 23%. Earlier this year we introduced flexible benefits for colleagues - with the opportunity to sacrifice salary for childcare vouchers, cycle-to-work, laptops, tablets and mobile phones, plus a range of health and wellbeing options such as health assessments, dental and optical cover. 

We are committed to supporting our colleagues in playing an active part in their communities. Underlying profit before tax and underlying earnings per share include new business development and restructuring costs, but exclude profit/loss relating to property disposals and sale of businesses, IAS 19 pension interest, impairment and provision for onerous contracts.

The information received by the Executive Committee is consistent with that received by the previous Management Board. There are no differences from the 2014/15 Annual report and financial statements in the basis of segmentation. The Directors consider there to be one operating segment, that of retailing. The Executive Committee uses the underlying profit figure to measure performance. A reconciliation of underlying profit to the statutory position can be found in note 2. The Executive Committee also reviews a balance sheet containing assets and liabilities which is as shown within the Consolidated balance sheet. UNDERLYING EARNINGS The Directors consider that the underlying earnings and underlying adjusted earnings per share measures referred to in the results provide useful information for shareholders on underlying trends and performance. The adjustments are made to reported profit/loss to (a) remove impairment, provision for onerous contracts, or other similar items that do not relate to the Group's principal activities on an ongoing basis; (b) remove profit/loss arising on disposal and exit of properties and sale of businesses; (c) apply a normalised tax rate of 25.3% (3 August 2014: 26.0%, 1 February 2015: 26.1%); and (d) remove the impact of pension interest volatility. 26 weeks ended 26 weeks ended 52 weeks ended 2 August 2015 3 August 2014 1 February 2015 Note Profit/(loss) after tax Add back: tax charge/(credit) for the period 1 Profit/(loss) before tax Adjustments for: Impairment and provision for onerous contracts 1 Profit/loss arising on disposal and exit of properties 1 Profit on disposal of Kiddicare.com Limited 1 16 Net pension interest income1 Underlying profit before tax Normalised tax charge at 25.3%/26.0%/26.1% 1 Underlying profit after tax Adjustments marked 1 decrease post-tax underlying earnings by £20m (3 August 2014: decrease £49m, 1 February 2015: increase £1,016m), as shown in the reconciliation of earnings disclosed in note 6. Net profit on property is £9m. This includes profits arising on disposal of properties amounting to £96m. Following our continued review of the Group's store opening programme, this profit has been offset by an additional charge of £87m for changes in estimates related to the provisions for stores in the new space pipeline. In the period ended 1 February 2015, included within profit/loss arising on disposal and exit of properties is a charge of £19m relating to the closure of ten stores and six convenience stores. Impairment and provisions for onerous contracts in the period ended 1 February 2015 consists of £1,273m in relation to trading stores, of which £1,116m is impairment, £118m is onerous lease provisions, £30m relates to onerous commitments and £9m relating to lease premiums.

The normalised rate of tax of 25.3% (3 August 2014: 26.0%, 1 February 2015: 26.1%) has been calculated using full year projections and has been applied to the half year underlying profit. The standard rate of corporation tax of 20.2% (3 August 2014: 21.3%, 1 February 2015: 21.3%) for the year has been applied to the half year impairment and provision for onerous contracts charge, and the profit/loss on property related transactions, on an item by item basis. Legislation to reduce the standard rate of corporation tax from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 18% from 1 April 2020 was included in Summer Finance Bill 2015. The legislation was not substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Accordingly, deferred tax has been provided at 20%, being the rate substantively enacted by 2 August 2015, as required by IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings/(loss) per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period. For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares. Underlying EPS It is the Directors' view that underlying EPS is the fairest reflection of the underlying results of the business. 26 weeks ended 26 weeks ended 52 weeks ended 2 August 2015 3 August 2014 1 February 2015 Basic EPS Underlying EPS Basic earnings/(loss) Earnings/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders Underlying earnings Earnings/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders Adjustments to determine underlying profit (note 2) Underlying earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders Weighted average number of shares Ordinary shares in issue/diluted ordinary shares Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements 26 weeks ended 2 August 2015 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS 2 August 2015 3 August 2014 1 February 2015 Net book value At beginning of the period Interest capitalised At end of the period The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets principally consists of software development costs of £514m (3 August 2014: £477m, 1 February 2015: £495m).

The Morrison and Safeway Schemes provide pension benefits based on either the employee's compensation package or career average revalued earnings (CARE) (the 'CARE Schemes'). The Retirement Saver Plan ('RSP') is a cash balance scheme, which provides a lump sum benefit based upon a defined proportion of an employee's annual earnings, which is revalued each year in line with inflation. The movement in the net pension asset/(liability) during the period was as follows: 2 August 2015 3 August 2014 (unaudited) 1 February 2015 Net pension liability at start of the period Net interest income Curtailment gain Remeasurement in other comprehensive income Employer contributions Current service cost Administrative expenses Net pension asset/(liability) at the end of the period This is disclosed in the balance sheet as follows: 2 August 2015 Safeway CARE scheme Retirement Saver Plan Morrison CARE scheme Net pension asset at the end of the period Closure of CARE Schemes to future accrual In January 2015 the Group announced that it had reached an agreement in principle with the Trustees of the CARE Schemes to close them to future accrual, subject to the outcome of consultation with current scheme members. This consultation has concluded and an agreement has been reached, with changes effective from 5 July 2015. The financial effect of closing these schemes to future accrual is to reduce the Group's exposure to future volatility, increases in pension liabilities and cost. Subsequently, the Group has entered into an agreement in principle with the Trustees of the Scottish Limited Partnership. In addition to the £90m of properties contributed to the existing pension funding structure in 2012/13, the Group has provided an additional asset contribution of £150m. Under this agreement, the Group retains control of these additional properties unless the Group becomes insolvent. In the event of insolvency, these assets would form part of the Scheme assets.

The Directors are proposing an interim dividend of 1.50p per share which will be paid on 9 November 2015 to shareholders who are on the register of members on 2 October 2015. The interim dividend will absorb an estimated £35m of shareholders' funds. This amount will be charged to retained earnings when paid. DISPOSAL OF KIDDICARE.COM LIMITED In the prior year, the Group disposed of Kiddicare.com Limited to Endless LLP, receiving consideration of £2m for the sale of the shares. This resulted in a profit on disposal of £4m in the comparative period. This profit was one-off in nature and so was excluded from reported underlying profit. As at 2 August 2015, one out of the ten leases relating to Kiddicare remained unassigned. SHARE CAPITAL Trust shares Included in retained earnings is a deduction of £46,485 (3 August 2014: £5m, 1 February 2015: £6m) in respect of own shares held at the balance sheet date. This represents the cost of 21,722 (3 August 2014: 2,915,374, 1 February 2015: 2,907,374) of the Group's ordinary shares (nominal value of £2,172 (3 August 2014: £0.3m, 1 February 2015: £0.3m)). These shares are held in a trust and were acquired by the business to meet obligations under the Group's employee share plans using funds provided by the Group. The market value of the shares at 2 August 2015 was £39,643 (3 August 2014: £5m, 1 February 2015: £5m). The trust has waived its right to dividends. These shares are not treasury shares as defined by the London Stock Exchange. During the period the Group acquired 116,663 (3 August 2014: 4,000,000, 1 February 2015: 4,000,000) of its own shares to hold in trust for consideration of £0.2m (3 August 2014: £8m, 1 February 2015: £8m), and utilised 3,002,315 (3 August 2014: 3,023,234, 1 February 2015: 3,031,234) trust shares to satisfy awards under the Group's employee share plans. Issue of new shares The Group issued 35,119 (3 August 2014: 37,970, 1 February 2015: 41,962) new shares to satisfy options exercised by employees during the period. Proceeds received on exercise of these shares amounted to £0.1m (3 August 2014: £0.1m, 1 February 2015: £0.1m). Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements 26 weeks ended 2 August 2015 COMMERCIAL INCOME Commercial income remains an area of focus for the Group. This is an area which is currently not directly covered by accounting standards and there is no prescriptive disclosure best practice. The Financial Reporting Council ('FRC') has urged the Boards of retailers and suppliers to provide greater clarity in this area. Commercial income controls were disclosed within the Corporate Governance section of the 2014/15 Annual report and financial statements. The disclosure below is the first time the Group has made commercial income disclosures at the half year. The disclosure summarises the quantum earned in the income statement and the balance sheet position as at 2 August 2015. Commercial income is recognised as a deduction from cost of sales, based on expected entitlement that has been earned up to the balance sheet date for each relevant supplier contract. The Group only recognises commercial income where there is documented evidence of an agreement with an individual supplier. The types of commercial income recognised by the Group and the recognition policies are: Type of deduction Marketing and advertising funding Examples include income in respect of in-store marketing and point of sale, as well as funding for advertising. Income is recognised over the period as set out in the specific supplier agreement. Income is invoiced once the performance conditions in the supplier agreement have been achieved. Income earned by achieving volume or spend targets set by the supplier for specific products over specific periods. Income is recognised through the year based on forecasts for expected sales or purchase volumes, informed by current performance, trends, and the terms of the supplier agreement. Income is invoiced throughout the year in accordance with the specific supplier terms. In order to minimise any risk arising from estimation, supplier confirmations are also obtained to agree the final value to be recognised at year end, prior to it being invoiced. Commercial income earned in the period, by type of income, is summarised below: 26 weeks ended 2 August 2015 26 weeks ended 3 August 2014 52 weeks ended 1 February 2015 Commercial income: Marketing and advertising funding Volume-based rebates Total commercial income The following table summarises the uncollected commercial income at the balance sheet date at the end of each period: 2 August 2015 3 August 2014 1 February 2015 Commercial income trade debtor Accrued commercial income Commercial income due, offset against amounts owed As of 6 September 2015, £8m of the £12m commercial income trade debtor balance had been settled and £2m of the £30m accrued commercial income balance had been invoiced and settled. In addition, £31m of the £42m commercial income due had been offset against payments made. Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements 26 weeks ended 2 August 2015 POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS Disposal of Wm Morrison Convenience Stores Limited and associated M local assets Since the end of the period, on 9 September 2015, the Group has agreed the sale of its subsidiary Wm Morrison Convenience Stores Limited and associated M local assets to MLCG Limited for a cash consideration of c.£25m. The sale will result in an estimated loss on disposal of around £30m, which will be recognised in the second half. Following the sale, Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC continues to guarantee leases in respect of its former convenience stores. If a lessee were to default, their lease obligations could revert back to the Group under the terms of the guarantees and become a liability of the Group.

However, the auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has carried out a review of the condensed consolidated financial statements and their report is included in this Half-yearly financial report. The comparative financial information contained in the condensed consolidated financial statements in respect of the 52 weeks ended

5 has been extracted from the 2014/15 Annual report and financial statements.

The 2015/16 Half-yearly financial report was approved by the Board of Directors on 9 September 2015.

The Group remains able to borrow cash at competitive rates and the Group has negotiated, and has available to it, committed competitive facilities that will meet the Group's needs in the short and medium term.

What a review of condensed consolidated financial statements involves 

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410, 'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity' 

A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and, consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 

We have read the other information contained in the Half-yearly financial report and considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the condensed consolidated financial statements.

2560,"THE white man accused of killing nine black churchgoers during a Bible study will face the death penalty, according to court documents. THE documents filed on Thursday state prosecutors would pursue the death penalty against Dylann Roof, 21, because more than two people were killed, and that others' lives were put at risk.

Prosecutors also said they intended to present evidence on Roof's mental state, adult and juvenile criminal record and other conduct, as well as his apparent lack of remorse for the killings.

Roof faces state charges including nine murder counts in the June 17 slayings at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.

He is expected in court again on those charges in October.

He also faces federal charges including hate crimes and obstruction of the practice of religion, some of which are also eligible for the death penalty in that system.

US Attorney General Loretta Lynch has said federal charges were necessary to adequately address a motive that prosecutors believe was unquestionably rooted in racial hate.

South Carolina has no state hate crimes law.

Roof is white and appeared in photos waving Confederate flags and burning or desecrating US flags.

He purportedly wrote online of fomenting racial violence, and federal authorities have said he used a personal manuscript in which he decried integration and used racial slurs to refer to blacks.",bdc95b30-e47a-45e9-8829-00c18e972de7,News,2015-09-03T19:01:13Z,Northern Territory News,Death penalty sought for 'church shooter',0.0,Blog
3615,"mxHero transparently embeds the security & compliance capabilities of the best enterprise cloud storage technologies into email

San Francisco, CA (PRWEB) September 28, 2015 

Leading email to cloud storage integration technology company, mxHero, integrates cloud storage security features into its flagship Mail2Cloud product suite. The new features allow organizations to centralize email data while automatically and seamlessly setting the appropriate security on files sent or received through email. The security is applied regardless of user device or email program, requiring no end user training or changes to workflow. By offering organizations an always-on yet near transparent solution, mxHero’s Mail2Cloud ensures greater security and compliance without inconvenience to end users. 

The new Mail2Cloud cloud security integration works by automatically replacing emails with Box cloud storage links. The security level of the inserted links is centrally determined in accordance to the origin and destination of the message. For example, all email attachments sent within the organization will be uploaded to Box and replaced with file share links restricted to internal access only. mxHero works in tandem with the company’s existing email server avoiding the logistical and cultural barriers associated with deploying end user software and behavioral change. 

Mail2Cloud’s new features help organizations better meet their regulatory compliance. By automatically applying Box security to attachments, organizations that are required to observe specific rules around delivery of certain types of information through email, such as healthcare providers, financial services and educational institutions, are more assured that compliance is being fulfilled. Mail2Cloud ensures that all attachments sent by doctors, for example, to patients are automatically delivered with HIPAA compliance. Significantly, end users need not remember to send attachments securely or resort to secure delivery portals. Mail2Cloud works in the background assuring the appropriate security is applied to all attachments before delivery. 

“mxHero’s unique approach to email security is to get content that is otherwise unprotected in email, out of email but without breaking email as the communication medium. The only other way to send content safely through email is to use email encryption - which after decades has failed to take hold because it requires too much engineering on both sides of the line,” explains Alex Panagides, CEO, mxHero Inc.

mxHero’s Mail2Cloud suite is available through the company’s service portal, http://dashboard.mail2cloud.io. 

About mxHero 

mxHero is a company dedicated to enhancing email for businesses and end users. mxHero’s products and services gives companies, service providers and end users powerful new ways to control, use and analyze email. Apps developed for mxHero’s platform work with any email management program, including Gmail and Microsoft Exchange.

1362,"After availing themselves to much media manipulation and to political machinations, women in Egypt are back in a very familiar place and one where they have been before. The state is paying lip service to their rights but dismantling their abilities to mobilise.

Women are present but in retreat! By women, I mean the women’s movement. By retreat I refer to the deflation of a dynamism that saw women contesting, protesting, challenging and forming alliances and its replacement with a rather flaccid support for a strong state that is the champion and protector of women.

The state has delivered on many of its promises to women. The creation of specialist anti-harassment units in the Ministry of Interior was in response to a women’s movement lobby and is an important step towards safer streets.

The president spoke out against sexual harassment by visiting one of the savagely attacked victims during the presidential election celebrations and urged the government to issue a harsh harassment law. By so doing he became the first head of state to recognise and condemn such savage attacks. But there have also been other gains made on behalf of women.

The quota for women in local councils is perhaps the most significant attainment realised by women and one that can potentially change the political structures of Egypt. The 2014 constitution mandates the election of at least 13,000 thousand women to local councils.

At a more symbolic level we find more gains. The Ministry of Justice has recently appointed a female deputy minister and has confirmed the entry of women into the judiciary in response to long standing demands from women’s groups.

Women have also been celebrated as the loyal and trustworthy allies of the state. They stood firm against ‘ikhwanisation’ (Muslim Brotherhood influence) and mobilised in their millions to approve the constitution of 2014 and vote for the current president and as such are lauded and celebrated, or at least some of them are!

On the other hand and in contrast to symbolic or substantive gestures of gender justice, there have been systematic negations of women’s rights. At the formal level, evidence can be found in the neglect of the National Council for Women. The term of the current council ended in March 2015. The deliberations for selecting a new national council for women have taken place in closed circles and have not yet yielded a new council.

The council is comprised of a head and 29 members. The selection of these women and men is happening through personal nominations of ‘trusted insiders’ and filtered through the routine and excessive security and executive checks. There may well be 30 amazing people who have been selected but the process by which this organ of state feminism is being built is essentially antithetical to the idea of accountable, representative or transparent national machinery.

Meanwhile, women’s organisations have suffered as collateral damage as a result of the stringent civil society restrictions and regulations that have targeted human rights work. Their ability to organise and mobilise is curtailed and their funds have been diminished. Women in political parties who were instrumental in organising the 30th of June 2015 demonstrations and sit- ins are also challenged by the dysfunctional state of their parties.

Women have been here before! A century ago women began to mobilise and form a united front to gain basic rights but it was the post 1952 revolution regime that gave them these rights as a presidential gift and not in response to political pressure. Once again, the state is recognising some rights of women but curtailing the ability of a women’s movement to make claims or to pressure for change or recognition. 

Once again the state is approaching issues of gender justice and of women’s rights as a set of formal or institutional arrangements that are peppered with slogans and symbolic gestures. 

Egypt may well have a 30 member NCW, a women’s department in the police force, 13,000 women elected as local council members, a few female judges, a lot of lip service being paid to the “Great Egyptian Woman”, and some prominent women who are present in the public sphere and who use themselves as evidence of the high regard in which women are held by polity and by society. But none of these structures or symbols will matter if there isn’t a vibrant, veritable and free movement to guard any gains, hold power to account and represent the interests and realities of women.

The state cannot be a substitute for society or expropriate civil space in the name of paternalism or protection. The National Council for women is not a proxy for women as a whole. It is simply a machinery dedicated to the cause of gender equality and not a tool to sequester women’s voices.

Hopefully the new council will honour this responsibility and build on the strong voice and presence of the current (and now elapsed) NCW leadership.",88e3d4c9-c112-473a-95af-ed316a07e486,News,2015-09-13T16:08:28Z,Al Ahram,The trouble with women in Egypt!,0.0,News

2268,"GOP scrambles to avoid shutdown over planned parenthoodBy ANDREW TAYLOR and ALAN FRAM
Associated Press
Published: Thursday, September 17, 2015 at 6:01 a.m.Last Modified: Thursday, September 17, 2015 at 11:28 p.m.WASHINGTON — House Republican leaders scrambled Thursday to head off a politically damaging government shutdown in two weeks over rebellious conservatives’ demand that any stopgap spending bill block federal funds for Planned Parenthood.Leadership sought an outlet for GOP lawmakers’ outrage after this summer’s release of videos secretly recorded by abortion foes, who contend they show that Planned Parenthood illegally profits from selling tissue from aborted fetuses to medical researchers.
Unclear is whether a vote Friday to defund Planned Parenthood and other steps will be enough to placate conservatives, emboldened by widespread criticism of the organization at Wednesday’s GOP presidential debate.
Temporary funding legislation is needed to give the chronically dysfunctional Congress more time to sort through huge differences over a full-year spending bill that could ease a budget freeze facing the Pentagon and domestic agencies. Top congressional Democrats exiting a meeting with President Barack Obama on Thursday said any temporary funding measure should have a short time-span and that Democrats would demand increases for domestic agencies.
“We want to make sure we have equal money for defense and non-defense,” said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. In the final months of the year, another possible shutdown looms over Obama’s demand that the GOP-led Congress to increase the nation’s borrowing authority.
What is clear is that the once-routine job of advancing a short-term spending bill to keep the government open past an Oct. 1 deadline remains a major headache for House GOP leaders, chiefly Speaker John Boehner. Some hard-right lawmakers and tea partyers are threatening to try to topple the Ohio Republican, a fierce foe of abortion who has held the speakership since January 2011.
“We’ve seen promises to fight tooth and nail on things in the past and it hasn’t really materialized,” said tea party-backed Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz. “I think there will be a point where the thin ice breaks.”
The ice could be breaking between Boehner and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who met for 20 minutes after she returned from meeting with Obama. Aides declined to characterize the session.
Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., accused Boehner of “subverting our republic,” and working for lobbyists rather than “what the constituents of our district want.”
Boehner’s clear but unstated preference is to pass a temporary funding bill that’s free of the Planned Parenthood controversy. Democrats are sure to filibuster any bill defunding Planned Parenthood should it come to a vote in the Senate, and Obama has promised a veto regardless.
The organization, which provides birth control, abortions and various women’s health services, says it’s done nothing wrong.
“If you’re pro-life, the last thing you want to do is have the focus changed to the government shutdown ... rather than the activities of Planned Parenthood,” said Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, a Boehner ally. “At some point in time you’ve got to face reality.”
The White House, in a statement released Thursday evening, said Obama called the shutdown threat “a game of chicken with our economy that we cannot accept.”
At a closed-door GOP meeting Thursday, Republicans were shown party polling data that showed most Americans haven’t seen the videos and that more Americans associate Planned Parenthood with women’s health than with abortions. The numbers also showed that most Americans don’t want a government shutdown, lawmakers at the meeting said.
A significant majority of Republicans would support Boehner if he were to press for a temporary bill disentangled from the dispute over Planned Parenthood. But a few dozen of the most conservative Republicans have vowed to oppose any such effort, and some are weighing a challenge to Boehner’s leadership.
Asked how confident he was that he could defeat an effort to remove him from the post, Boehner said, “Very.”
Other GOP members say tea party lawmakers have repeatedly driven GOP leaders into unwinnable fights. They highlight the 16-day partial government shutdown over health care two years ago and a failed attempt this year to use a Department of Homeland Security funding bill to reverse Obama’s moves easing the threat of deportation for millions of immigrants living in the country illegally.
“They’re kind of like their own party,” said Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif. “You can’t really do anything about it because they’re right-wing Marxists. It’s unpredictable what they’re going to do.”
Hillary Clinton went on the offensive Thursday, the day after the attack on Planned Parenthood was front and center in a debate of GOP presidential candidates.
“It’s bad enough to see hateful rhetoric and lies in a presidential debate. But just like the candidates on stage last night, Republicans in Congress want to defund Planned Parenthood. And they’re willing to shut down the federal government to do it, no matter how bad that is for our country,” said the Democratic front runner.
So for now, GOP leaders are pushing free-standing bills blocking Planned Parenthood’s money and curbing abortion that are not tied to money to keep the government functioning. In addition, four congressional committees are investigating Planned Parenthood.
Right to Life’s leaders released a statement this week endorsing a bill by Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., halting federal payments to Planned Parenthood for a year. The House plans to approve that bill on Friday, along with another by Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., setting criminal penalties for medical providers who don’t try to save babies born live during abortions.

2304,"If it successfully lists, the Bitcoin Group will have a market valuation of almost $33 million. 

After two aborted moves to list on the Australian Securities Exchange, the Bitcoin Group will be attempting to close its offer round as it heads towards an initial public offering in early November.

The company's core business is bitcoin ""mining"": the procuring of the digital currency by solving complicated equations to record the transaction onto blockchain, which functions as an official and distributed ledger.

Bitcoin mining is a burgeoning field. In 2014-15, the company mined almost $2 million worth of the crypto-currency.

The bitcoin is notoriously volatile so the prospectus outlines a range of forecasts, pricing the unit between $250 per coin and $550 per coin. Projected revenue for the year ending June 2016 ranges from $21.3 million to $63.7 million.

If it successfully lists, it will have a market valuation of almost $33 million. It will become the second bitcoin start-up to list on the ASX after digitalBTC. The latter joined the ASX through a $9.1 million reverse listing in 2014.

However, the Melbourne-based Chinese company's journey towards an IPO has not been smooth.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has issued two stop orders on the company's initial raising efforts. The first was within a fortnight of receiving the original prospectus and the second, after the group was found to be promoting the fundraising round on a Chinese social media platform, WeChat, before the prospectus was approved and lodged.

The company's third prospectus outlines plans to raise $20 million, of which 90 per cent will go towards developing operations conducted mostly across three sites in China, one in Iceland and a newer facility in Australia, and particularly the high electricity costs of bitcoin mining.

The remaining 10 per cent will go towards repaying start-up loans made by the three directors, which total $230,000, marketing and the listing process cost.

ASX shareholders will own more than half the company, 60.6 per cent, when the offer is complete. The three executive directors – Samuel Lee, Ryan Xu and Allan Guo – will own 8.6 per cent in total.

The Melbourne-based company chairman, Andrew Plympton, has held board and chairman positions in a range of industries for more than a decade. He is a non-executive director at the Australian Olympic Foundation and the Australian Sports Commission. He is also chairman of several early stage technology ventures including Shoply​ and Entellect​.

Most of the company's revenue, 98.5 per cent, is produced through Chinese operations. The prospectus lists this as a key risk in the undertaking, as well as the fluctuating bitcoin price and the relatively new industry finding its way.

""As bitcoin is a new technology, it is still being considered by various governments. There is a risk that bitcoin may be declared illegal, in which case this may impact on the value of bitcoins and revenue,"" the prospectus warns.

The Bitcoin Group hopes to join the ASX on November 11 with shares starting at 20¢. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.",cf37e979-a040-4e51-8847-ca68e90ef992,News,2015-09-27T04:08:13Z,Wagga Wagga Daily Advertiser,IPO Watch: Bitcoin Group wraps up offer round to target November ASX listing,0.0,Blog
253,"The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources released information Sept. 10 about how interested people can apply to be a member of the Mille Lacs Fisheries Advisory Committee that will work with the DNR on issues and programs relevant to Mille Lacs Lake. 
The action comes in the wake of the DNR closing the lake to walleye fishing Aug. 3 because the fishing limits had been reached. Before the close, a community meeting on the potential of it drew 75 or so people anxious about their livelihood and way of life – walleye fishing – and angry about what some called mismanagement of the lake over the years. Gov. Mark Dayton visited Mille Lacs Lake after the meeting to learn more about the issues. 
The DNR has released information in the past days and weeks relevant to the situation. 
Walleye committee forms 
According to news releases and DNR communications director Chris Niskanen, the committee is open to 12-16 people who may apply online at www.dnr.state.mn.us/millelacslake/index.html; scroll down to the underlined text link for “apply to serve on a newly formed Mille Lacs Lake Fisheries Advisory Committee.” People can also call 651-259-5221 for more information about the committee. 
The deadline to apply is Sept. 24, when applications will be considered and DNR Commissioner Tom Landwehr will appoint the members. Niskanen said a media announcement of the new members would be made sometime before the committee’s first meeting Oct. 8. Members serve a two-year term of service, and the new committee replaces the Mille Lacs Fisheries Input Group, which was formed in 1997 and consisted of citizens and business owners from the Mille Lacs Lake area, the release says. 
Membership on the committee will include diverse angling interests such as local business, tourism, tribal, academic and local and county government. The DNR release said, “To improve openness and transparency of technical discussions, two committee members will also be asked to attend meetings of the state and tribal fisheries technical committee as observers.” 
Landwehr said in the release: “This committee will play an important role in furthering the dialogue about Mille Lacs Lake and focusing on issues relevant to the state’s management of the lake. We want committee members and the public to have a more structured and participative process to provide meaningful input, with a goal of reaching a shared understanding with the DNR about issues and potential solutions affecting the Mille Lacs Lake fishery.” 
Plan includes hatchery 
An Aug. 27 news release says the DNR will work with the Legislature during the 2016 session to secure bond funding for a new fisheries management facility that will include a cool-water hatchery to be built in the Mille Lacs community. It would provide room for monitoring equipment and staff and accommodate educational and visitor functions, as well as be a place to hold public-information meetings. Niskanen said it is too soon to know when the hatchery might be built because the project is “still in the design and funding phase.” 
Local fisheries office, project leader in the works 
Until a new hatchery building is available, the DNR will lease an office in a community near the lake to house the project leader and other Mille Lacs Lake staff. The people will provide more capacity to monitor conditions, communicate with local stakeholders, help with hatchery and stocking efforts and help the community with outreach and marketing. Niskanen said the staff and location for the office have not yet been chosen but will be announced when in place. 
Stock fish, stop cormorants 
The DNR will stock walleye fry in Mille Lacs Lake in 2016 in a pilot effort to develop and refine techniques. A news release says stocking is not necessary, but the DNR wants to be ready to go if and when it becomes necessary. The pilot will help develop techniques to maintain the unique genetics of the lake, ensure that aquatic invasive species in Mille Lacs are not spread to other water bodies and identify appropriate stocking levels. The DNR staff will chemically mark walleye fry to study their survival throughout their life cycle. Egg-take, hatching and stocking will occur in spring of 2016. 
DNR information about Mille Lacs Lake also says the DNR is talking with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to secure control permits for double-crested cormorants. Niskanen said the techniques for control will be determined in partnership with the USFWS but said in other state and national control projects, the birds are either shot or vegetable oil can be applied to their eggs to render them unviable. 
Promote alternates 
The DNR release says it will promote other fishing opportunities in the lake, including northern pike, smallmouth bass and muskellunge plus the many recreational resources in the region, such as hunting lands, state parks, bike trails, ATV and snowmobile trails and paddling opportunities. The DNR and Explore Minnesota Tourism are collaborating on a “Do the Lake” outreach campaign.",49ae632f-598c-4b46-8fa7-60f41697dfc5,Blog,2015-09-24T01:20:32Z,The Princeton Union-Eagle,Mille Lacs Lake walleye committee forms,1.0,News

682,"Pierce Brosnan has said he may be over 60 but he can still throw a punch and he is not ready to retire from action just yet. 
 
The former James Bond star revealed he is planning a sequel to his 2014 film The November Man, in which he played an ex-CIA man who found himself pulled out of retirement for a special mission. 
 
Pierce said: “I’m 62 years of age and so you just have to be aware that unless you’re really physically fit you can damage yourself pretty fast in these pieces. So there will come a slower time, yes. 
 [embedded content] 
“I’m aware of my physicality as a man, as an actor and you can only do action movies for so long, and then it’s time to bow out gracefully and let younger men do it. 
 
“But I think I can still run, I can still throw a punch, it remains to be seen…” 
 
He added: “We are going to try and do a November Man 2. I got away with the last one and I think this next one, if everything goes to plan, will up the ante a little bit more, give it a bit of a sheen and just juice it up a little bit more.” 
 [embedded content] 
Pierce stars alongside Salma Hayek and Jessica Alba in new romantic comedy Lessons In Love, which also stars 72-year-old Malcolm McDowell as his father. 
 
The Mamma Mia! star said: “Malcolm was a kick in the pants! He’s actually as charming and reverent and naughty and as bold as the day he was born. He is a unique talent, from the landscape of thespians. I was very, very proud to work with him, that he wanted to work with me was an utter joy. 
 
“I did say, ‘Listen you’re too young to be my father, this is crazy! But I don’t care, if you want to do it, do it.’ And that’s what happened.”

4088,"FOOD DETECTIVE: Getting recipes for your favorite dishes from area restaurants 
 
To say that Birminghamians harbor an insatiable appetite for Greek food would be an understatement. Consider this: during the upcoming three-day Greek Festival diners will scoff down some 12,000 pieces of chicken, 9,000 grape leaves, 5,000 pounds of Greek rice, 22,000 pieces of baklava and 12,000 servings of Greek lasagna (pastichio). Wow! That's a whole lot of eating! 

Hosted by members of Holy Trinity-Holy Cross Greek Orthodox Cathedral Church, the festival has been described as ""an act of love of Birmingham's Greek community going back to four generations."" 
 
The love will be well received when some 20,000 people turn out to hear Greek music, witness Greek dance performances and savor tempting Greek dishes prepared from recipes handed down for generations. 
 
Chefs for the year's event have graciously shared their recipe for Greek chicken which has been served since the beginning 43 years ago. 
 Greek chicken with Greek pilaf is the most popular entree served at the Greek Festival. (courtesy)    
""The Greek chicken is one of the most popular items on the menu,"" according to Kitchen Chairman Pete Graphos Sr. 

Served with rice pilaf, Greek salad and a roll, the Greek chicken plate sells for $11. While items are sold a la carte, many prefer the Deluxe Plate ($17) that includes Greek chicken, pastichio, rice pilaf, spanakopita, tiropita, Greek salad and a roll.

4408,"There are now multiple investigations inside the intelligence community and on Capitol Hill into whether senior intelligence officers at U.S. Central Command altered intelligence assessments of the U.S. war against the Islamic State. The main whistleblower will meet with senior senators on the matter as early as next week.In addition to the Pentagon inspector general's investigation into allegations by dozens of intelligence analysts, other inspectors general inside the intelligence community and two oversight committees in Congress have begun their own probes, according to senior lawmakers and intelligence officials.The Congressional investigations will expand the scope of the existing inquiry by examining allegations of intelligence tampering that predate the war against the Islamic State, some dating back years.Staffers from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Armed Services Committee have already met with the main whistleblower to discuss the allegations, Senate sources told us. The lawmakers in charge of those committees are working to schedule another meeting with him soon.""We're on it,"" Armed Services Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., told us. Asked if the allegations of intelligence tampering go beyond just reports on the yearlong war against the Islamic State, he said: ""That's my understanding, but I have no hard evidence of that. That's why we are going to have this meeting.""Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said he and other relevant House committees are starting to probe the most recent allegations of intelligence manipulation as well as past charges that intelligence was suppressed at U.S. Central Command, also known as CENTCOM.""We are encouraging additional whistleblowers to come forward,"" Nunes, R-Calif., told us. ""We are initiating a process to gather information about this, and we are working closely with all the committees of jurisdiction to have a coordinated effort.""Nunes also told us that there are now multiple inspectors general inside the intelligence community investigating the allegations made by CENTCOM analysts.
Other lawmakers, such as Republicans on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, have urged the inspector general for the entire intelligence community, housed at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, to open an investigation into the matter. Instead, that inspector general will be assisting the Pentagon inspector's inquiry, a senior intelligence official told us.Andrea Williams, the spokeswoman for the inspector general for the intelligence community, told us her office is ""not conducting a parallel or joint investigation into allegations raised concerning activities at CENTCOM. We are providing liaison assistance to the Department of Defense Inspector General."" She added that when Defense Department's inspector general completes its report, her office will determine whether to further review the allegations.""Our goal is to ensure that we know, at the end of this evaluation, whether the intelligence provided to senior federal decision-makers was analyzed according to the rules and regulations"" promulgated through relevant directives on such oversight.The roots of the intelligence scandal go back to July when The New York Times reported that the Pentagon's inspector general had launched an investigation into allegations that intelligence products had been distorted by CENTCOM's top intelligence officer. The Daily Beast earlier this month reported that 50 CENTCOM analysts backed up the allegations in the initial complaint, an almost unprecedented revolt inside military intelligence.U.S. intelligence officials tell us the objections began when an analyst in charge of Iraq intelligence at CENTCOM for more than 13 years complained through intelligence community whistleblower processes that the assessments produced by his unit were being rejected or distorted before they reached decision makers.One former senior U.S. military official familiar with the charges told us the frustrated analysts were being asked to assess progress in the war against the Islamic State based on statistics of airstrikes, vehicles hit, or enemy fighters killed, statistics that are meaningless without deeper context about the Islamic State's ability to recruit forces or hold territory.The analysts also wanted to evaluate the adversary's core strength, command-and-control structure, and ability to recruit and move forces within its territory.Top officials like Secretary of State John Kerry have used isolated statistics to show progress, but those figures often do not stand up to scrutiny. Retired Gen. John Allen, who will resign this fall as the president's envoy to the collation against the Islamic State, used to say that half of the group's leaders in Iraq had been killed. That was an exaggeration.Nunes told us that he was also looking into earlier complaints about pressure on intelligence analysts that predate the current war against the Islamic State. Last week, Fox News and the Weekly Standard reported that Nunes in 2012 arrived at the Tampa CENTCOM headquarters for a meeting with analysts on the documents seized in the 2011 raid on Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan, only to be told later that no analysts were working on that particular Saturday. Nunes said he learned later that this was not true.""Dating back to 2012, people within Central Command came to me with very damaging allegations about the intelligence process and specifically as it related to access to the bin Laden documents,"" Nunes told us.Nunes may end up learning that the problem was only within U.S. Central Command. But if his investigation also implicates other senior U.S. intelligence leaders, the issue could become sensitive for the White House. The Obama administration has not had a major intelligence scandal like the one that so weakened the administration of George W. Bush after the invasion of Iraq. But then again, the Obama administration has never before faced a revolt on the scale of what is happening inside CENTCOM now.Eli Lake is a Bloomberg View columnist who writes about politics and foreign affairs.

2666,"Leading entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter has said it is time for Scotland to ""move on"" from last year's independence referendum.

The Sports Division founder said politicians must respect the result of the vote - in which Scots voted by 55% to 45% to stay in the UK - as he called on party rivals to unite and ""focus upon building a more prosperous, productive and fairer Scotland where opportunity prevails for all"".

Sir Tom made the comments as The Hunter Foundation published a new report by Professor David Bell of Stirling University looking at changes to devolution in the wake of the September 18 ballot.

The Smith Commission, which was set up after the referendum, recommended Holyrood get new tax and welfare powers, with legislation currently going through Westminster.

But Prof Bell's report warned that ""o verall the transfer of the new powers will be at best a zero sum game"". 

He said there was ""every likelihood"" the Scottish Government would ""have more control over Scottish affairs but less money than under previous fiscal settlements to invest"" unless it uses its new tax-raising powers. 

The Scottish Government will be able to raise £17.7 billion of its annual budget of about £30 billion, the report said. 

While new powers over income tax in the Scotland Bill have the ""greatest potential"" for increasing revenues, the report argued hikes in this are ""highly unpopular in the UK"", pointing out that recent chancellors have used ""stealth taxes"" to boost their spending power. 

""Because Smith's proposals cover a narrow range of highly visible taxes, the Scottish Government will not have access to the more subtle ways that recent chancellors of the exchequer have used to raise cash,"" the report said. 

""Though there maybe no reason in principle why Scotland should not increase income tax rates, Scottish governments may not wish to put their popularity at risk by doing so."" 

Additional welfare powers will add about £2.7 billion a year to the amount the Scottish Government needs to spend, the report stated. 

But it added the Scotland Bill differs from the Smith Commission recommendations in ""two important ways"", saying: "" The power to create new benefits only applies to those areas where responsibility is to be devolved. This implies the Scottish Government could create a new benefit for carers but not for the unemployed. 

""The transfer of individuals from disability living allowance to personal independence payments is to continue even though these benefits are to be devolved. This is highly unpopular because the tests for PIP eligibility are widely though to be unfair.""

Sir Tom said the report had been published because ""a year on we felt it important to review what was promised, what was delivered - or is in the process of being - what was missing and where we would be had we voted Yes"". 

With no agreement in place over the amount Scotland receives in its block grant from Westminster, Sir Tom added: ""W e sit in a bit of a beggars muddle where the Scottish Government is negotiating with HM Treasury over settlements; a negotiation that will undoubtedly fuel consistent sniping that Scotland is not getting enough of its share. 

""For me, personally, it's time to move on, move forward and use the powers we have. The population decided, politicians are democratically elected and should and must respect the decision of the voters.

""We are all ambitious for Scotland and its time for us to come together, put our differences aside and focus upon building a more prosperous, productive and fairer Scotland where opportunity prevails for all.""

Labour's shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray said: "" Sir Tom Hunter again has said that Scotland needs to move on from the arguments of the past and face the future. He is absolutely right to do so. 

""Scottish Labour wants to cut the gap between the rich and the rest in education to ensure that every child in every classroom gets the best possible start in life.

""We want to equip our young people with the skills for the jobs of tomorrow and protect our NHS for the challenges it will face in the next few decades. It's time to face the future, not argue about the past.

""The SNP and the Tories want to continue to bicker about the constitution because they can't defend their record in government, whether it is cutting tax credits for the working poor or an education system which sees a majority of those from poor backgrounds without the skills they need in reading, writing or numeracy. It's time to move on.""

A spokesman for the SNP said: "" Tom Hunter is right to point out that the Scotland Bill falls well short of even the limited powers of the Smith Commission - leaving too many key powers in the hands of the UK Government which should be transferred to Scotland. 

""Full economic powers need to be in Scotland's hands to allow Scotland's parliament to take action to grow the economy, support business and create jobs - rather than having growth held back by the austerity policies of David Cameron and George Osborne.

""With only 9% of people in Scotland believing the vow has been delivered and with an out-of-touch Tory government we didn't elect engaged in a relentless assault on the most vulnerable people in Scotland, it's no wonder support for independence is continuing to grow - as more and more people question whether Westminster is capable of representing Scotland's interests at all.""",d3f87d44-d58a-4ac1-b260-56f50af00b6c,News,2015-09-16T23:30:45Z,TalkTalk,Time to move on from independence...,0.0,News
1751,"by Juliana Keeping 
Crescent (United States) (AFP) | 20 September 2015 5:43 

Located in the middle of the country, far from any major fault lines, Oklahoma experienced 585 earthquakes of a magnitude of 3.0 or greater in 2014. That’s more than three times as many as the 180 which hit California last year. 
 
“It’s completely unprecedented,” said George Choy, a seismologist at the US Geological Survey. 
 
As of last month, Oklahoma has already experienced more than 600 quakes strong enough to rattle windows and rock cars. The biggest was a 4.5-magnitude quake that hit the small town of Crescent. 
 
Sandra Voskuhl, 76, grew up in the rural oil boomtown and said she has never felt the earth shake like it did on July 27. 
 
First came a thunderous boom. Then the red earth shook hard, Voskuhl said. 
 
“You heard it coming,” she said. “Everything shook.” 
 
She recalled screaming as framed pictures toppled over in her home. 
 
Then, when things got quiet, she drove over to the town’s Frontier Historical Museum to help clean up antique dishes that had crashed to the ground and shattered. 
 
“We need the oil for our workers and our economy,” she said. “But these earthquakes are a little scary.” 
 
– Could a ‘Big One’ hit? – 
   File picture shows anti-fracking demonstrators in New York as world leaders gathered for a UN General Assembly | © /AFP/File | Bryan Thomas   
Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is the process of shooting water mixed with sand and chemicals deep into the earth to crack rock formations and bring up oil and natural gas trapped inside. 
 
The process has unlocked massive amounts of oil and gas in Oklahoma and other states over the past decade. 
 
But along with the oil and gas comes plenty of that brackish water, which is disposed of by injecting it into separate wells that are dug as deep as a mile (less than two kilometers) below ground. 
 
The unnatural addition of the water can change pressure along fault lines, causing slips that make the earth shake, said Choy of the US Geological Survey. 
 
There is debate among scientists over how large of a fault could be reawakened, and how hard that fault might shake. 
 
One camp believes Oklahoma won’t see bigger than a 4.0 to 5.0-magnitude earthquake, which would be enough to break windows and knock things off shelves. 
 
Others believe a 7.0-magnitude earthquake could come about, which would be strong enough to topple buildings. 
 
“What’s at risk is that when you put water into the ground, it’s never going to come back out. You’re putting it in places it has never been before,” Choy told AFP. 
 
“The bigger the volume, the greater the area will be affected. And we don’t know what the long-term effect will be.” 
 
– 4,500 injection wells – 
 
The pace at which earthquake activity has increased has rattled many in Oklahoma, who are also worried about groundwater contamination brought on by fracking. 
 
From 1975 to 2008, the state experienced anywhere from zero to three earthquakes a year which registered at 3.0 or higher. 
 
Then the numbers jumped: there were 20 in 2009, 35 in 2010, 64 in 2011, 35 in 2012, 109 in 2013 and 585 in 2014. 
 
“We are the only state where once this problem came up, we just kept going (with fracking),” said Johnson Bridgwater, the executive director of the Oklahoma chapter of the Sierra Club, a prominent environmental group. 
 
“We want public safety to come first, rather than treating this state as a giant lab.” 
 
The danger is particularly acute given that Oklahoma has such an enormous oil and gas industry, and its pipelines, refineries and storage facilities were not built to withstand constant quakes, Bridgwater said. 
 
Oklahoma has about 4,500 disposal wells, with about 3,200 operating on any given day. 
 
State Governor Mary Fallin, a pro-business Republican, was slow to accept the link between fracking and earthquakes. 
 
She took action earlier this year after the science became clear, spokesman Alex Weintz said. 
 
It appears that an area known as the Arbuckle rock formation is most vulnerable because of its “unique geological features,” he noted. 
 
State regulators are now scrutinizing the operations of disposal wells in that area to ensure they don’t go too deep or inject too much water. 
 
Some operators have been told to cut the amount of water they inject into their wells and the state has also stepped up its monitoring. 
 
Three wells were shut down on Friday after two quakes – a 3.5 and a 4.1 – struck near Cushing, which has one of the largest crude oil storage facilities in the world. 
 
“We are hopeful that the actions taken by the Corporation Commission will have a significant impact on seismicity, but the process is ongoing and we’ll continue to evaluate the results that we’re getting now and potential future actions,” Weintz told AFP. 
 
The Sierra Club insists that much more needs to be done and has called for a moratorium on wastewater injection wells in the 21 Oklahoma counties identified to be most at risk.

2044,"REEHOLD -- Jessica O'Brien's biggest responsibility on Monday afternoon was to keep one of the biggest goal-scoring threats in New Jersey off the board. 

But it was O'Brien's offensive play that turned the game around. 

O'Brien shut down Rutgers commit Nicole Whitley, but her steal and ensuing through ball to forward Betty Feinstein in the 65th minute sent Howell to a stunning 1-0 win over Freehold Township, No. 18 in the NJ.com Top 20, in a typical Shore Conference showdown. 

Feinstein took O'Brien's pass along the right side of the box and slipped the only goal of the game past Freehold Township keeper Kaela Chadziutko and inside the left post to give Howell its fourth straight win since starting the season 1-2. 

""We knew we had to mark up on Whitley, so we marked her 1-on-1 and everyone else just had to play tough D,"" Howell coach Courtney Bonura said. ""We knew we could muscle it out against them. We were fortunate enough to get the through ball that we capitalized on."" 

Freehold Township controlled possession throughout the game and had a number of chances in the contest, but Howell's back line -- led by Penn State commit Rebecca Hamilton -- never let Freehold Township find the back of the net. Rebels goalkeeper Rachel Kern made 11 saves, six in the second half, to earn the shutout. 

""It felt really good because I know a lot of people on that team, I know how they play,"" Feinstein said. ""I know a lot of people on Township usually step up. I was happy that through ball was there, and the goalie wasn't able to get down fast enough to stop my shot to the bottom left. So that's where I placed it."" 

Howell nearly took the lead in the 30th minute, when Feinstein fed forward Sierra Enea, but Chadziutko made the diving save. Whitley countered with a strong chance in the 32nd minute, but her shot was spiked wide of net. 

Laura Noseworthy, after making a couple of moves to slip behind Howell's defenders, found herself in alone in the 61st minute, but Kern kicked out her left leg to keep the ball in front of the goal line and preserve the shutout. 

Since starting the season 5-0, Freehold Township has gone 0-1-1 in its last two games after a 1-1 tie with Freehold Borough and its first loss of the season to Howell.

A social media campaign that solicited signatures on a petition calling for authorities to arrest Netanyahu for war crimes pursuant to the UK’s third-party war crimes law proved to be a red-herring when it ignored the legal exemption for heads of governments. Nevertheless, some view impact of more than 100,000 signatures a public relations victory and nevertheless a blow to Netanyahu and to Israel. And while demonstrators make their case behind the police barricades, Cameron is expected to apply the diplomatic heat inside when he criticizes Israeli policy of building in areas it acquired in the 1967 war that are claimed by the Palestinians and accuses his counterpart of foot-dragging on Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.

Slimbridge 0 Didcot Town 0 

After a week of FA Cup heroics, the Swans played out a largely uneventful draw with a Didcot side who seemed to have settled for a point long before the final whistle. 

The best chances of the game went to the home side, and possibly on another day they would have nicked the three points, but it was not to be. 


As the game settled down, it became clear that chances would be at a premium, as both sides largely cancelled each other out - it took 12 minutes for the first shot on goal, Adam Thomas pushing away a strike from the visitors' Matthew Woodley. 
 
After another half hour of goalmouth inactivity, Slimbridge had the better opportunities as the game neared the interval - after a Rich Thwaite header from Adam Mace's cross was wide, Mace went close with a long range effort on 41 minutes, and then Jamie Hammond brought a great save from Diddy Keeper Leigh Bedwell after a nice break, but the sides went into the interval level. 

Ten minutes into the second half, Paul Fahy chased a through ball and forced another good stop from Bedwell, while Diddy were restricted to rare opportunities - Mark Janes going closest with a shot that went wide on 70 minutes. 

The hosts had chances to claim the points in the final tem minutes, but Jack Twyman's high shot, followed by two Jamie Martin headers which were too high meant that this was a game that would not live long in the memory, but another was another point gained for the Swans as they continue their adjustment to life in the Southern League. 

Slimbridge make the long trip to Dartford to play Greenwich Borough next Sunday (3pm) in an FA Cup 1st Qualifying Round tie - the first time they have got this far in the competition for 9 years. The Coach leaves Wisloe Road at 9.30am.

1674,"OTTAWA - Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, taking the offensive after an election campaign marred by setbacks and missteps, on Thursday said his rivals would badly damage the economy if they took power. 
 
With polls showing a tight three-way race ahead of the Oct. 19 vote, Harper needs to break away from his two centre-left opponents if his right-leaning Conservatives are to have any chance of extending their near 10-year term in office. 
 
Harper has long portrayed himself as the only leader able to handle a sluggish economy amid global weakness. This week trumpeted the fact the federal budget had returned to surplus a year earlier than predicted. 
 
""The other parties are trying to tell us they will deal with the challenges of our economy, of our labor market, of international markets, by raising taxes and running deficits to finance vastly increased amounts of spending,"" he told a televised debate about the economy. 
 
""That is not the way to protect our economy in this environment,"" he said in often testy exchanges with New Democratic Party leader Thomas Mulcair, 60, and Liberal leader Justin Trudeau, 43. 
 
Harper says Canada should stick to Conservative policies designed to keep taxes low and attract investment. He brushes off calls for more government spending. 
 
The Liberals are proposing to run budget deficits for three years to help finance a major national infrastructure program. 
 
""Mr Harper wants to hit the snooze button while Mr Trudeau is hitting the panic button,"" said Mulcair. His party - which has never held power federally - said this week it would raise the corporate tax rate.. 
 
The debate, the second of the campaign, was sponsored by the Globe and Mail newspaper. 
 
It took place in Harper's adopted hometown of Calgary in the western energy-producing province of Alberta, which has been hard hit by slumping crude prices. 
 
Mulcair accused Harper of relying far too much on oil exports to buoy government finances. The price of crude has dropped by more than half since mid-2014. 
 
""Mr. Harper put all his eggs in one basket and then he dropped the basket,"" he said. 
 
Trudeau said Harper had presided over the worst growth rate of any prime minister since the Great Depression. 
 
""Canadians are worried about their jobs, and that's what this election is about,"" said Trudeau.

ROANOKE, Va. (AP) -- The latest on the funeral for Adam Ward, the WDBJ-TV cameraman who was fatally shot by a former co-worker on live TV Wednesday in Moneta, Virginia (all times local): 
 
Noon: 
 
The pastor at the church attended by Adam Ward's family told mourners that just as in life, the WDBJ-TV cameraman has left an impact on others through his death. 
 
The Rev. Rob Lough told more than 500 people at Ward's funeral at First Baptist Church in Roanoke about Ward's compassion and laughter, his passion and wit. 
 
Lough related several jokes that the Virginia Tech graduate would tell at the expense of archrival University of Virginia. 
 
Lough told several stories, including the time Ward's principal at Salem High School, who uses a wheelchair, challenged him to a race. 
 
Another story was about when Ward disrupted the press box at Virginia Tech's football stadium by cheering after the Hokies scored a touchdown. 
 
Lough says Ward loved people -- ""and the people loved Adam Ward."" 
 
11:30 a.m. 
 
With mourners packing the modern, massive First Baptist Church, the funeral of slain WDBJ-TV cameraman Adam Ward is underway in Roanoke. 
 
Five pews at the front left of the church were reserved for the family. WDBJ employees filled eight pews on the church's front right side. 
 
A wreath of Virginia Tech orange and deep red flowers was draped over Ward's closed casket. He graduated from the school in 2011. 
 
Behind the altar, an 80-member choir in white robes and a 10-member string section waited to perform as an organist played hymns before the funeral began. 
 
Three stories up in the balcony, a two-man production crew adjusted sound and light boards. 
 
5:20 a.m. 
 
A funeral is set for a 27-year-old television cameraman who was fatally shot along with a station reporter. 
 
Adam Ward's funeral will be held Tuesday at First Baptist Church in Roanoke, Virginia, a few miles from where he worked. 
 
Ward and WDBJ morning reporter Alison Parker were gunned down by a former co-worker on live television during an interview Aug. 26. 
 
On Monday, Ward was remembered at a reception at his high school for his infectious personality, youthful enthusiasm and rabid love for alma mater Virginia Tech. 
 
In his open casket at the Salem High School auditorium, Ward's body was dressed in a Hokies cap and white shirt.

Archant 
   
Two Oxford photographers will be joined by the Cuban photographer Juan Manuel Cruz del Cueto in an exhibition to be staged at St John’s College in St Giles, Oxford, 10 October 
  Castro’s Cuba 
One of the last vestiges of the Cold War - the stand-off between Cuba and the United States- came to an end this autumn with Cuba and the Unites States resuming diplomatic relations. 

This October also sees the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Cuban communist party. 

To mark these events, two Oxford photographers will be joined by the Cuban photographer Juan Manuel Cruz del Cueto in an exhibition to be staged at St John’s College in St Giles, Oxford. 

The Oxford exhibition – Castro’s Cuba – Hardship and Opportunity - opens on October 10th  Cuba’s Independence Day. It will be open to the public until October 24th. 

The Oxford photographers Uwe Ackermann and Robin Laurance have both travelled widely in Cuba, facing challenges that only Cuba can present.  Their work shows a side of Cuba rarely seen by tourists.  Laurance is an established photojournalist and the Founding Director of the Oxford Photography Festival. He lives in Summertown. 

Ackermann is a Professor Emeritus of Physiology who followed Castro’s example of arriving for his first visit to Cuba by boat. (The two Castro brothers famously arrived by motor yacht with their fellow revolutionaries in 1956.)  Ackermann, an experienced sailor and photographer, lives in Botley. 

Juan Manuel Cruz del Cueto has documented areas of Cuban life only accessible to insiders. He has worked with the UN and UNICEF and has gained special permission from the Cuban authorities and the British Home Office to visit Oxford during the exhibition. 

Castro’s Cuba  -  Hardship and Opportunity  will be at the Barn Galleries, St John’s College from October 10th – October 24th.    Opening times :  10.00am – 4.00pm.  Entry is free. 

Photographs from the exhibition will be available to the media prior to the opening. 

Juan Manuel Cruz del Cueto will be available for interviews during the first week of the exhibition.

3286,"Jeremy Corbyn’s call for the Ministry of Justice to drop its bid for a Saudi prisons contract centres on the case of pro-democracy protester, Ali Mohammed al-Nimr, who has been sentenced to crucifixion. Nimr is facing a death sentence handed down when he was 17 and is largely based on a “confession” he was forced to sign following what he says were days of torture while in custody. The sentence will be carried out in jail by the Saudi prison service. Corbyn called on the British government to protest against this sentence by dropping its bid for a £5.9m contract to provide prison expertise to the Saudis.
The bid was put in by Justice Solutions International, the commercial arm of the MoJ that was set up by the last justice secretary, Chris Grayling, to sell its expertise in prisons and probation – including in offender management, payment by results, tagging and privatisation – around the world. Last month the new justice secretary, Michael Gove announced that he was closing down JSI, telling MPs it was because “of the need to focus departmental resources on domestic priorities”. But Gove said the bid for the Saudi contract to provide “training-needs analysis” would go ahead because it is so far advanced that the financial penalties for cancellation would be detrimental to the British government’s interests. “All work relating to this contract will be completed within six months of starting,” he said. The official explanation was later amended to exclude the issue of financial penalties, and a correction made to the parliamentary record. But the justice ministry still says that it would not be in the “wider interests of the British government” to withdraw the bid at this late stage. This is taken by campaigners, such as Reprieve, to mean that the Foreign Office is insisting it goes ahead. In a statement last Friday, the FCO said: “We understand that Ali Mohammed al-Nimr’s legal process has finished and his final appeal has been denied. We will raise this case urgently with the Saudi authorities.” The spokesperson added: “The abolition of the death penalty is a human rights priority for the UK. The UK opposes the death penalty in all circumstances.”
Downing Street said the UK had already raised Nimr’s case with the Saudi authorities and Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, would raise it again with his Saudi counterpart. The initial JSI bid to the Saudi authorities for the contract was made in August 2014 with a final bid being submitted this April. It is subject to final approval by the Saudi ministry of finance. Maya Foa, of the anti-death penalty group Reprive, wrote to Gove asking him to drop the bid. She said: “Britain’s justice system has a strong reputation for fairness and decency and we believe that to continue with this contract would sully that reputation, while sending the signal that Britain condones the abuses taking place in the Saudi system, and others like it around the world.”",4ac72dee-8595-42bd-8895-3653be9eac65,Blog,2015-09-29T16:35:43Z,UK news | The Guardian,The UK interest in Saudi prisons – and why Corbyn opposes it,1.0,Blog
2434,"New Delhi, Sept 22: There appears to be no solution in sight where the fate of the Karnataka  Lokayukta is concerned. Justice Bhaskar Rao, the Lokayukta has been on leave for the past two months and there have been allegations that he has not deputed his work to anyone else. 

Read more:  Does Karnataka Lokayukta have moral right to probe corruption? 

The Lokayukta's office is facing corruption charges and to add to it the son of Justice Rao has been accused of making extortion calls using his father's name. Former Lokayukta of Karnataka, Justice Santhosh Hegde says, ""enough is enough."" 



In this interview with OneIndia he says that the time has come to arrest the Lokyaukta for permitting his son to indulge in illegal activities. 

Is there any solution in sight? 

The Lokayukta's office is in disarray and Justice Rao is on leave for the past two months. 
It seems as though the people have gone quiet now. Yes the Lokayukta is on leave for the past two months and he has not deputed his work to anyone. Files are piling up and cases are pending. 

Do you think Justice Rao needs to be arrested? 
Yes, he should be arrested. Section 109 of the Indian Penal Code states that whoever abets a crime must be punished. I feel this should be made applicable here. I want to ask if Section 109 is applicable only to the poor? 

How has Justice Rao abeted the crime? 

Can he deny that he was not aware of what his son was doing? He allowed both his house and office to be misused. 

The investigation shows that call of the alleged extortion were made from the home number of the Lokayukta. Moreover why is on leave for the past 2 months? He himself has admitted that he had been misled. 

The Lokayukta is almost non-functional today. What are your views? 

He cannot think that the Lokayukta is only him, it is an institution. For a person who has been a Chief Justice of a High Court he should have handled this better. 

If you recall the High Court Bar Association had passed a resolution against his appointment as Lokayukta. 

What effect is the absence of the Lokayukta having on the institution? 

The Lokayukta of Karantaka today is in disarray. Files are accumulating and the pendency of cases has shot up. Basically the Lokayukta himself is not present. He is on extended leave and it appears he has not delegated the work to anyone else. 

This is leading to the pendency and files accumulating. Ideally the Upa-Lokayukta should have looked into these cases, but in the absence of any authorization cases are pending and work has come to a virtual standstill. I even get to hear that the administrative work has not been delegated. This is creating problems and also adding to the existing mess. It is a total breakdown and failure of the system. 

Do we need a Lokayukta at all? 
The intention should be to cure the defect and the problem. Shutting down an institution due to corruption allegations against a few is not the solution. Think about all those people who depend on the Lokayukta. That appears to be the problem. None are acting in the right direction. 

Another point I would like to make out here is that if there are rumours of corruption one needs to act immediately upon it by thoroughly investigating into the matter. Do not let issues prolong forever, it never does any good.

741,"By STATE HOUSE NEWS SERVICE 

BOSTON -- Uber, Lyft and taxicab drivers showed up by the hundreds at the State House on Tuesday as lawmakers began to consider proposals to regulate the booming ride-hailing industry, including Gov. Charlie Baker's attempt to thread the needle between protecting public safety and encouraging innovation. 

With the Financial Services Committee preparing to consider four major bills this fall that would regulate so-called transportation network companies like Uber and Lyft, lawmakers are grappling with issues ranging from making sure for-hire cars are adequately insured to ensuring that drivers present no threat to the public. 

Public Safety Secretary Dan Bennett, testifying first on Tuesday, told members of the committee that Baker's bill would impose ""one of the strongest state level background checks in the country"" among states that have tried to regulate the smartphone-driven industry. 

The bill (H 3351) proposes a two-part background check for drivers, including a national check done by the company and a comprehensive state check that would include a criminal and sex offender registry check, as well as driving history. 

""No other state has adopted this type of belt and suspenders system,"" Bennett said. 

While Bennett emphasized safety, Assistant Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Entrepreneurship Katie Stebbins said Baker's bill was also ""pro-business, pro-consumer and pro-innovation.Advertisement "" ""Disruption is a hallmark of innovation,"" Stebbins said. The governor's bill, she said, seeks to level the playing field while also avoiding the type of overregulation, like pricing controls, that could stifle growth in the industry. 

In addition to background checks, Baker's bill would require Uber and Lyft drivers to have a minimum $1 million insurance policy for death, injury and property damage that would kick in only when the driver had their app on, was driving to pick up a customer or had a passenger in the car. It will be up to the companies themselves how much of the insurance costs the drivers will have to shoulder. 

Because the TNC drivers use their personal vehicles for commercial purposes, the administration said it was important to distinguish between when the car was being used for business and personal use. The hybrid insurance product, which is currently sold by a company in Virginia, exceeds the requirements for taxi drivers, officials said. At least one company has proposed selling a similar type of policy in Massachusetts. 

Uber and Lyft drivers, wearing blue and pink T-shirts respectively, packed the grandstand of the Gardner Auditorium where the air was thick with humidity. Cab drivers wearing yellow T-shirts filled the lower seating area, and periodic cheers and boos erupted from both groups as lawmakers and the administration discussed the proposals. 

Uber and other groups, including Associated Industries of Massachusetts and the Massachusetts Technology Leadership Council, are supporting Baker's bill as opposed to separate legislation filed by Rep. Michael Moran and Sen. Linda Dorcena Forry, both of Boston, that would impose stricter regulations on the ride-hailing services. 

The Moran-Forry bill (H 3702) would, among other things, require a system of fingerprint background checks that Bennett said would be too ""cumbersome"" to implement. The Moran-Forry bill also encourages some oversight of Uber's ""surge pricing"" system, which charges passengers higher rates at peak hours to encourage more drivers to meet the demand. 

Baker officials said the state should not interfere with pricing, but rather allow consumers and the market to police itself. 

Angela O'Connor, chairwoman of the Department of Public Utilities, argued in favor of giving the regulatory oversight to the DPU, which currently regulates other commercial drivers, and said broad regulatory authority would allow the DPU to respond in the future to a rapidly changing industry. 

The department envisions starting with five new employees to oversee background checks and other functions, and would plan to purchase a database to track permitted drivers. Funding for oversight would come from an assessment on the transportation network companies. 

As lawmakers probed the rationale for the insurance and background check recommendations, Rep. James Cantwell, a Marshfield Democrat, raised the issue of car markings as he described a constituent who had strangers jump in his car at the airport thinking it was an Uber. 

Baker's bill does call for cars to be marked, but Bennett did not elaborate on what that would look like. 

Rep. Shawn Dooley, a Norfolk Republican, also raised a concern about the proposed five-day window for the DPU to perform its background check on new drivers. If the state check is not finished in time, the driver would be provisionally approved to start driving, Bennett said. 

Dooley said he wanted to see a policy where the driver could be provisionally disapproved if something out of the control of the DPU prevented them from completing the background check. 

""I don't care if it's a one-in-a-million chance, I don't want that guy out picking up my daughter from college,"" Dooley said. 

Before the hearing, taxi drivers from the Greater Boston area congregated outside the State House to make their opinions known. 

Eugene Larrame, who said he has driven a cab in Cambridge for 33 years, was one of about 15 drivers wearing yellow T-shirts that said ""I'm a cab driver and I vote"" on the back. 

Larrame said the state allowing ""transportation network companies"" like Uber and Lyft to have free reign is similar to a parent allowing one child to run wild. 

""Let's say you have four or five kids. One of them, you let them do whatever they want. What is going to happen, are you going to have a good kid?"" he asked. ""Probably not. It's the same thing happening here."" 

During a radio interview on WGBH Tuesday, Attorney General Maura Healey outlined her general considerations. 

""I think that today's discussion, debate is really important,"" she said. ""Look, this is a new industry, it is part of the new on-demand economy and, you know, as with any new sort of industry it is going to take some time and conversations and dialogue to figure out sort of the best path forward here. I know the Baker administration has put forward legislation and there are a few other bills out there pending. It's a really good discussion."" 

Healey added, ""First public safety should be protected. We want to make sure that as people use this service or are picked up by Uber or Lyft drivers that their public safety is protected and ensured . . . It speaks to background checks and measures such as that and it also is important that consumers are protected and that's what some of the discussion has been about. But, you know, I welcome the discussion and I'm looking to learn more, it's obviously not an area the attorney general has any direct oversight or regulation of and I think it's important."" 

Asked by Boston Public Radio host Jim Braude why she couldn't issue ride industry regulation, like she did with e-cigarettes, Healey said, ""This is a power and authority that exists within the Department of Public Utilities actually, a different state agency and I respect that. I respect the work of the Legislature and their efforts to engage in this discussion and debate. Look, it's not just here in Massachusetts, it's a debate, it's a discussion that we've seen nationally and as I said, I'm looking to learn more."" 

Healey said she's used Uber and Lyft and likes both services.

3433,"Ange Postecoglou delighted with performance as job done with minimum of fuss   Socceroos vs Bangladesh, by numbers 

Socceroos coach Ange Postecoglou's fears that his team might have been disrupted by the row between the players union and the FFA that had provided much of the mood music in Perth this week proved unfounded after Australia put an outclassed Bangladesh to the sword on a balmy evening in Western Australia. 

The Socceroos ran out 5-0  winners of their second World Cup qualifying match on the road to Russia 2018, Postecoglou springing a surprise by leaving captain and talisman Tim Cahill on the bench. 

For once they didn't need the former Everton man's golden touch as Mat Leckie, Tom Rogic (two), Nathan Burns and Aaron Mooy filled their boots against opponents who might have provided more resistance had both teams changed into cricketing whites and opted to play a Twenty20 match instead. 

Still, home crowds love winners, and at the very least the Socceroos gave a capacity Perth crowd plenty of fond memories to hold on to should there be another ten year gap between international appearances in the city. This was, after all, the first time Australia had played there since defeating Indonesia 3-0 a decade ago. 

As a contest this was all over inside ten minutes. 

By then Australia was already 2-0 up against an opponent whose inadequacies were manifest. 

It was clear that whatever else he was going to get out of this match, Postecoglou wouldn't learn an awful lot he didn't already know about his players ??? aside, perhaps, from their ability to lairise and put on a show with the game won so easily and so early. 

Not that there was a lot of lairising. Postecoglou demands a high-tempo workrate, an energetic pressing game and a ruthless approach to whoever his side his playing, so for him its business as usual no matter the state of the game. 

Any idea that Australia might go soft on their South-East Asian neighbours once the game was effectively settled was quickly dispelled as the men in yellow sought to add to their tally with every forward foray. 

Australia would not have played many more one sided games than this one. Goalkeeper Adam Federici spent most of the first period as the only player in his half of the field, and so keen was he to get a touch of the ball that he was pushing up almost to the half way line. 

His hopes were in vain however, as the Socceroos looked to score every time they got possession. 

This was a perfect opportunity for Tom Rogic to ease himself back into the national team. Making his first appearance since being dumped on the eve of the World Cup through injury, the languid Celtic playmaker needed little encouragement to shake off the disappointment of Brazil and show why such high hopes had been entertained for him. 

He didn't disappoint, netting twice in the first half ??? once from a shot from inside the penalty area, the second from an effort which was deflected in, after which he looked slightly embarrassed. 

But he impressed more with his zest for the contest and his desire to take on opponents and play combination passes with the likes of Massimo Luongo and Aaroon Mooy, the Melbourne City midfielder this time given a chance to start a match. 

In almost every other game he will play Rogic will face sterner opposition, but he showed in the first half how important a creative outlet he can become for the national team if he can remain fit and in form. 

Cahill is a massive presence around this squad, but for once he wasn't needed. In fact Leckie gave a more than passing impersonation of the Socceroo legend, hanging in the air and providing an aerial threat every tme the ball came in high from the flanks. 

Leckie had only ever scored once for Australia going into this game, but he doubled his tally with the Socceroos opening strike in the sixth minute, when he tucked home a shot from a cut back by Luongo. 

He went close on a number of occasions in the opening period with headers and shots, and it was a header from him which led to Australia's fourth goal in the 28th minute as Nathan Burns pounced on the rebound from Leckie's effort after it was fumbled by Bangladesh goalkeeper Sahidul Alam. 

Bangladesh clung on until the interval and Australia failed to add to their tally until just after the hour mark when Mooy unleashed a 20 metre drive which powered past Sahidul to make it five for the night. 

Rogic and Leckie made way for Cahill and exciting youngster Chris Ikonomidis almost immediately, Cahill refusing to take the captain's armband from Mark Milligan, who had worn it in his stead. 

Ikonomdiis nearly got off the mark straight away with a header from a Jason Davidson cross that thumped off the bar. 

But for all of their possession and all of their dominance the Australians could not add to their tally in what was for them a disappointing half compared to the fireworks of the first period. Jackson Irvine, another new face, went close with a header off the woodwork and then blasted just wide, but the 19,495 strong crowd, the biggest ever for a soccer match at nib Stadium, had to be content with their five goal lot. 

Australia will in all probability face a much sterner test in Tajikistan next Tuesday night.",bd0ae4a1-4270-43d6-802a-2a15bdcef040,News,2015-09-03T14:27:38Z,The Land Australia,Socceroos cruise past outclassed Bangladesh,0.0,News
888,"Britain needs to make a bold gesture similar to Kindertransport to help address the humanitarian crisis engulfing Europe, the former chief rabbi has said. Jonathan Sacks said it was time for human compassion to triumph in the same way as the scheme that saved thousands of Jewish children before the second world war broke out. He said that a “very clear and conspicuous humanitarian gesture, like Kindertransport” would help to achieve that aim. “Europe is being tested as it has not been tested since the second world war … The European Union was created as a way of saying that we recognise human rights, after the catastrophe of two world wars and the Holocaust, and it’s very chilling to see some of these scenarios being re-enacted,” Lord Sacks told BBC2’s Newsnight on Thursday. Related: Cameron bows to pressure to allow more Syrian refugees into Britain He believes that the UK could accommodate 10,000 displaced people: “It’s a figure to which Britain would respond. The churches, the religious groups, the charities would all join in, and I think we would be better for doing that.” Meanwhile, former home secretary David Blunkett said the UK had a moral obligation to take about 25,000 refugees – which was still a fraction of Germany’s total. “We should concentrate on those coming through Turkey, who have been persecuted and ejected from Syria, and we should concentrate on women and children,” he said. While a global response was needed, Blunkett added: “If we are going to be taken seriously by anybody as a nation in putting that programme together, we are going to have to face the challenge of taking refugees in very large numbers ourselves.” Oxfam chief executive Mark Goldring said: “Offering to resettle 10,000 Syrian refugees would bring the UK in line with other European countries who have already shown leadership in offering a haven to vulnerable refugees.” He said he hoped that the government would clarify as soon as possible the number of refugees from Syria the UK would resettle and by what date.",186ff6d3-65ad-4461-98c1-eccb26ca8ecc,Blog,2015-09-04T00:19:39Z,Politics | The Guardian,"UK must emulate Kindertransport to aid refugee crisis, says Lord Sacks",1.0,News

5196,"A suicide bombing in a Shiite Muslim mosque and a car bomb blast outside killed at least 35 people in Yemen’s capital and injured more than 100 on Wednesday, officials said, and Sunni Muslim Islamic State militants claimed responsibility. The carnage came amid the continuing campaign of airstrikes by a Saudi-led military coalition, now in its sixth month. Bombardment and ground clashes have killed more than 4,500 people, about half of them thought to be civilians. Dozens killed amid airstrikes and fighting in key Yemeni city Zaid al-Alayaa and Laura King Fierce fighting in the crossroads city of Taizz in Yemen killed dozens of people, officials and aid groups said Friday, with airstrikes by a Saudi-led military coalition and shelling by Houthi rebels blamed for deaths. Fierce fighting in the crossroads city of Taizz in Yemen killed dozens of people, officials and aid groups said Friday, with airstrikes by a Saudi-led military coalition and shelling by Houthi rebels blamed for deaths. ( Zaid al-Alayaa and Laura King ) Sana, Yemen’s capital, remains under the control of Shiite-rooted Houthi rebels, although the Saudi-led coalition has managed to wrest some territory from the insurgents in recent weeks.
Wednesday’s attack, which took place during evening prayers at a mosque in the Jiraf district near the international airport, came hours after unknown assailants killed two Yemeni Red Cross workers in an attack north of Sana.
The car bomb was apparently timed to kill and maim would-be rescuers arriving at the scene, said Tamim Shami, a spokesman for the Ministry of Health. As darkness fell, searchers were still digging in the rubble for bodies or survivors. cComments Got something to say? Start the conversation and be the first to comment. Add a comment 0 The claim of responsibility by Islamic State, which considers Shiites to be heretics, was circulated on social media. Both the extremists of Islamic State and militants of Yemen’s Al Qaeda affiliate have sought to consolidate their strength as fighting between Houthis and pro-government forces has raged across the country. Officials called urgently for blood donations, as hospitals are desperately short of blood as well as vital medical supplies. A witness who was close by when the twin explosions occurred described a nightmarish episode, with injured and bloodied worshipers staggering out of the ruins of the mosque only to be caught up in the second blast.
“When the first explosion happened, people and ambulances rushed to the area,” he said. “And moments later we heard another explosion.” At least two ambulances were destroyed by the car bomb, he said.
Earlier Wednesday, several civilians were killed and injured in airstrikes not far from the site of the mosque bombing, apparently aimed at Houthi targets in the capital, including an air base, officials and witnesses said. Human rights groups have repeatedly denounced combatants for indiscriminate attacks in densely populated civilian areas.
Heavy fighting also continued in the crossroads city of Taizz, south of the capital, while in the southern port city of Aden – seized by pro-government forces this summer – a military officer was assassinated, the fourth such killing in three days. The coalition led by Sunni Muslim-dominated Saudi Arabia is trying to restore exiled President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi to power and shatter the Houthi rebel movement, which it considers a proxy of Shiite Iran. Hadi fled Yemen nearly six months ago as rebels closed in on Aden, where he had taken refuge after Sana fell to the Houthis.
Special correspondent Al-Alayaa reported from Sana and Times staff writer King from Cairo.

748,"Students demonstrate an eco-friendly farm at the 'Solve for Tomorrow' National Youth Scientific Innovation and Experiment contest in Beijing. [Photo/Provided to chinadaily.com.cn] The use of wood pulp for paper making has long been a threat to forest preservation but an innovative idea from Chinese college students might offer a solution.

The technology of making paper from processed poultry feathers became a focal point at the regional final of the 2015 ""Solve for Tomorrow"" National Youth Scientific Innovation and Experiment contest for its potential to ease the industry's dependence on forest resources.

Developed by a three-student team from Tianjin University of Science and Technology, the innovation was patented as a ""new invention"" by the State Intellectual Property Office in May and was considered a favorite to win the creative segment of this year's contest.

""The idea just came from our curiosity about where all the feathers from chicken consumed in McDonald's and KFCs go. Then we found they could be useful with fibers available for paper making,"" Zhang Rongqi, a junior student in the development team, told China Daily at the China Science and Technology Museum, venue for the contest.

Feather-made paper has been produced as decorative wallpaper in a trial, while fiber separated from feathers through the new technology could also be used in air-purifying membrane production, said Ou Huajie , another team member.

However, the invention remains far from implementation as it needs further development for mass processing and production, according to the team.

The invention was one of 17 new technologies or ideas reaching regional finals of the contest's creative segment, in which students demonstrated their inventions through 20 minutes of presentation, operation and question and answer sessions with the judging panel, which included renowned scholars, officials and notary officers.

The contest also includes a challenge segment, which requires students to fulfill three assignments – smart transportation, wind power utilization and security protection – by making use of a limited number of tools and resources.",6e4eea64-6018-45bd-b1b8-cc3dd88c1378,News,2015-09-22T14:24:19Z,CHINAdaily.com.cn,Ecological paper-making idea is feather in the cap of students,0.0,News
5671,"Author: M. Govinda Rao, NIPFP 
 
Of the many slogans coined by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, ‘Make in India’ is the most important. It promises to make India an important investment destination. But, like most other slogans, it is important be clear about what has to be achieved — and how — before assessing whether or not the flowery words may come true. 
 

 
India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, also strived to ‘make in India’ by erecting high protective barriers to trade. The policy completely ignored the interests of the consumers who had to put up with inferior products and higher costs. India departed from that unsustainable strategy in 1991. The new slogan should have a different connotation not merely in terms of its tapestry but also real content. 
 
Today, making India an important investment destination requires a systematic approach involving both policies and institutions. The existing systems and processes must undergo significant changes to remove structural rigidities, improve the quality of institutions and infrastructure, and create a favourable climate for fostering technological progress. The distributional coalitions deeply entrenched in the Indian political system will not easily allow such changes. Union policymakers will thus need a clear understanding of what needs to be done and must cooperate with state-level governments to design strategies for this long journey. 
 
The most important intervention for the Indian government is to change the character and quality of the country’s institutions. Indian labour laws, for example, have constrained labour-intensive industrialisation and led to the declining fortunes of labour-intensive industries like textile and leather. But as labour becomes more expensive in China, India can reclaim some lost ground. The union (central) government initiative to give a greater role to state governments is the best way forward. 
 
A critical component of institutional restructuring is administrative reform. The Second Administrative Reforms Commission has made some useful recommendations on governance and economy which, limits the powers of the bureaucracy. Yet given the enormous influence of the Indian bureaucracy, the status quo is likely to continue. Virtually every regulatory system has been captured by retired bureaucrats. As a result, competence has not always been the major criterion for government appointments. Ensuring accountability, reward performance and making competence-based appointments should be the key aims of bureaucratic reforms. 
 
The union government has to take the lead to reform all levels of India’s government. The licence raj (licence rule), in particular, continues to pose impediments in various ways.  Every initiative from the union, state and local levels of government requires numerous bureaucratic clearances, be it starting a business or constructing a house. 
 
India also has a significant infrastructure deficit. Investment in a multitude of infrastructure projects — equivalent to an estimated 8 per cent of GDP — has stalled for one reason or another. These cobwebs need to be cleared. The land acquisition issue is stuck in the political logjam. In the power sector, the major problem is the disconnection between the policies relating to power generation and distribution. On several occasions, the government has bailed out power distribution companies, but political interference and ineffective regulation have continued to paralyse the sector. 
 
To address the infrastructure deficit, the government needs to step up public investment in infrastructure. The central’s government investment budget is worryingly small, but the government has done well to accelerate capital expenditures in the first quarter. Better revenue collection from indirect taxes may also enhance investment spending. But the government must improve the model concession agreements on public–private partnerships. Private investors desire for low interest rates means that the fiscal deficit should be contained to avoid crowding out in capital markets. With this in mind, increasing public infrastructure investment means increasing the tax-to-GDP ratio. 
 
But tax reform is a lengthy process, not a big bang reform. In May 2015, the government passed the Goods and Services Tax reform, which will introduce a consumption tax of 27 per cent in 2016. While the tax reform promises much, compromises and distortions make it unclear how much it will deliver. 
 
Finally, the government should address price controls, which continue to constrain allocative efficiency and productivity. Even after 24 years of liberalisation, the prices of many goods and services are determined through administered fiat rather than the forces of supply and demand. These controls have distorted resource allocations at the macro and micro levels and have proliferated subsidies. The administered interest rate on provident funds places a floor on interest rates — they cannot go lower. And the associated overvaluing of the exchange rate hurts the export sector. 
 
India cannot continue to distort sugar cane prices while also increasing import duties on sugar to protect the sugar lobby and upping the proportion ethanol blended in petrol. Subsidising irrigated water results in the farmers adopting water-intensive crops even when they are not appropriate and subsidising electricity results in depletion of underground water that would otherwise be used for irrigation. Subsidising urea results in the distorted consumption of fertilisers and soil salinity. The examples can be multiplied. 
 
‘Make in India’ will require coordinated reform and bi-partisan support at both the central and state level. This cannot be achieved through a confrontational strategy. Opposition parties have nothing to lose by opposing reform. But the ruling party has the responsibility to adopt a conciliatory approach to build consensus. Without effort from both sides, ‘Make in India’ reforms will not go far .

2868,"Devlin D'Zmura, a tending news manager at DraftKings, a daily fantasy sports company, works on his laptop at the company's offices in Boston. The daily fantasy sports industry is eyeing a breakout season as NFL games begin. And its two dominant companies, DraftKings and FanDuel, are touting lucrative opening week prizes to try to draw more customers as more competitors pop up. September 12, 2015 
So do fast-growing daily fantasy sports companies like DraftKings and FanDuel that offer the games and advertise with the long gambling-adverse pro football organization. But as the lucrative NFL betting season ramps up and advertisements from DraftKings and FanDuel are as hard to miss as an extra point, Las Vegas casinos and sports books are feeling like they're on the wrong end of a double-standard. Traditional sports betting is barred outside a handful of states, including Nevada, but daily fantasy sports is allowed in most of the United States. 
 
Seizing on the disparity, traditional casino operators and sports books are calling for traditional sports betting to be given the same respect. ""Let's just call it what it is. Americans love to bet on sports,"" said Joe Asher, chief executive of sports book William Hill's U.S. operations. ""They both drive interest in the games and they both should be legal, and taxed and regulated."" 
 
The fantasy industry says it's already legal and has no interest in being regulated if it comes with a ""gambling"" label. Even the traditional casino companies and regulators have eschewed the word ""gambling"" until recently, opting for the more antiseptic ""gaming"" instead to describe what they do. 
 
Daily fantasy sports and its defenders point to a 2006 law, the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, that carved out a specific exemption for ""fantasy sports"" well before the concept of daily games versus week-long or season-long were contemplated. Before the rise of daily fantasy sports, the exception was mostly used by top season-long fantasy operators like Yahoo and CBS Sports. 
 
""Thanks to fantasy sports being specifically excluded from laws affecting online sports betting, FanDuel is not illegal in any way. Trust us, our lawyers drive very nice cars so that we can keep it that way,"" FanDuel says on its website as its short answer for the frequently asked question, ""Is FanDuel Legal?"" 
 
Fanduel's long answer is more complicated, noting it doesn't operate in several states where its legality is not as clear. Some regulators and legal analysts have been skeptical of that reasoning because of state laws governing gambling. That's left casinos on the sidelines, wanting to get involved or support fantasy sports but unwilling to invest or risk billions in revenues that come with highly-regulated casino-resorts. New Jersey regulators even gave the go-ahead to licensed casinos to operate their own daily fantasy sports games two years ago, but no one has done it. 
 
""The exception doesn't necessarily get (fantasy sports companies) to where they say it does,"" said A.G. Burnett, Nevada's top gambling regulator, who is working with the state's attorney general to weigh the industry's legality. 
 
The federal law applies to processing payments for online gambling to curb online sports betting and, to that end, allows fantasy sports companies to process transactions. But Burnett said it doesn't pre-empt other laws. 
 
""If a state says fantasy sports is illegal ... the fantasy companies cannot use (the act) as a get out of jail card because it quite simply doesn't apply,"" he said. So far, there have been no prosecutions challenging the sites' abilities to legally operate. 
 
FanDuel and DraftKings responded in a joint statement Saturday affirming their belief that they don't offer ""gambling."" ""We are speaking with gaming industry representatives to educate them on the fantasy sports industry as our products are games of skill; fundamentally separate from, and not competitive with casinos and gaming businesses,"" the statement said. 
 
John McManus, general counsel for MGM Resorts International, said the company that owns several casinos on the Las Vegas Strip has a similar position on fantasy sports as it does with all forms of gambling. 
 
""It is not in the interests of consumers that established gaming companies, which are fully licensed and regulated, are the only market participants that cannot engage in the business,"" he said. No one wants daily fantasy to be shut down akin to prohibition or the likes of Internet poker several years ago, said Daniel Wallach, a gambling and sports attorney based in Florida. 
 
""This is something that everybody partakes in,"" said Wallach, a sports betting panelist at the upcoming Global Gaming Expo convention in Las Vegas, the top yearly casino industry conference. ""It would not be a popular thing to prosecute."" 
 
Traditional gambling companies, though, don't want to risk lucrative gambling licenses by dipping their toes in the fantasy pool, Wallach said. The debate about ""gambling"" versus ""gaming"" often centers on chance versus skill. 
 
""It's more skill than luck,"" said Peter Schoenke, chairman of the Fantasy Sports Trade Association and founder of Rotowire.com, a fantasy sports news website.  ""You win by making good decisions about players. You have to do a whole bunch of work to play the game, let alone win."" 
 
The NFL has agreed. ""Daily fantasy is considered a game of skill and not gambling,"" said Brian McCarthy, a spokesman for the NFL when asked why it's different than traditional sports betting. That reasoning doesn't necessarily fly with Las Vegas sports books. 
 
""What we're doing is a game of skill, too,"" said Johnny Avello, the longtime sports book director at the Wynn Las Vegas. Avello is trying out his own twist on fantasy sports betting on Sunday — bettors can choose between the better of two fantasy teams he's hand-picked. 
 
""So why not just legalize it all,"" he said.

2682,"Kaley Cuoco is divorcing her husband of 21 months. 

					  		     
The 'Big Bang Theory' star has split from her tennis player spouse Ryan Sweeting less than two years after their wedding on December 31, 2013. 

					  		     
A representative for the actress told PEOPLE.com: “Kaley Cuoco and Ryan Sweeting have mutually decided to end their marriage. They ask for privacy at this time. No further statement will be issued regarding this matter.” 

					  		     
The 29-year-old beauty has also deleted all traces of her estranged husband on her Instagram account and unfollowed him across her various social media accounts. 

					  		     
While Kaley is yet to offer any official comments on the impendingm divorce, the comedy star did post a picture of a rather distressed looking puppy on her Instagram account and captioned it writing: “#mood”. 

					  		     
The news of Kaley and Ryan's split comes just a week after the actress revealed her spouse was great friends with her ex-boyfriend and 'Big Bang Theory' co-star Johnny Galecki. 

						  				  		        		    		  		     
Speaking on 'Watch What Happens Live,' Kaley said: “Well, we dated like five years ago, so I think we both moved on. Johnny is actually one of my best friends. It's a situation that ended well. I understand sometimes it doesn't. It could have gone horrible. He's one of my dearest friends and Ryan loves him. Johnny loves [Ryan]. I got lucky.”

The Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Vijender Gupta, on Monday alleged that the Delhi government was converting public utility buildings such as Barat Ghar and community halls into offices of Assembly constituencies in various parts of the city. 

Mr. Gupta said space measuring up to 2,000 sq metres in these buildings was being converted into MLA office. “The booking for marriages and other social functions has been discontinued. There is great resentment among locals. They apprehend that these premises will be subsequently misused for political purposes,” Mr. Gupta said. 

Mr. Gupta said that Barat Ghar in Burari had been allotted for the use of the Assembly constituency office. 

“The community centre of Old Roshan Pura in Najafgarh has been allotted for the constituency. A Barat Ghar in Sangam Vihar has been allotted for the constituency. Office infrastructure like furniture and equipment like computer and fax machines are being provided by the Legislative Assembly Secretariat,” he said. Mr. Gupta said there is already shortage of space for organising social functions across the city. “The Delhi government’s decision has added to the crunch of the suitable space for public functions,” he said.

4013,"Designed by Grupo Arquitectura , this modern family crib known as Dalias House is located in Mexico City. Concrete and steel make up the basic structure of the Dalias House. Glass comes in to offer an openness that helps integrate the outdoors in the interior spaces and create an unbreakable bond between the two. Imported furniture and automated electrical systems compose both visual and technological appeal. A comfortable ambiance reigns inside. Outdoor spaces are what give this house the feeling of freedom. 

The first impression fails to showcase the connection between interiors and outdoors, as the closed volumetric architecture focuses on the importance of home privacy, as well as space orientation. 



Photos by Agustín Garza show two separate limestone volumes that shape the 11,840 square foot home. These two separate geometric volumes have been imagined to be almost closed to the street. The transparency of this house was aimed at the garden, making the family feel safe and allowing them to have both privacy and openness. 

The main lobby keeps all spaces connected. From this central spine, the flow between the rooms all guide your steps to the garden. Terraces facing south and west capture and draw natural light deep inside the home. Imagined to be both suited for sunshine-filled days when you want to spend time by the pool but also have some shade inside, when you decide to call it a day, aluminum sunshades were mounted on top of floor-to-ceiling windows . 



Beige limestone, black granite, leather, all these are textured colors that can be found inside this modern family crib. Pops of color were embedded through furniture and furnishings, but the largest color splash is the green garden. Neutral colors shape a versatile environment that can become a joyful opportunity to decorate as they please. 

Sustainability features ensure owners have a constant pleasurable environment. Optimal space orientation, solar cells heating the pool water and domestic use and radiant heating, alongside recycling wastewater for irrigation and water purification filters maintain a balance in the house’s environmental responsibility. Check out the 10 of the hottest green technologies for an in-depth look at what modern homes flaunt these days.

678,"The trial of former Hey Dad! star Robert Hughes was not fair because he was the subject of ""poisonous and vile"" social media posts, the NSW appeals court has heard. The trial of former Hey Dad! star Robert Hughes was not fair because he was the subject of ""poisonous and vile"" social media posts, the NSW appeals court has heard. Hughes is appealing against his conviction and sentence for sexual and indecent assaults on young girls in the 1980s, arguing his trial was a miscarriage of justice.

NSW District Court Judge Peter Zahra sentenced Hughes to a non-parole period of six years, with a maximum term of 10 years, after a jury found him guilty in April last year.

Hughes' barrister, Phillip Boulten, SC, told the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal on Monday that the trial miscarried in part because of pre-trial publicity and commentary on social media.

""This was a case where there was ... poisonous vilification of [Hughes] not by mainstream media, but by very persuasive social media that involved the most poisonous and vile publicity from which no one could ever recover.

""There was a deliberate attempt made by people on social media to poison the well. A lot of the material that was published [was] deliberately contemptuous.""

Mr Boulten said there were social media posts about Hughes, which received ""millions and millions of views"".

Many of the posts were designed to vilify the actor, and did so, the barrister said.

Justice Margaret Beazley, the president of the NSW Court of Appeal, queried whether the court should consider social media posts and mainstream media coverage separately.

""The mainstream media coverage was comprehensive ... that might be one thing that's not unusual.

""Social media is another thing. I think we need to look at it separately at least in the first instance.

""You're going to have to show how social media impacted on the trial.

""One [form of coverage] was likely to trigger the other. Apart from that, I don't know if there was any connection.""

Mr Boulten also gave a detailed history about one of the complainants in the Hughes trial giving paid media interviews in 2010.

The court heard the woman and another prosecution witness gave interviews to Channel Nine's A Current Affair and to Woman's Day magazine, in a publicity deal organised by agent Steve Moriarty.

""[The woman] signed a one-year publicity agreement with him and she was involved in a number of interviews where she received a payment and he received a commission,"" Mr Boulten said.

Hughes, who is in Goulburn jail, did not appear in court for his appeal, and did not wish to be on audio-visual link.

The appeal continues before Justice Beazley, Justice Monika Schmidt and Justice Richard Button.

2001,"(CNN) -- A discovery in a Mississippi bayou is giving scientists a glimpse into a rarely-seen marine species. 

Attracted to the telltale ""swoosh"" sound of a blowhole, a fisherman this week found two stranded pygmy killer whales in Waveland, along the Gulf Coast - far from their natural habitat. 

- USING OUR APP? Click here to watch the video. 

""Very little is known about this species,"" says Moby Solangi, Director of the Institute of Marine Mammal Studies in nearby Gulfport, Mississippi. He told CNN affiliate WLOX that the discovery is like finding so-called ""black boxes"" that give insight and history in to an otherwise mysterious sea creature. 

Even though the animal has ""killer whale"" in its name, it is a member of the dolphin family. Pygmy killer whales also have a very strange body shape. According to National Marine Fisheries Service ""they have a small head with a rounded melon that extends in front of the mouth and there is no discernable beak."" 

The pygmy killer whales were a long way from their natural habitat of deep water in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. Their numbers in the region are estimated at just over 400. They are also located in Hawaii and the Western North Atlantic Ocean. 

The animals were rescued and transferred to the institute, where they arrived disoriented and unable to swim. Blood tests showed the whales were dehydrated. 

In the last few days, their conditions have been improving. The larger pygmy whale is swimming on its own. But the smaller one is being treated for a possible shark bite wound. 

When first rescued, the whales were separated and the smaller one started to panic. But the social animals are now kept in the same pool, as staff and volunteers continue to nurse them back to health. 

""The little one is hugging close to the big one. He always goes in to nuzzle. Always touching him,"" said an institute volunteer.

THE Interview, a movie starring James Franco and Seth Rogen as goofballs that clearly draws on stereotypes about North Korea, is currently circulating in Nigeria and the North Korean authorities wants the National Film and Video Censors Board (NFVCB) to discourage further illegal circulation of the film in the country. They complain that the film is in bad taste and that it promotes terrorism. 
 
In the film that was produced in the mould of the 1988 feature The Naked Gun in which Leslie Nielsen gets in a brawl with the Ayatollah Khomeini, Mikhail Gorbachev, Yasser Arafat, Moammar Gaddafi, Fidel Castro and Idi Amin, a TV host and his producer secure an interview with the leader of North Korea – only to find themselves hired by the CIA to assassinate him. 
 
The North Korean authorities have since lodged a formal complaint to the United Nations where they decried the distasteful nature of the film. They feel strongly that to allow the production and distribution of such a film on the assassination of an incumbent head of a sovereign state should be regarded as the most undisguised sponsoring of terrorism as well as an act of war. 
 
The North Korean Ambassador to Nigeria Mr. Jong Choi had previously lodged compliant with the National Film and Video Censors Board (NFVCB) over the illegal distribution of a film which it regards as provocative and targeted at inciting the assassination of the North Korean supreme leader, Kim Jong-Il. Choi who recently paid a courtesy call to the Board expressed displeasure with the movie, which, according to him, not only misrepresents the strides and developments achieved by his country, but also seeks to portray and instigate negative global opinion against the leadership of the DPRK. 
 
The Ambassador pleaded with the NFVCB to initiate action to mop the movie out of the Nigerian market and also cut the supply source. He revealed that a formal complaint had earlier been lodged at the Nigeria Police headquarters over the issue. He underscored the long-standing friendly relations between Nigeria and North Korea and emphasized the need to deepen existing ties. 
 
In her response, the Director General of the Board, Ms Patricia Bala, informed the Ambassador that as a regulator, the agency had carried out due diligence in investigating the matter and established that the movie in question was never submitted to be considered for distribution in Nigeria and that its illegal sale was within underground markets in breach of the law. 
 
Ms Bala stressed that the rules and regulations guiding the distribution and exhibition of movies in the country frown at any content capable of causing a breach of public order or subjecting any individual or nation to ridicule. She assured the North Korean envoy that the agency had already swung into action against the illegal distribution of the said movie, adding that the monitoring and enforcement operatives of the Board were under clear directives to track and bring those involved to face the full weight of the law.

It was during one of hose heavy downpours of rain we had. Her mother (my mother-in-law) heard it. It was a terrible noise. She looked out the window and saw the car. It was white. But that was all she could see. My wife called the police and made a report. When I came home that night I saw that we were very lucky. Our car was parked in the driveway right next to the fence. But, only the fence was damaged. We wondered what we could do. Later, my wife told me that we had insurance. It covers natural disasters such as earthquakes, fires and floods. It also covers accidents such as this one. Lucky us! We called them and they said to send pictures and a copy of the police report and they will pay. We were very relieved. We thought we might have to pay. And everything was fine until the culprit (the person who did the bad deed) showed up (appeared) at our  door day three days later.

506,"OLDWICK, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 

A.M. Best has affirmed the financial strength rating (FSR) of B+ (Good) and the issuer credit ratings (ICR) of ""bbb-"" of MVP Health Plan, Inc. and its affiliate, MVP Health Service Corp. Additionally, A.M. Best has upgraded the FSR to B+ (Good) from B (Fair) and the ICR of ""bbb-"" from ""bb"" of MVP Health Insurance Company. Concurrently, A.M. Best has withdrawn the FSR of B (Fair) and the ICR of ""bb"" of MVP Health Insurance Company of New Hampshire, Inc. (Bedford, NH). The outlook for all ratings remains stable, except for the outlook on MVP Health Services Corp’s ratings, which was revised to stable from negative. Collectively, all companies are subsidiaries of their direct parent, MVP Health Care, Inc., and are domiciled in Schenectady, NY, unless otherwise specified. 

The upgrading of the ratings of MVP Health Insurance Company reflects its revised strategic role within the group, with greater emphasis on commercial large group business in Vermont. Moreover, significant improvement in operating results has been recorded through mid-2015 and is projected to continue into 2016. 

The outlook revision to stable for MVP Health Service Corp reflects its change in strategic direction, resulting in favorable growth in premium and recent improvement in operating results that is projected to continue into 2016. A.M. Best will continue its discussions with the management team about its revised strategy for this entity, while assessing the capitalization, premium leverage and future direction within the group. A.M. Best anticipates that the parent organization will continue to implicitly and explicitly support the entity to fund its future growth initiatives. 

The rating affirmations of MVP Health Plan, Inc. and its affiliate reflect the companies’ strong brand recognition in New York and well-established network with geographic outreach activities throughout the state, which enhances each entity’s stand-alone assessment as well as the group’s ongoing consolidation of operations and overall sound capitalization. The group gained a larger increase in individual membership due to some carriers not originally being as active in the exchange marketplace. A.M. Best notes that while the group has reported consistent net income over the past three years, it has recorded underwriting losses over the past two years. Management has implemented strategic initiatives to return the group to profitable trends, and through mid-2015, the consolidated operating results have been very favorable. Due to these initiatives, A.M. Best expects the organization to return to its historical level of profitability and maintain a steady growth across its various business lines. The sound but declining level of risk-adjusted capital levels is primarily the result of previous cumulative retained earnings. 

A.M. Best believes that the organization has been pressured by the competitive nature of the commercial market, which is driving significant margin compression on existing and new business. Additionally, the continued shift toward government-sponsored lines of business has been challenging. Moreover, the organization faces continued challenges in the operating performance of its Medicare Advantage business line, which is government-funded and heavily impacted by reimbursement cuts. 

Of note is the considerable contribution of the Medicaid product line to the organization’s consolidated operating performance, driven by strong results produced through its acquisition of the Hudson Health Plan (HHP). In August 2013, MVP Health Plan, Inc. acquired HHP, a Tarrytown, NY-based Medicaid managed care organization. As this entity continues to be integrated into MVP Health Plan, Inc., A.M. Best will continue to assess the ultimate impact of the HHP acquisition on the organization and its overall operations, strategic plans, earnings and capitalization. 

The withdrawal of the ratings on MVP Health Insurance Company of New Hampshire, Inc. reflects management’s decision to exit the New Hampshire market and place its relatively small remaining policies into run-off. The run-off and completion of the withdrawal from New Hampshire is expected to be completed by early 2016. 

A.M. Best believes that positive rating movement is unlikely in the near to medium term. Key rating drivers that could lead to a negative rating action include further deterioration in operating performance in any of its core lines of business, a substantial decline in the consolidated risk-adjusted capitalization or any reimbursement issues surrounding its government-sponsored products. 

This press release relates to rating(s) that have been published on A.M. Best's website. For all rating information relating to the release and pertinent disclosures, including details of the office responsible for issuing each of the individual ratings referenced in this release, please visit A.M. Best’s Ratings & Criteria Center.

401,"Influential Emirati Business Leader And Commentator: ""Iran Deal Goes From Risky To Farcical"" HT: Memri.
At First, ""I Shrugged Off The News"" Of The Secret Agreement ""As A Figment Of Someone's Heated Imagination""
In his August 25 article, Al-Habtoor wrote:
""When I first learned from the news that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had signed a secret agreement permitting Iran to self-monitor at least one of its major nuclear sites, I shrugged off the news as a figment of someone's heated imagination.
""It is inconceivable that the world's nuclear watchdog, known for its professionalism and stringent monitoring, would sign off on something so bizarre – or so I initially believed.
""Iraq, whose nuclear activities, both civilian and military, were dismantled following the Gulf War, certainly did not get off that lightly. Even after years of intrusive inspections, the IAEA under the directorship of Mohammed ElBaradei declined to present Iraq's deserved clean bill of health to the UN Security Council prior to the US-led invasion.
""Yet the Islamic Republic of Iran, that has been spinning thousands of centrifuges to enrich uranium beyond accepted civilian levels and has refused to come clean on its past activities in this sphere, is trusted to inspect itself.
""The IAEA cannot be accused of lacking innovation. Perhaps we will soon see drivers suspected of being under the influence allowed to test their own substance levels. Moreover, given that the ayatollahs, whose mantra is 'Death to America,' are suddenly considered trustworthy, years of negotiations could have been avoided. A simple affidavit signed by the Supreme Leader would have sufficed just as well. Something does not smell right here.""
""The Obama Administration's Claim That The U.S. Was Not A Party To This Agreement"" Is ""Just As Fishy"".
""Just as fishy is the Obama administration's claim that the U.S. was not a party to this agreement specific to the Parchin Military Complex – known as Separate Arrangement II – when it was approved by all P5+1 countries.
""A White House spokesman has confirmed the administration is 'comfortable' with the terms of the confidential side agreement between Iran and the IAEA. Are we to suppose that the IAEA took this dangerous, lackadaisical approach off its own bat?
""According to a leaked draft of this 'Separate Arrangement' divulged by the Associated Press, Iran is bound to provide the IAEA with photographs and videos of the various locations within Parchin, together with environmental samples. The question remains, how can those photos, videos and samples be verified as relating to the Parchin complex – and even if they are legit, who is to know whether or not they have been cherry-picked?
""President Obama's assurances that Iran's activities would be subject to 'unprecedented verification' sound ever more hollow. The IAEA has been barred from this site, suspected of carrying out explosives tests related to nuclear weapons, since 2005 and now it has assented to being locked-out for the duration, which is out of character.""
Like Other UN Bodies, The IAEA Too Is Now Politicized.
""This surrender on the part of the IAEA leads me to believe that like so many other UN bodies, the IAEA is politicized; in this case, it has shaped its usual rock-solid strategies to suit political goals. However it is spun, this does not amount to 'the most robust inspection regime' ever, as touted by the Obama administration.
""The AP news report has been slammed by the IAEA as 'misleading.' However, the agency's Director General Yukiya Amano has not disclaimed the draft's published content. He insisted that the arrangements are in conformity with long-established IAEA practices, while emphasizing that he has 'a legal obligation not to make them public.' One is left wondering why the public, not to mention U.S. lawmakers, are being left in the dark.""
""My Suspicions That Iran Is Being Deliberately Empowered To Fit A Geopolitical End-Game Are Heightened"".
""I have been against this unsatisfactory arrangement with Iran since day one, primarily because of its narrow remit. An acceptable deal would have been conditional upon Tehran ceasing its troublemaking and its attempts to topple governments throughout the region.
""My view broadly reflects the opinions of many of Iran's neighbors, who are rightly fearful that the lifting of sanctions will see Iran's coffers overflowing into the hands of its armed proxies.
""President Obama has repeatedly countered our concerns on the grounds that curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions for 10 years is better than no deal. I did not find his arguments credible then, but now that the existence of secret side agreements have come to the fore, my suspicions that Iran is being deliberately empowered to fit a geopolitical end-game are heightened.
""I would love to know why a country that has been hostile to Western powers and their allies since its inception in 1979 is being so rewarded. Or is this animosity with the West just a farce to fool us?""
""Obama Has Been... Bribing America's Middle East Allies, Appealing To The American People, And Playing The Heavy With Congress To Seal His Deal, To The Point Of Being Unseemly – At Stake Is His Legacy""
""European capitals are eyeing up lucrative trade deals and planning to reopen their embassies in Tehran. Iranian-Russian trade is set to expand exponentially... Iran's oil industry is gearing up to expand production of crude to pre-sanctions levels, which could see already depressed oil prices spiraling to new lows.
""Obama's hard-sell campaign is not working, despite his frequent appearances on U.S. news networks to plug the deal for all he is worth, and his furious lobbying of Congress. He has even resorted to pleading with the American people to press their Congressional representatives to vote 'yes,' but is making little headway. A recently released CNN/ORC poll indicates that 56 per cent of Americans want Congress to reject the deal.
""Just about every Republican presidential hopeful – with the exception of Jeb Bush who is on the fence – vows to undo the deal and re-impose sanctions; most of their Democratic rivals are trying to distance themselves from the topic.
""Congress has 60 days to put the issue under a spotlight and is set to vote early next month on a 'Resolution of Disapproval.' If the vote fails to go in the President's favor, in theory Congress could prevent him from lifting sanctions against Iran. Obama has threatened to use his veto, risking putting the White House and Congress on a war footing. It will take a two-thirds majority in Congress to override that veto.
""President Obama has been browbeating and bribing America's Middle East allies, appealing to the American people and playing the heavy with Congress to seal his deal, to the point of being unseemly.

""The Mullahs Have Gone From Zero To Hero In The Blink Of An Eye""
In his August 31 article, Al-Habtoor wrote: ""The ink hardly dried on the Iran nuclear deal before European countries were racing to seal trade deals and reopen embassies. The mullahs have gone from zero to hero in the blink of an eye. Forgotten are Tehran's links to terrorists, attempts to overthrow Middle Eastern governments and mass gatherings organized to hurl insults and threats at the West.
""Cast aside are concerns about Iran's suppression of minorities, its dismal human rights record or its practice of stoning women. I believe Iran has made no substantial statements to the effect it is willing to change. On the contrary, its message throughout has been one of defiance. It has not been required to denounce terrorism let alone its participation in terrorist acts.
""Iran's crimes are suddenly of no consequence to Europe's democracies; I believe they have purposefully put their blinkers on and are literally queuing with their hands out to beat down Tehran's golden doors. All they see now are flashing neon dollar signs. The Islamic Republic, soon to be flush with an $80 billion plus bonanza, is destined to become Europe's latest cash cow.
""I was extremely disappointed and saddened at Britain's rush to reopen its Tehran embassy that has been closed for four years subsequent to coming under mob attack in November, 2011. I have always had great respect and admiration for the UK that I consider my second home, based on my homeland's historic ties and the principled stances taken by great leaders like Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher, who kept the 'Great' in Britain, politically, militarily, industrially and economically.
""I cannot imagine that those prime ministers, whose names remain engraved on world history to this day, groveling before a country that five minutes ago was their enemy, just to get their clutches on a fistful of dollars.""
""Iran's Crimes Are Suddenly Of No Consequence To Europe's Democracies; They Have Purposefully Put Their Blinkers On"" ""The UK's Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, was the first to beat a track to Tehran since 2003. Naturally, he arrived with a trade delegation and took the opportunity to stress the 'huge appetite' shown by British business to invest in Iran as well as the readiness of British banks to finance deals.
""As the Iranian network Press TV has reported, Iran has recently hosted 'a delegation of government ministers from Italy,' who has signed a Memorandum of Understanding to fund industrial, construction and infrastructure projects worth over 3 billion euros. This comes on the heels of a visit by Germany's Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy, Sigmar Gabriel, with a team of manufacturers, as well as visits from Austrian, Serbian, Swiss and Azerbaijani government officials. Spain is also champing at the bit to board the gravy train.
""Moreover, President Hassan Rohani has been invited to visit Rome 'in the coming weeks'. Rohani's red carpet travel schedule is getting fuller by the day. Following a visit to Tehran by France's Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Development, Laurent Fabius, accompanied by business leaders, he has been invited to visit the Elysees Palace in November. Russia and China, which have always been cosy with Tehran, are waiting in the wings with lucrative energy and weapons contracts at the ready.
""No doubt President Barack Obama is rubbing his hands together awaiting his turn to get in on the action, delayed by pesky lawmakers who refused to take his word that his deal is the best thing that has happened since the invention of the wheel.
""Iran and its Lebanese proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah, have not changed. Nevertheless, America inexplicably saw it fit to remove those entities from its terror threat list even as it is fighting to preserve Syria's Killer-in-Chief and supporting a Houthi takeover of Yemen.
""At least one senior Iranian official has gleefully announced his country's continued support for 'resistance' groups, which translated means their armed minions and spies targeting Arabian Gulf States. Who can blame Iran's Arab neighbors for being rattled when a massive cache of weapons were recently discovered in Kuwait in the hands of a Hezbollah cell poised to create mayhem and bloodshed!...""
""A 'Grand Bargain' Between The West And Iran Is Unfolding Before Our Eyes"".
""I am starting to wonder whether there is more to the nuclear deal, which permits Iran to carry out self-inspections of its suspect Parchin Military Complex, than meets the eye - especially when there are other secret agreements between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency which the nuclear watchdog is legally bound not to disclose, even to the U.S. and the other P5+1 countries. Believe that if you will!
""In this case, one can only speculate about the existence of other secret arrangements between Iran and the Obama administration that has displayed unprecedented determination to ensure the deal passes muster with Congress and has gone to extreme lengths to persuade America's longstanding Middle East allies to come on board, including invitations to the leaders of Gulf States to weekend talks at Camp David. Likewise, President Obama is trying, unsuccessfully, to bribe the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu into silence with a massive 'military compensation package.'
""The Shah of Iran may have sat on the Peacock Throne, but it is my bet that Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Hosseini Khamenei is strutting around like a peacock these days, his feathers plumped up by European sycophants and endless praise from U.S. officials.
He is getting everything for nothing. Iran's nuclear infrastructure remains intact, uranium enrichment will be ongoing. Opening up some of the country's nuclear facilities, barring military sites, to intrusive inspections for 10 years is just a mere inconvenience paling by comparison with the glittering rewards.
""I warned again and again of the potential of a 'Grand Bargain' being struck between the West and Iran many years ago and now it is unfolding before our eyes. I recall President Obama saying the nuclear deal could possibly lead to normalization of relations with Iran way into the future provided it sticks to its commitments. What is happening now makes a mockery of those cautious words.
""Here is another prediction. Those Western leaders prostrating themselves before the Iranian leadership will live to rue the day. Enriched and emboldened, I believe it is only a matter of time before Tehran strikes at their countries interests because its ideology and hatred for all things western are immutable.
""The Arab World, in particular Iran's closest neighbors, the Arabian Gulf states, must not only be alert to the coming danger, but should take a leaf out of Donald Trump's book by erecting an impenetrable wall in terms of military, surveillance and intelligence capabilities, to keep Iran, its mercenaries and proxies far from our shores. If we are not careful, the West's lust to bolster their failing economies will leave us hung out to dry."" [3]

1632,"This marks the first time a DPO has been used for a desalination project and made the purchase of dividend-yielding shares available to the general public. Profits from the sale of water will be distributed through a dividend to preferred shareholders. ""We can shape the future when it comes to water and this public offering allows professional investors, as well as individuals, to directly participate in delivering a sustainable source of water in California ,"" said Aaron Mandell , Chairman of WaterFX and Member of the Board of HydroRevolution SM . ""Being a part of this water revolution will provide more than just a financial return, it will put California on a course towards water independence,"" continued Mr. Mandell.Â  
 
The DPO is a State of California registered Qualification by Permit (permit #3499), regulated through the Department of Business Oversight. This investment platform enables HydroRevolution SM to sell shares to both accredited and non-accredited investors in California . The company is issuing $10 million of preferred equity and anticipates raising $20 million in debt financing for the construction of the project. In keeping with the company's open source philosophy, participation in the HydroRevolution project is open to the California public and the company will be majority owned by California residents upon close of the campaign. The investment is also open to organizations, foundations and corporations based in California . 
 
The company is offering up to 2,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred stock at a price of $5 per share. The HydroRevolution DPO has several investment benefits, including a fixed annual yield, just like a public stock dividend, and protections that ensure proceeds are only deployed for construction of the plant. The minimum investment in HydroRevolution SM is $2,000 (400 shares) for non-accredited investors and $5,000 (1,000 shares) for accredited investors. The stock is non-voting and provides a 6% annual dividend. Proceeds from the DPO are to be held in a third party managed impound account until the company meets pre-determined conditions. The DPO campaign will run for a period of up to one year, but may be terminated early once the offering has been fully subscribed. 
 
The HydroRevolution SM plant is the first commercial solar desalination plant to be constructed in California . At full scale, the plant will occupy up to 100 acres of land in the Panoche Water and Drainage District and produce 5,000 acre-feet of freshwater per year, enough water to satisfy 10,000 homes or irrigate 2,000 acres of cropland. The system is capable of treating water with greater than 90% recovery rate, isolating salt and mineral by-products for downstream commercial uses. The plant expands on the demonstration project operated by WaterFXâ„¢ in 2013 in the Panoche Water and Drainage District. The expansion will utilize clean, solar energy to treat irrigation drainage water from 6,000 acres of salt-impaired cropland and generate a new supply of freshwater for the district. WaterFX is providing the technology for the project and will service and operate the plant through a partnership with ATSI Engineering.Â  
 
Unlike conventional desalination plants, HydroRevolution SM will not treat seawater; rather it will draw from a replenishing supply of shallow irrigation water, known as subsurface drainage water, which has previously been unusable. Irrigation drainage water is a natural consequence of agricultural activities but poses a serious threat to cropland, wildlife and waterways in the Central Valley as its high salinity content can damage freshwater ecosystems. By treating this source of water, HydroRevolution SM will help farmers solve two difficult problems: obtaining a consistent and reliable source of freshwater and restoring impaired ecosystems. Without this solution, an additional 10% of farmland in California will have to be retired every year to create additional storage for untreated drainage water. 
 
Behind the HydroRevolution SM plant is the Aqua4â„¢ technology, a concentrated solar still developed by WaterFXâ„¢, that harnesses the energy from the sun to produce thermal energy, which powers the distillation process. As the solar receivers capture solar thermal energy, mineral oil is heated and carries thermal energy to the heat pump that optimizes energy efficiency and feeds heat to a multi-effect distillation system (MED). The MED evaporates freshwater from the water source and the condensate is recovered in the form of purified water. The system is capable of freshwater recovery rates higher than 90%, the remaining brine is further treated to isolate salt and mineral by-products and eliminate liquid discharge. 
 
Media representatives can contact Ivy Wisner , teamwaterfx@mercury360.com , (415) 580-3089, for more information or to set up interviews with company representatives Â

* President says limit to Germany's ability to take refugees 
 
* Government defends handling of record influx 
 
* 14 injured after refugees fight at reception center

 (Adds German government reaction) 
 
By Keith Weir 
   
BERLIN, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Germany's president has warned
that there are limits to how many refugees his country can
absorb as it prepares for as many as 800,000 arrivals this year,
showing growing concern even at the highest level over how to
look after so many newcomers. 
 
""We want to help. We have a big heart. However, there is a
limit to what we can do,"" President Joachim Gauck, a former
rights activist in communist East Germany, said in a speech on
Sunday evening. 
 
""Our ability to take in people is limited, although we don't
know yet where those limits are,"" he added. 
 
The comments from the head of state, who has a largely
ceremonial role but whose words carry moral authority, appeared
to be striking a more cautious tone than Chancellor Angela
Merkel who has said Germany can cope with the record influx. 
 
The government declined to respond directly to Gauck's
comments, reflecting political convention, but defended its
handling of the situation. 
 
""The German government and the chancellor are convinced that
protection has to be given to those who need it, whether they
are persecuted for political reasons or fleeing war,"" said
government spokesman Steffen Seibert. 
 
The debate came amid signs of growing tension among asylum
seekers, part of a wave of mass migration into the European
Union from the Middle East and parts of Africa. 
 
Fourteen people were injured on Sunday when a brawl broke
out between two rival groups in a refugee center in the western
German town of Calden, police said. The refugees were being
housed in tents set up on a disused airfield. 
 
A union representing German police officers has suggested
that refugees should be divided according to their religion to
try to reduce the risk of conflict. 
 
Germany has reintroduced border controls with EU neighbors
to try to regulate the flow of people after initially throwing
open its doors to refugees from Syria. 
 
The central government also agreed last week to give its 16
regional states around 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) next year
to help cover the cost of looking after refugees. 
 
""The German government stands by its decision to now
introduce signs of order into the process for the arrival and
the admission of refugees,"" Seibert added. 
 
Merkel's popularity has dropped sharply over her handling of
the refugee crisis, two polls showed at the weekend, indicating
a shift in the mood in the Europe Union's most populous country.

2405,"We’ve been talking a lot about influencers lately – and with good reason. The right mix of thought leaders and valuable content can catapult any integrated marketing campaign into vast new heights and audiences. Finding and connecting with those ideal influencers, however, has always been the challenge.
While there are multiple discovery tools available for influencer marketing research, identifying your influencers is only part of the battle. The next part is reconciling them with your overall program objectives. It’s here that we’ve witnessed disconnects between marketing teams and their executive leadership – and where the need for executive buy-in is crucial for any influencer marketing campaign. Executives may crave big names – chief executives of major industry organizations who may/may not have an active social presence.
Additionally, any influencer marketing campaign should always provide value to your influencers (as well as your brand). In order to get the right influencers on board, it needs to be a mutually beneficial relationship.
As you look to achieve executive buy-in for any influencer campaigns, recognize the pros/cons of social influence as the primary determinant for your research.Seeking High Profile Influencers
Those who venture into the world of influencer marketing may dream of attracting major executives or thought leaders into their campaigns. These influencers may likely contribute regularly to high-visibility blogs like Forbes, Search Engine Watch, or their own personal blogs.
Collaborating with a high profile influencer could add instant credibility to your marketing initiatives, though relying on this metric alone can reduce overall amplification potential.Pros of Collaborating with High Profile InfluencersImmediate access to a large audience, with a variety of audience and traitsInstant credibility for your message with media, press relationsPotential Hurdles of Collaborating with High Profile InfluencersIf social presence is limited, campaign might not have long-term viabilityGetting participation from high profile influencers may be challenging
Availability is the primary barrier for connecting with big names for your content. Assume that most high-visibility influencers are fielding requests like yours every day, and might not have the time to fully dedicate themselves to your program. Again, this is where the value you offer to the influencers you work with comes into play. Do what you can to make it easy for them to participate and clearly articulate the potential value to them for collaborating.Focusing on Socially Active Influencers
When we look to define what makes an influencer, clout definitely plays a factor. But what if we also look for those who trade major publication bylines for frequent social activities?
These are your potential advocates – influencers who already dedicate significant time to foster their social communities. They may or may not have the immediate draw of big name contacts, but they can offer sustained support beyond the initial campaign launch.Pros of Socially Active InfluencersBuilt-in social amplification opportunities with current audienceGreater availability and variety in verticals and messagingPotential Hurdles Working with Socially Active InfluencersOverall reach limited may be limitedMust build credibility overtime without well-known influencers
Building credibility is the main challenge in collaborating with influencers that are socially active but are not high profile. However, they in turn offer greater opportunities for long-term relationships between themselves and your brand.Circle Back to the Objectives
When weighing the decision to prioritize what types of influencers you pursue, it always helps to review the overall program objectives. Is your influencer campaign built around awareness of a major initiative or product launch? Perhaps you may want to consider collaborating with some high profile influencers to add credibility to your brand message.
Conversely, are you looking to build a long-term campaign that dissects industry changes and teaches new processes? In this case, socially active influencers might be advantageous in that evergreen scenario.
What combination of high profile and socially authoritative influences have you found works best for your organization?

David and Goliath: The moment 5ft 3ins British corporal Bob Roberts captured 7ft 6ins Jakob Nacken in World War Two in an encounter that, bizarrely, spawned a successful career on Broadway for his giant German counterpart 

Amid the horrors of World War Two, it was a fleeting moment of comic relief – but a colossal encounter that endures to this day. 

On one side towered a 7ft 6in man mountain who quit his job with an American freak show to join the Nazis. 

On the other stood a 5ft 3in British corporal who, despite his diminutive stature, went on to capture his opposite number. 

It was a humorous David and Goliath match-up that bizarrely went on to spawn a successful career on Broadway, of all places, for the German giant Jakob Nacken. 

Dusseldorf-born Nacken was working in a circus in America when war broke out and returned to the Fatherland to be conscripted into the German Army. 

He may well have been killed when Allied troops, including Corporal Bob Roberts, stormed five pillboxes and gun emplacements near Calais that were pounding Dover with shells. 

But his surrender instead meant he was sent over to Britain as a PoW - and later went on to find stardom. 

His capture by Mr Roberts, then in the Canadian Army, made headline news at the time and was recorded on widely-distributed Pathe newsreel film. 

And the then 38-year-old Nacken later returned to New York to capitalise on this new-found international celebrity. 

He was signed up at first as the world's biggest Father Christmas then broke into the minor limelight of showbiz through the circus - nicknamed 'The Giant Uranus' and appearing at the New York World Fair. 

In 1959, he starred in Ripley's Believe It Or Not on Broadway. 

The tourist attraction - ironically now part of a Canadian conglomerate - showcased unusual acts and exhibits. 

Nacken was billed as 'The Tallest Man On Earth' and named in a roll of honour in Ripley's 'Odditorium'. 

His height was recorded variously as 7ft 3in and 7ft 7in. Confusingly, Nacken's fellow soldiers on the Normandy battlefield told Corporal Roberts he was 7ft 6in. 

The discrepancy might be explained by Nacken's civilian background in freak shows. Circus owners often lied about the dimensions of their tallest, fattest or shortest stars to enhance their popularity.

At least one giant was sacked on the spot when the circus boss found someone two inches taller, archives record. 

Nacken eventually returned to Germany and died 1987 at the age of 81. 

Speaking previously, Mr Roberts, who settled in Britain after the war, said he was 'delighted' when his PoW had finally been identified after so many years. 

He said: 'I never knew his name, only that he was a lance corporal. 

'But he spoke very good English and one of my mates later asked him where he learned it and he explained he used to be in the circus in America.  

'I'm not surprised he made the most out of his height - there couldn't have been many taller than him.' 

Mrs Roberts, now 92, has now been awarded France's top honour 71 years later.  
  
War hero: Corporal Bob Roberts pictured, left, during World War Two and, right, with his Legion d'honneur medal after being awarded France's highest honour for bravery 

He escaped death when a sniper's bullet grazed his temple, survived a shell blast that killed the man next to him, saw an enemy spy shot dead just as she was about to kill him and came out on top of a duel with a German officer.  

Last year, the French government announced it was to honour all living Allied servicemen who helped liberate the country from the Nazis by awarding them the prestigious Legion d'honneur. 

When Bob's granddaughter, Melanie Vass, wrote to the MoD for his medal in April, the application joined a queue of 3,000 others. 

Nothing was heard until this week when the great-grandfather received the award in the post without ceremony. 

Mr Roberts, from Bournemouth, Dorset, said: 'I thought it was never going to come and was a bit surprised when it arrived recorded delivery in the post. 

'But I am glad it has and I feel very lucky and privileged to have it.I just doing my bit in the war and was very lucky a number of times.

Cat, 38, wore the high neck black number with a statement thigh-high split for the red carpet awards. 
 
She teamed it with a pair of silver strappy sandals and scraped her hair back into a chic up-do to let the cut-out dress do the talking. 
 
With a slick of nude lipstick, Cat went for a smoky eyes to add a bit of drama to the look and carried a small black clutch. 
 
Cat’s husband Patrick, 44, proudly walked the red carpet with his wife and held her hand as the parents-to-be posed for the cameras. 
 
She is gearing up for her next big role in life, becoming a mother to her first child . 
 
Patrick shared a photo of the couple, and gushed: “@catdeeley About to walk this amazing woman up the red carpet. #wife nominated #husband already a winner #emmys.”

Cat has been the host for the popular dance show since it kicked off in 2006, and has been nominate four times for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Realtiy-Competition program.

“With our two strong accents, we basically needed subtitles or a UN translator.” 
 
The 44-year-old was also quizzed about when the loved-up pair might add to their family and he replied: “I don’t know. I generally find that when joy like that comes along, it’s a surprise.” 
 
The pair tied the knot at the picturesque St Isidore’s College chapel in Rome in 2012. 
 
Patrick’s parish priest, Father Gary Donegan jetted from Belfast to officiate. 
 
An insider said at the time: “It was a beautiful ceremony, just close friends and family. 
 
“We only found out at the last minute. It was a really perfect day. 
 
“They’ve been pals for ages and we all just wonder what took them so long.”

4739,"It seems like human nature to envy where other people are in life.  Many people envy their friends' financial status, work position or even their prayer life.  When you're healing from narcissistic abuse, you also may envy others who seem to be so much farther along in their healing.  I'm not immune to it- I feel the same way sometimes.

The problem though is there is no good reason to feel that way.  If God wanted you to be in the same position as another person, He'd put you there & nothing could stop Him.  God has you where you are in life for a reason.

So what is the reason?  Honestly, I don't know.  However, I do know that part of the reason is to bless you & to bless others.  I'm not saying God is like a faery godmother, granting wishes.  Instead, He uses things that happen in life, good & bad alike, to help you to learn & grow to be more like Jesus.  And, He uses you to help others to do the same.  Even your mistakes can help others.

I encourage you today, Dear Reader, to stop griping about where you are, & to ask God to help you appreciate the place you're at right now.  Ask Him to help you see the good in it or the good that will come of it.",da121afc-c6e9-48b0-8748-ef6c303c87b3,Blog,2015-09-28T11:03:55Z,CynthiaBaileyRug,You Are Where You Need To Be,1.0,Blog
1236,"CUMBERLAND COUNTY, Tenn. (WVLT) -- The Cumberland County Sheriff's Office have arrested four people after a string of auto burglaries in several counties. 
 
Investigators say Jarod Julies, Douglas Burns, Alex Fagan and Lauren Howard were taken into custody after a month long investigation that spanned from Cumberland County to Knox County. 
 
Several police departments, including the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, recovered several thousand dollars of stolen property. 
 
The investigastion began on August 8, 2015 when several reports of auto burglaries came from the Deer Creek Subdivision. Items stolen included cash, wallets, blue flight suit, handguns and rifles. 
 
On September 6, 2015 more reports came into the Crossville Police Department of auto burglaries in the Deer Creek Subdivision. Investigators observed several videos and found the suspects drove a silver or grey Ford Taurus. 
 
On September 10th a vechicle matching that description was pulled over and the driver was Jarod Julies who was on probation in Knox County for an auto burglary. The car was searched and officers discovered a large sum of cash, marijuana, ski mask, gloves and other reported stolen items. 
 
A search warrant was then executed at an apartment in Ashton Place where more items were recovered. An additional search warrant was issued and the Knox County Swat team and TBI recovered a reported stolen AR 15. 
 
Julies, 24 was charged with theft over $10,000, burglary, vandalism. Burns, Fagan and Howard were all charged with theft of property.

3161,"I spend a lot of time using must-have apps, editing videos and catching up on other work, which means I spend hours in front of a computer. It also means my wrist, back and eyes can start feeling strained if I’m not sitting properly or optimizing my desk space. It’s so important to treat your body right while in front of a screen. Thanks to the sexy world of ergonomics, we now have the techniques (I’ve talked about proper desk posture here ) and the products that can make your workspace very body-friendly. But because we don’t want to sacrifice style as well, I thought I’d take today to highlight some ways to ergo up your desk top so you can prevent premature tech aches and pains. 
 

 
Laptop Stand – The days of desktop computers as our main squeeze are more scarce than ever. We use our laptops as our everyday computer, which tends to have us staring down at the monitor. That’s no good! A laptop stand like this Elago L3 (or even their L4) is perfect for bringing your monitor up to eye level so your neck gets a break (no pun intended). The L3 is so sleek and minimalistic so it’s barely noticeable underneath your laptop–a feature I love so the desktop can maintain an uncluttered appearance. When you use the stand, just make sure your laptop is set a distance from your eyes that keeps you from leaning into your computer, but also not strain your eyes from being too close. 
 
External Keyboard and Mouse - Again, because the laptop is always by our side, it’s REALLY important to use external devices if you’re in front of your computer for extended hours. Using the built-in trackpad regularly can cause severe cramping. A portable keyboard is necessary when you have your laptop raised to eye level–on a stand your arms won’t be able to maintain a 90 degree angle. A great mouse will hold your hand in a more natural position for long-term use. I’m a big fan of even using a tablet because it can act as a mouse and is excellent for my creative projects. Have a little fun with your keyboard and mouse and add a pop of color like the turquoise Topcase USB mouse or Azio HUE pink keyboard (or this rainbow light one ! WHAT!). You can also go ultra sleek with all white like the Apple Magic mouse . 
 
Desk Lamp - The position of your body and how your hands lay aren’t the only concern with your desk, lighting is important too. Screen brightness and the type of light in your office can really cause eye strain. Add a minimalistic LED light to your desk to brighten up your space and give your eyes a softer, but still brilliant light, to highlight your work. Poppin makes such fun and clean desktop items and their Limber LED Task Lamp is no different. Two tips to keep in mind when adding a lamp: set the height around 15 inches above your desktop to help the light spread evenly across your workspace, and place the lamp on the opposite side of your desk than your dominate hand so you don’t cast shadows every time you place your hand in front of the light. 
 
Chair - Remember how, in my posture article , I talked about the importance of a chair that supports your back and adjusts so your feet can touch the ground? So yeah, that’s vital. It will keep you from overcorrecting your posture, leading to more strain, and eliminate any knee issues. A great chair will actually lift up so you’re close enough to the desk that your arms are at a 90 degree angle for typing, but low enough that alone or with the help of a foot stool your feet are resting flat. I tend to switch from on my bed to a comfy desk chair once I realize I’m going to be on my laptop for a prolonged period. This Malta Office Chair is white and bright and a comfy but professional option for dressing up your desk and pampering your body. 
 
Bonus: If you don’t want to invest in an external mouse or keyboard and/or you do and want added support then think about getting a wrist rest to support your wrist better. It doesn’t hurt that Socksmakeover might possibly sell the CUTEST wrist rests ever. Look at this little kitty rest ! This can most definitely be a personality piece–something to think about when decorating your desk .

665,") Richmond, BC -- Consumer’s Nutrition Center , the popular site for supplement sales in Richmond, has announced that Richmond health supplement customers may purchase top-quality athletic supplements. This availability of supplements is consistent with the company’s historical goal of enabling customers to make the healthy choice for themselves. 

“We’ve been selling health foods, vitamins, and supplements for more than 35 years, and we have no plans to stop just 
   
yet,” declares Marvin Steffin who owns and runs Consumer’s Nutrition. “We’ve always upgraded our services to meet the demands of our customers, and making intense work out supplements available for our Richmond customers is a natural progression.” 

Consumer’s Nutrition Center has become a fixture in the Richmond supplement industry, and it is a favorite source of health supplements in Greater Vancouver . The staff offers exemplary advice regarding the types and brands, and the retail price us usually 20% lower than the usual price offered by their competitors. They have also won the Richmond News Reader’s Choice Award for Nutrition a total of 10 times. 

“We offer a wide variety of health supplements online, and by going to our website our customers can find our entire list of offerings.” reveals Steffin. 

Consumer’s Nutrition offers numerous supplements for those who are trying to build muscle. Usually, diet alone cannot offer the necessary nutrients that a muscle builder needs to bulk up. 

“We offer muscle formulas and weight gain products, and we have lots of brands available,” says Steffin. “Muscle builders need a lot of protein, and for them we also offer many different brands of beef proteins, egg proteins, and whey protein isolates.” 

Other work out supplements in Richmond include electrolyte formulas, creatine, glutamine, and BCAA products. These are all available at the Consumer’s Nutrition website. 

“We also offer formulas for natural pain relief in Greater Vancouver ,” says Steffin. “We also provide meal replacements and we even have vegetarian protein for those who only prefer to consume plant life.” 

Of course, vitamins are also available as well. Vitamins are one of the most sought after supplements, and many people are deficient in certain types of vitamins due to their insufficient diet. With Consumer’s Nutrition center, such deficiencies can then be corrected. 

“We have just about every type of vitamin and mineral available at Consumer’s Nutrition,” asserts Steffin. “They come in different forms, and some are even made expressly for children.” 

Detox products and even natural cosmetics are also available at Consumer’s Nutrition for Richmond customers. 

“We believe in providing what the customers need,” says Steffin. “That’s how our company has thrived for more than 35 years.”

608,"Seoul: At the height of the Korean Peninsula tensions last month, South Korean loudspeakers blared propaganda messages across the DMZ to hundreds of thousands of troops stationed over the border in the North. 

Designed to chip away at morale, the taunts infuriated the North Korean leadership. President Park has met with President Xi in China three times! the speakers boomed. How many times has Kim Jong-un met with President Xi? 

The answer: none. 

""If the North Korean people knew that they would probably be quite shocked,"" said veteran China watcher, journalist and commentator Jong-dae Ha, from South Korea's highest circulating newspaper, Dong-A Ilbo. ""I don't think Kim Jong-un was too happy watching that parade."" 

""That parade"" was China's commemorative World War II military spectacular, held in Beijing on September 3. South Korean President Park Geun-hye raised eyebrows as she stood, resplendent in yellow, just a Russian president away from China's Xi Jinping, watching Beijing's conspicuous display of manpower and hardware. 

Park was the only leader of a US ally to attend. That the occasion gave the Chinese an excuse to bring out the good silverware (like the new DF-21D anti-ship ""carrier killer"" missile) so troubled Western leaders, they stayed away in droves. (Australia sent Veterans Affairs minister Michael Ronaldson, also known in China as ""Who?"".) 

North Korea's Kim Jong-un was not at the parade. His envoy didn't even get the front row, let alone a seat near Putin. 

Park's attendance was highly controversial in South Korea, and a curious look for a major US ally. ""[It's] a big puzzle to many even among her supporters,"" says Hyung-A Kim, Associate Professor of Korean politics at the Australian National University. 

In Seoul, everyone has a theory. This is north-east Asia, where an infernal tangle of alliances, frozen hostilities, superpower tensions and historical grievances sits alongside ever-deepening trade flows and shifting power plays. Nothing is simple, and symbolism is important. 

South Korean media chalked it as a victory for Park, not a scoop for Beijing or a rebuff to the US. She was there to press Beijing for its support for Korean unification at a time when Beijing's patience with Pyongyang has run thin. 

That may be so, says Cho Min, from the Korean Institute for National Unification in Seoul. China's longstanding position has been that it doesn't want conflict on the peninsula, and it doesn't want Kim's regime to collapse. Therefore, ""the only help China can give, from our perspective, is by not intervening at all, so we should take every opportunity to explain that to them"". 

It is not clear whether Kim wasn't invited to the parade or refused to go after demands for special treatment were turned down. 

But the China-North Korea relationship has been strained at least since Kim executed his uncle, the former chief China envoy Chang Song-taek, in December 2013. Ha said the problems go back further, to the sudden ascent of the 28-year-old Kim to North Korea's leadership in 2011. 

""From Xi's point of view, Kim Jong-un is just a young man. Park is the same age as Xi and they have shared experiences. So he's probably not the right partner to sit down and have a heart-to-heart with Kim Jong-un,"" said the journalist Ha. 

Park has held six summit meetings with Xi, three of them in China, since she was elected in 2013. During the flare-up of Korean Peninsula tensions in August, the Chinese exerted pressure on the North Koreans to stand down, moving Chinese troops to the North Korean border and letting that be known in the Chinese press. 

""Chinese cooperation was provided to a certain extent, and that is why President Park attended the parade,"" said Ha. 

Further, the South Koreans were pleased that the Chinese chose the occasion of Park's visit to declare a push to resume the six-party talks, a sort of world's-grimmest dinner party where China, the US, Japan, Russia and the two Koreas sit down to try for progress on the denuclearisation of North Korea. The talks have been stalled since 2009 and China, which is the source of most of Pyongyang's food and energy, is considered to have the most sway over the North. 

But Hyung-A Kim points out that China has not changed its basic stance on North Korea; and that US alliance politics looms over this too. 

""Despite China's visibly warm welcome to Park, there was no epoch-making agreement between Park and Xi, just as there was no fundamental change in China's North Korea policy,"" she said. ""She attended the military parade mainly to show the change in her government's diplomatic approach, especially to expand [South] Korea's own diplomatic space by resisting US pressure to turn down the Chinese invitation."" 

Park's attendance may have been ""a hot issue across the world"", said Ha, but there were also many reasons why it was reasonable she was there. The two neighbours have a long history of relations, a quarter of Korea's exports go to China, and China pressed hard for her presence. She also led a huge delegation of 156 business leaders, amid debate among Koreans over whether their economy is too dependent on China. 

Like Australia, South Korea's main trading partner is China and its security guarantor is the United States. Unlike Australia, South Korea doesn't have the luxury of sitting apart from its neighbours.

5493,"MAMER MOTORSPORTS TAKES ON CARNAGE AT INAGURAL LOORRS BAJA RACE ROUNDS 11&12 
Cole Mamer and his team were prepared as they could be as they went south of the American border and pulled into the new Lucas Oil Off Road Race Series course at Estero Beach. The new course was located just miles outside of Ensenada, Baja California. 
 
LOORRS added in the new race course to this season race schedule and as many teams were nervous about taking the series to a new stop, Mamer Motorsports was excited for the change of pace, new fans and a new course to race the #35 Mamer Motorsports Pro-Lite on. 
 
It wasn’t long before the trucks were on the course running down four practices just in one day. The course provided the drivers with nearly a mile long of door to door opportunities to attempt a pass. The key to this course was to stay out of the dust, keep clean through the turns and keep on the gas you went through the rhythm section. 
 

When race day came Saturday, fans were lined at the gate waiting in anticipation to see a new form of off-road racing that hasn’t been to Baja since 2002. The thrill of meeting new drivers, seeing crews work on the trucks and witnessing first hand the carnage that can go into short course racing had the fans on their feet all day. 
 
The Pro-Lite race was the second race of the day and Mamer had to line up at the back of the stacked class after qualifying didn’t go his way. This didn’t stop Mamer though as that green flag dropped he immediately made 3 passes right out of turn one. When a wreck on the first lap brought out a full course yellow the trucks had to restart the race and Mamer had to go back to his original starting position. 
 
The 15 trucks took on the restart and once again Mamer went for multiple passes and pulled it off, this time passing 4 trucks on the restart lap. This was great momentum for Mamer as he let the race come to him. 
 

A dusty course didn’t distract the driver as he battled with Creed looking to take over the 6th place position. The 10 lap race was ticking down and once Creed crashed it moved Mamer up to that 6th place. He was on the tail of DeBerti as they were coming through the rhythm section when he found himself and DeBerti both getting sideways and with a quick reaction Mamer steered out of the way as DeBerti was spinning through the air and wrecking. 
 
Even though Mamer managed to avoid a major accident, his truck didn’t make it out alive as he fell to the back of the pack with broken front end of the truck. Mamer pushed through the rest of the race with a limp truck in 10th, but still was able to salvage some points. 
 

Mamer rounded out the weekend with a 9th place finish in round 12 and will be heading to Reno, NV for rounds 13&14 sitting 10th in points. Reno will provide the racers with many elevation changes, high speed sections and one last chance to really fight for a higher points standing before they head into the final stretch of the season.

3705,"As the Soil Association prepares to launch its annual Organic September campaign, we look at some of the reasons why going organic can help the planet  
As increasing numbers of consumers turn more towards healthy, ethical and local food choices, the Soil Association's annual event, Organic September, is becoming bigger than ever. This year's celebration of all things organic promises to include inspiring events, handy tips, delicious recipes and much more. 
 
The aim behind the campaign is to encourage people to make a small change to their everyday shopping in order to help the planet. From reducing your exposure to potentially harmful pesticides to helping combat climate change and promoting animal welfare, the reasons to go organic are many. 
 
For example, did you know that over 320 pesticides can be routinely used in non-organic farming and that these are often present in non-organic food? By switching to organic food you can be safe in the knowledge that all organic farms and food companies are inspected at least once a year and the standards for organic food are laid down in European law. 
 
Organic farms help to protect wildlife and promote animal welfare too. Organic animals are reared without the routine use of antibiotics which is common in intensive livestock farming, whilst plant, insect and birdlife is 50 per cent more abundant on organic farms. Furthermore, if organic farming was common practice in the UK we could offset at least 23 per cent of UK agriculture's greenhouse gas emissions through soil carbon sequestration alone. 
 
Helen Browning, the Soil Association's chief executive said: ""With wildlife in decline over the last half century, Organic September is a fantastic opportunity to let people know why organic farming is more important than ever. With each small change we make - like choosing organic milk or butter, or switching to organic eggs, we are helping secure a better future for animal welfare, our bees and other pollinators, and of course, our neglected soils."" 
 
The Soil Association is partnering with independent, online and national retailers in the UK to make it easier for people to achieve their small changes. Many businesses have already listed their support, from multiple retailers like Ocado and M&S to well-established independent stores and wholesalers like Wholefoods and Planet Organic, to famers, box schemes, processors and brand new organic businesses. 
 
How you can get involved 
 
During this year's campaign the Soil Association will be running an interactive and social media campaign featuring the Organic 30 list and calendar. This will comprise plenty of tips for easy items to swap throughout the month from swapping to organic milk to brewing an organic cuppa for colleagues. There will also be prizes up for grabs throughout the month as well as offers and promotions to help you buy your favourite organic products for less. Make sure you share your organic tips, recipes and photos on social media using the hashtag #OrganicSeptember 
 
5 ways to go organic this September 
 
1. Switch to organic milk. Organic milk is naturally different - no system of farming produces milk with higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids or a healthier balance of omega-6. 
 
2. Eat less, but better, organic meat. Organic animals enjoy the very highest welfare standards of any farmed animals. They are fed a GM-free diet and graze on organic pasture where pesticides are severely restricted. 
 
3. Switch to organic beauty. There are currently no legal standards for organic beauty so some products may be labelled 'organic' even if it doesn't always stand true. Look for the Soil Association symbol to make sure that what you put on your body is as important as what goes in it. 
 
4. Sign up for an organic veg box. Organic farms support 50 per cent more wildlife than non-organic farms, so you're not just treating yourself to the best of British produce, you're also helping to protect bees, birds and butterflies. 
 
5. Brew an organic tea or coffee. Organic tea and coffee is grown without the use of artificial pesticides and fertilisers. This not only reduces the farmers' exposure in the developing world, it also means healthier soils and more habitats for birds and wildlife. 
 
The themes for each week are as follows: 
 
Week 1 - all things organic (gaining momentum, driving interest) 
 
Week 2 - fresh produce (with a harvest theme, drawing in farming and seasonality) 
 
Week 3 - organic beauty week 
 
Week 4 - dairy and meat 
 
Week 5 - essentials (including store-cupboard supplies)

Did you know? 
By switching to organic eggs, more hens would have access to grassland and not be at risk of painful beak trimming. 
Did you know? 

    By switching to organic bacon or pork, more pigs will keep their curly tail and stay with their mother for much longer.

3701,"LAS VEGAS (KSNV News3LV) – Ride-sharing companies Uber and Lyft are up and running in Nevada. Drivers took to the road for the first time Tuesday, even without the county's blessing. 

Both companies received state approval Monday, but Clark County commissioners said Tuesday they would not be allowed to operate without county granted business licenses. 

But hours after the meeting, Lyft and Uber were online.

Uber said it has more than 1,000 contracted drivers ready to go. They've been screened with vehicles inspected and many more are going through the process. 

News 3 opened up the Uber app to find out how much it'll cost going from our station near downtown Las Vegas to The District in Henderson. It was a journey of more than 18 miles. The 25-minute trip cost $45.66, which included a $1 safety fee.

Uber drivers said the prices can vary depending on factors like traffic, but on the slightly faster trip back at 22 minutes, the total cost was $45.19, just a few cents cheaper.

Uber said drivers get 75 percent of the cut, and a big draw for those like Edgar Barbosa is that you are in charge of your work hours.

""With Uber, I don't miss any more birthdays. I make every anniversary now,"" said Barbosa. 

Lyft is also online. One driver told News 3 he uses both Uber and Lyft for passengers. He said he first started using Uber on Tuesday afternoon. He said in four hours he did 12 rides. Then, he switched over to Lyft. 

We took a ride from the station to the Stratosphere, which is a little over 3 miles. Including the trust and safety fee, it cost $13.80. So how about a taxi cab? We went the same distance and it cost $19.34, but when you add a $3 credit card fee and a 15 percent tip, the grand total was $26.01. That's a $12.21 difference.",03ac7a44-afee-4d6b-8bdf-874eb07354ae,News,2015-09-16T06:38:35Z,My News 3,"News 3 takes test rides as Uber, Lyft begin service",0.0,Blog

4400,"What a beautiful weekend! My boyfriend and I went to his cousins wedding in Exeter. It was such a lovely day even if I ended up drinking a bit too much Prosecco on arrival at the reception! I think this triggered a migraine later in the evening unfortunately so I wasn't able to dance into the night as I had hoped. 
The transition between my old job and new one has left my money situation a bit up the creek so I had no choice but to dig out an old outfit for the wedding, although I did treat myself to a new pair of shoes from M&S! I bought a pair almost identical to the M&S ones from Topshop a couple of months ago but they were so high I couldn't even walk 2 steps in them, I was devastated when I had to get a refund! But to my delight M&S have just brought out a lower more practical pair for cripples like me who struggle with heel height and have knee problems! Amazing!! Plus they were less than a third of the price of the Topshop ones so I was able to afford them with my discount on top! Perks of the job :)! 
M&S have just launched a new advertising campaign called 'the art of' it's a way of creating one message for the business and linking the food and GM adverts together. It concentrates on the way M&S makes clothing and what they offer over other retailers for example this past week has been about 'the art of Comfort' and showcases our beautiful bras which are luxurious and sexy yet incredibly comfortable! The other key message this week is 'the art of boho' and this nods towards the bohemian trend which is a key trend of the autumn season. My wedding outfit was inspired by this trend which is why I put the snakeskin shoes together with a floaty dress and weave bag. It created texture and a friendly clash of prints. The shoes feature in the TV advert as part of the campaign! The weather was ever so slightly chilly so I dug out an old Mac style coat with sheer sleeves to keep me warm! I will keep you updated with the latest M&S weekly campaign highlights, my outfit details are below: 
Outfit Details:
Dress - I genuinely can't remember where this is from as it's so old! 
Mac - Bella Sorella
Shoes - Limited Edition at Marks and Spencer
Bag - Primark 
Belt - Topshop 
The food was absolutely divine!!! 
Stunning location in the sunshine the morning after the wedding..

The flowers from the bridal bouquets were leftover the next day so we jumped at the chance to take some home and replace our usual 'fake' roses with some real beauties! One day I will be able to afford fresh roses for my vase each week!!!

3872,"A Qatari sheikh has fled the US after his Ferrari was caught on video drag racing through the streets of Beverley Hills, California. A Qatari sheikh has fled the US after his Ferrari was caught on video drag racing through the streets of Beverley Hills, California. The canary yellow Ferrari LaFerrari was spotted careening through the manicured avenues of the affluent neighbourhood, neck-and-neck with a white Porsche 911 GT3 on a video posted online earlier this week.

The cars tore through stop signs and zoomed past pedestrians before pulling into a driveway of a Beverley Hills home with engines smoking.

On Thursday detectives revealed the yellow ferrari belonged to Sheikh Khalid bin Hamad al-Thani, but have not confirmed whether he was driving either the Ferrari or the Porsche.

The driver's faces are not clearly visible in the video.

Police officers who attended the residence were unable to make an arrest or issue a citation because they had not witnessed the incident, theLos Angeles Times 

Authorities said they were considering charging the Sheikh al-Thani with reckless driving and other offences, but after the video of the joy ride went viral the Sheikh abruptly left the country.

His cars have also vanished, the LA Times reported.

Dubbed the 'patron sheikh of drag racing', al-Thani is a generous backer of Al-Anabi Racing, giving a reported $US10 million ($14 million) annually to the sport.

A drag-racing team formed by al-Thani won championships in 'top fuel' — the most elite class of dragsters — in 2010, 2011 and 2013.

His official Facebook page is replete with racing videos, trackside photographs, and images of Al-Thani behind the wheel of some of the world's fastest race cars.

The al-Thani family is the ruling house of Qatar, but it is unclear whether the sheikh is a member of the royal family, according to BBC news.

The LA Times reports that authorities said al-Thani had denied he was driving the car and had attempted to invoke diplomatic immunity before he fled.

But a spokesperson for the Beverley Hills police said it was unlikely that person was protected by diplomatic immunity.

""It's against a federal law for someone to claim diplomatic immunity when they don't have it, so we're looking at that and then we're also looking at the reckless driving,"" Beverly Hills Police Chief Dominick Rivetti said during a press conference on Thursday.

Local authorities said that they may look into prosecuting those involved.

Chief Rivetti said al-Thani's status would not play a role in the investigation.

The law would be applied equally regardless of ""who you are, who you know or where you are from,"" he said.

The Qatari consulate has been contacted.

The Youtube video had been seen by over 1.3 million people by 4pm AEST.

The man who posted the video, Adam Bornstein, told the LA TImes that the rich Qatari visitors typically had kept a low profile.

""They've been known to come and stay in the summer with their nice cars. For the most part, they're very laid-back and mellow,"" said Mr Bornstein, a car enthusiast. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.",48258a3d-f4b3-4e48-9c83-5fd3a367732e,News,2015-09-19T13:16:24Z,Penrith Star,Qatari Sheikh flees US after car caught on video in drag race through Beverly Hills,0.0,News

It happens to girls as well as boys, in public places as well as in the safety of their homes. And the impact is severely damaging, often lifelong. 
 
And that’s why we need you. Because every post, every share, every tweet makes a difference! #MMKarma 
 
#FullStop is a campaign to raise awareness on all forms of child sexual abuse. By talking about the problem, you become a part of the solution. Together, we need to end the silence, end the hurt. Full Stop.

ILOILO City – Vice Mayor Jose Espinosa III does not know how to count? 
 
He should not have included himself among the councilors eligible to vote for the proposed ordinance granting a franchise to an applicant seeking to operate a cockpit, said Councilor Lyndon Acap. 
 
Of the 12 councilors present during the Sangguniang Panlungsod’s (SP) session on Tuesday, seven voted in favor of Rockwell and Lumber that plans to operate a cockpit in Barangay Esteban, Lapuz district. 
 
According to Acap, seven was the majority vote or more than half of 12. 
 
The chairman of the committee on games, amusements and professional sports said he will seek a “reconsideration.” 
 
“I went to Ma’am Ruth (Arroyo) – the SP secretary – kon may insakto nga pamaagi (on what is the proper procedure to do so),” said Acap whose committee endorsed Rockwell and Lumber’s franchise application. 
 
On Tuesday, Espinosa said the majority count was eight. He raised the number of those eligible to vote to 13 (12 councilors plus himself as presiding officer). 
 
He arrived at eight as majority number using the formula of “half plus one” then rounding it off. 
 
Nobody voted against granting Rockwell and Lumber a franchise. The five other councilors present merely opted to abstain. They were councilors Armand Parcon, Jason Gonzales, Ed Peñaredondo, R Leone Gerochi, and Lex Tupas. 
 
The seven councilors who voted in favor of Rockwell and Lumber were Acap, Rodel Fullon Agado, Joshua Alim, Jay Treñas, Reyland Hervias, Lady Julie Grace Baronda, and Liezel Zulueta-Salazar. 
 
“Nakakuha kami seven votes, which is more than half of 12,” said Acap. 
 
Espinosa could not be reached for comment as of this writing. 
 
Councilor Alim also had the same position as Acap’s. He said right after the voting on Tuesday that the SP presiding officer can only vote if there’s a tie in the voting. There was none on Tuesday. 
 
Last week, the SP granted Iloilo Sportsmen, Inc. a franchise to operate the Iloilo Coliseum as a cockpit arena. 
 
The coliseum is located in Barangay San Isidro, Jaro district and is the frequent venue of big-time cock derbies in Iloilo City, notably the Candelaria derby every district fiesta of Jaro. 
 
Acap believes that more cockpits can deliver huge financial revenues to Iloilo City. Two months ago he introduced a measure allowing the operation of cockpits in the city’s six districts – excluding the City Proper – but it failed to gather support from fellow councilors./ PN",c5ee235c-b826-4758-ad9e-deb5923fcc7c,News,2015-09-03T05:15:52Z,Panay News,Espinosa’s SP majority  formula questioned,0.0,News
2609,"KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 14 (Bernama) -- Hong Leong Investment Bank has  maintained its ""buy"" call with a target price of RM1.98 on AirAsia Bhd following its unit Asia Aviation Capital Ltd's (AACL) announcement it has entered into an aircraft lease transaction with Indonesia AirAsia X (IAAX). 
IAAX will lease five Airbus A320-200s aircraft for a period of 12 months and pay US$350,000 per month to AACL. 

IAAX will be paying a similar rate as the previous lessee, Indonesia AirAsia (IAA), and in total AACL will receive US$21 million from this leasing exercise. 

Prior to the agreement, these aircraft were being leased by IAA, which is currently experiencing excess capacity (IAA faces difficulties in domestic flights due to government regulation of the ceiling price and Batik Air's aggressive capacity addition) and will subsequently return these aircraft to AACL. 

""We expect these aircraft will be slotted into the Australian route to entrench IAAX's position and deter any potential competitor in this route,"" said the research house. 

Currently, IAAX flies from Denpasar to Melbourne, Taipei and Jakarta, it said. 

As at noon, AirAsia Bhd eased three sen to RM1.22, with 11,0000 shares changing hands.

She loves improving things, fixing things, changing things, decorating things - trash-to-treasure stuff, and we share that same excitement every time we find some new piece at a yard sale or the thrift shop. Both our homes reflect our eclectic collections with a citified vibe which is just a touch Bohemian, but with a splash of Country for good measure. Nothing Spartan about our homes. Come in, put your feet up, let the kids run around.
But whether my daughter's interests are from nurture --I've involved myself in almost every kind of art form throughout my life, from music, to interior design, to sculpture, painting, and fiction writing, which she grew up with -- or from nature, I guess we'll never know. Perhaps she's simply inherited the same crazy genes that I did. (How frustrating not to know who else in our history had the same wild ride through life.)
And now she's painting, something she'd never tried before.
Today I present these with great pride. I've never been an abstractist, much as I admire so much of it , but the spontaneity of this art form seems to be so natural to her. These are very large canvases. If you are going to make a bold, modern statement, make it big!

943,"DES MOINES, Iowa — He's behind in the polls and has spent little time in Iowa of late, but Chris Christie is set to get a major bump in the leadoff caucus state with endorsements from nearly all of the local Republican heavyweights who tried to recruit him to run four years ago. 
 
Six of the seven big-money donors and activists who flew to New Jersey to urge the Republican governor to run in the 2012 race plan to formally endorse Christie in Des Moines Tuesday. The news was first reported by The Des Moines Register. 
 
""What we've looked at and come around to is similar thoughts as in 2011,"" said Bruce Rastetter, a major GOP donor who made his fortune in the pork and ethanol industries. ""We need blunt, bold leadership. We need somebody that can actually govern."" 
 
Of the seven who hopped aboard the private plane to the East coast in 2011, two have long been vocal supporters and one has said he would not endorse because he works for an elected official. Getting the majority to publicly endorse Christie is a boon for his campaign. He has struggled to compete in a crowded field that includes attention-grabbing front-runner Donald Trump. 
 
""Whatever he needs, we're going to be behind him,"" said real estate developer Gary Kirke, who said the group wanted to stick together. 
 
His backers think his chances are improving after strong debate performances and with two governors — Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry —now out of the race. Now Rastetter said he hopes the endorsements will send a message to Iowa Republicans, that they should ""give him another look."" 
 
Christie held a town hall meeting with Rastetter Monday night, telling the crowd gathered in a cavernous barn that ""you'll always know how hard I'm willing to fight for you."" He declined to talk about the endorsements in advance of the Tuesday press conference. 
 
The trip this week marks his ninth to the leadoff caucus state this year. Christie, who has focused more heavily on New Hampshire, has spent less time here than many other contenders, though he put in a marathon day at the Iowa State Fair in August and has a well-regarded team, with respected operatives Phil Valenziano and Jeffrey Boeyink. 
 
Campaign aides said Christie will be ramping up his visits to the state in the fall. Mikel Derby, who works for the state's transportation department and who was part of the Christie recruitment effort in 2011, said there is still time for Christie to do well. 
 
""History is littered with the Bachmanns and Walkers who are superstars real early. There's no purpose in peaking in August and September,"" said Derby, who has been with Christie all along. 
 
Still, while these endorsements matter, most agree Christie will still have to invest more time in Iowa. Republican State Rep. Chip Baltimore, who has not endorsed a candidate, said there was no substitute for retail politicking. 
 
""If he is not here, he will not do well,"" Baltimore said. ""Gov. Christie, when he talks to people and meets people, is very persuasive. People walk away from that generally feeling positive toward him.""",ddca0d37-4d60-4641-9141-288aa10d25db,News,2015-09-29T04:05:15Z,Minneapolis Star Tribune,Iowans who sought to draft Christie in 2011 are with him for 2016,0.0,News

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Tony Romo threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to Jason Witten with 7 seconds left, and the Dallas Cowboys overcame three turnovers that led to easy New York points to beat the Giants 27-26 on Sunday night.

The Cowboys drove 72 yards in just 1:27 after forcing the Giants to settle for Josh Brown's fourth field goal when a touchdown would have sealed New York's first victory in an opener against Dallas. The Cowboys are 8-0 against New York in openers.

Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie returned a fumble 57 yards for a touchdown, and the Giants had to go just 1 yard for their other TD after Trumaine McBride's interception.

Adrian Hanauer doesn’t just have an eye for talent in soccer. Seattle Sounders owner Adrian Hanauer’s interests come together in the club’s Posters by the People program. Through Posters by the People, Hanauer’s able to take an idea of the Galaxy’s and make it better, as well as mixing two passions in art and sport.

In his first season as Sounders FC Director of Community Outreach, Levesque is organizing Seattle’s 30 in 30 campaign.

The Reign continued their exceptional season with a hard-fought 2-1 win over the Washington Spirit, a preview of the #1 v #4 playoff matchup to come (Sunday 6:30pm at Memorial Stadium,) the exact same first round matchup as last year.  Notable in the game was some drama from the sideline , as Seattle owner Bill Predmore was at the Reign bench despite it being explicitly against the NWSL rules for him to be there, refusing to leave when asked to do so and reportedly throwing an organizing volunteer’s phone as a part of the scene. 
 MLS  
In case you somehow missed it, Drogba’s here and debuted in dramatic fashion, simultaneously ending Chicago’s season while keeping Montreal’s alive , scoring a hat trick on his debut, including the equalizer and game-winner within 5 minutes. A particularly bitter end for Chicago, who after missing out on Jermaine Jones last year now will likely watch another transfer target help another Conference rival into the playoffs. Fire fans can only hope that the reported 300k in TAM/GAM they received from the Impact will be invested into quality defenders (not JKH or Ianni) soon, as their attack seems to be rounding into MLS 3.0 form with Mike Magee, David Accam, Harry Shipp, Patrick Nyarko, Gilberto, and Kennedy Igboananike. 
 
Kevin Ellis has quite a unique background story , featuring an unknown father, a twin brother’s sacrifice, overcoming his mother’s death, leaving college to pursue pro soccer, and an overwhelming love of the game.

Also an interesting examination of supporters’ chants and their use of profanity on broadcasts. 
 
Univision’s version of SportsCenter, Contacto Deportivo, surpassed ESPN’s flagship program in viewership in July and August by 42% (that’s a lot), winning specifically in the key Adults 18-49 demographic, regardless of language.

In its third incarnation this millennium, US women’s professional soccer looks like it will reach Year Four for the first time.

Rosell would be a solid player returning to MLS, though he would have to go through allocation due to the transfer fee SKC received; LA currently sits atop the allocation order.

5809,"Solar Station Lander is a complete power generation system, which does not require a rooftop.  What is more- you can also build it yourself.
Generating your own solar power at home has never been easier and more affordable than it is at the moment. Technology is improving, governments are giving incentives, and when we add the “feel great” feeling to all that, we get the perfect explanation to why so many people around are already having their solar power generating systems at home.
The most popular home solar power systems are those mounted on house rooftops, although they are only within the reach of house owners, whose roofs are strong enough to hold the panels.
However, the increasing interest in alternative solar power systems have led to the development of quite a number of interesting non-rooftop solar technologies (especially those that you can build yourself) that are giving rooftop solar a good run for its money.
One such system is the Solar Station, a stand-alone solar unit that comes with its own energy storage. In terms of specifications, it has a 600W solar generator, 2000 W inverter and a pack of six batteries, 84 AH each. The unit is a 4′ x 6′ (1.2 x 1.8 meter) shed, which can also be used for storage of things other than energy.
The system is currently available only through the Indiegogo campaign for the modest price of $6800. But, the makers have something else to offer, which is both great news for DIY lovers, and those who cannot spare the bulk sum all at ones. For just $25, all backers receive a detailed digital DIY construction plan, which comes with photos, list of all parts, and extra tips. Schools and nonprofit organizations receive a $5 discount. Additionally, paying $45 will get you a downloadable video of a Solar Station building workshop, while for $500 you can attend a workshop, learn how to do it all, and have a beer and dinner with the makers.
The guys behind the Solar Station hope to raise enough money through their campaign in order to begin delivery across the US in October this year. Check out what they have to offer and give them a boost- but hurry, there are only two weeks left to go.

2078,"AUSTRALIA will have a new-look line-up when it attempts to wrap up the ODI series against England at Old Trafford tonight. 
 
But the old tensions between the teams will be the same after debate raged on about the dismissal of England all-rounder Ben Stokes for obstructing the field in the second game at Lord's. 
 
Stokes was given out after Mitchell Starc's attempted run-out hit the palm of his glove, England captain Eoin Morgan arguing his batting partner had acted instinctively to save himself from injury. 
 
But former Australian one-day captain George Bailey added fuel to the fire by questioning Morgan's insistence that he would have withdrawn the appeal. 
 
Bailey, who led Australia in 28 Twenty20 internationals and 29 ODIs before losing his place in the team ahead of this year's World Cup, also poked fun at Morgan for taking the moral high ground, questioning whether he would be so sporting over other contentious dismissals. 
 
""It's a big call for Eoin to say that,"" Bailey said. ""I assume, if that's how he feels, then any time a batter nicks one onto his pad and gets given out lbw, or gets wrongfully given out caught behind, he'll call them back as well."" 
 
Bailey also backed new Australian captain Steve Smith and Starc over their stance. 
 
""I think the correct decision was made,"" Bailey said. ""I don't think the ball was going to hit him (Stokes). I think the ball was going to hit the stumps and he was out of his crease. I don't think there was any need for him to put his hand up to defend himself."" 
 
While Australia went on to win the game by 64 runs, it lost three players to injury for the rest of the series. 
 
All-rounder Shane Watson injured his calf, opener David Warner broke his thumb and seamer Nathan Coulter-Nile strained his hamstring. 
 
Not only did Watson's injury end his series, he also took the opportunity to call time on his Test career. 
 
The 34-year-old played 59 Tests, finishing with four centuries, 24 half-centuries and 3731 runs, as well as 75 wickets at an average of 33. 
 
A two-time Allan Border medal winner and 2011 Test player of the year, Watson said he knew it was time to move on. 
 
""I don't have that real fight in me, especially for Test cricket, knowing the lengths physically that I'd have to go through, mentally and technically as well, to be at my best,"" he said. 
 
His place in the one-day squad has been taken by Victorian all-rounder John Hastings, while Aaron Finch and Peter Handscomb were called in to replace Warner and Coulter-Nile.

368,"BOTHELL, Wash., Sept. 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Leviton Network Solutions announced today that its OM4+ Violet Fiber Cabling System, installed in eBay data centers, was recognized among the best in the industry by the judges of the Cabling Installation & Maintenance 2015 Innovators Awards program. The judging panel consisted of cabling and communications system specifiers, designers, integrators and managers with vast professional experience. Leviton Network Solutions and eBay was recognized as a Gold honoree. 

""On behalf of the Cabling Installation & Maintenance Innovator Awards, I would like to congratulate Leviton Network Solutions and eBay on their Gold–level honoree status,"" said Cabling Installation & Maintenance Group Publisher Alan Bergstein. ""This competitive, unbiased program celebrates the most innovative projects in the structured cabling industry. We are pleased to celebrate Leviton Network Solutions and eBay's Gold status and recognize their contribution to the structured cabling industry.""

Sponsored by: As part of its data center technology roadmap, eBay planned to upgrade to 40GbE to its servers. In order to meet the requirements of the new design, it needed a cabling solution that would support extremely long multimode fiber runs — up to 500 meters in length — and allow migration to future bandwidth speeds of 100GbE and 400GbE. 

The company tested the Leviton OM4+ Premium Violet Data Center fiber system with extended reach 40GBASE-XSR4 transceivers. While these transceivers have a manufacturer's stated maximum distance of 400 meters, the channel tested successfully beyond that length, with zero errors or dropped packets when transmitting over 500 meters. The testing subsequently led eBay to install the OM4+ system in four of its data centers. The system uses all OM4+ cabling and connectivity, including Leviton Opt-X Unity trunks, harnesses, array cords, and cassettes.

215,"A wave of relief swept over me when, at my first appointment to a new rheumatologist, she said she had a name for the elusive condition that threatened my life and sickened me for more than a decade and a half. I now knew, for certain, that I was right; all of my symptoms were tied to just one disease. However, my joy was short-lived. Seconds later, I was told that the autoimmune disease battering my body, igG4 related systemic disease, had no cure.  As a single woman, I wondered, who would care for me if I could not. 
 
At that time, I lived alone in a townhouse, in a city where I knew no one other than my next door neighbor.  My home had stairs, slot of them, which often, pain would not allow me to climb. I worked full-time to maintain health insurance and prescription coverage. My job also allowed me to try meeting the debilitating obligations of my never-ending medical bills because there was no one else providing me with financial support. 
 
My rheumatologist ordered blood tests, CT scans, x-rays and MRI’s to confirm her diagnosis and then came a new round of drugs, aimed at controlling the inflammation that damaged organs in my body.  The “what ifs” flooded in and gave me a headache over the next few months as.  What if I can’t work anymore? How will I survive? Will I have to sell my home?  How will I pay for in house care or a nursing home?  If I can stay in my townhome, is it safe? What if I fall ill in the house alone? Who will be able to get in to get me help? 
 
I thought I was prepared for anything when I bought more life insurance and had my will, healthy proxy, living will and power of attorney updated.  But, that only took care of my financial matters, my funeral and medical wishes but not my everyday needs. I’d neglected to buy long term disability insurance when I was well. By the time I finally applied my pre-existing condition prevented from getting it. 
 
I thought about rebuilding my savings so I could pay for private care on my own if I couldn’t work. However, trying to avoid being sued over doctor’s bills or being forced to file for bankruptcy made it impossible for me to accumulate any real wealth. 
 
I knew I didn’t want my parents to shoulder all the burden of caring for me nor did I want to move into their house.  So, I was motivated to get creative to solve the question: Who will care for me? I jotted down a list of relatives and close friends who I could call upon, in a rotation, to avoid stressing any one person out or abusing their generosity.  I looked for services that I could afford that could help me maintain my independence: carpet cleaners, maid services, grocery stores that let you shop from home and have your groceries delivered, and handyman services. I put handheld shower heads in all the bathrooms so I could sit down and wash myself. I also got a car that had seats that folded down for the times I could walk on my own and required a walker or wheelchair. I switched most of my bills from paper to electronic so they could be paid online. 
 
By far, the hardest thing I had to learn to do was ask for help and learn to take it when it’s offered. I had to change my attitude by not seeing myself as helpless just because I need some help; that made a world of difference. I began letting other people know when my doctor’s appointments and procedures were scheduled so they knew when I might need to be picked up or require assistance. Before I knew it is assemble an army, that’s ready, willing and able to care for me at those times I can’t care for myself.

2821,"Turmeric is one of those spices you know at first taste. Complete with a golden hue, this peppery and earthy flavour makes its mark in many traditional South Asian and Middle Eastern meals. And while many people love to spice it up with turmeric, they may also want to incorporate it for its incredible health benefits as well. Curcumin is the compound in the spice that not only gives it its vivid colour, but also provides it with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumor, antibacterial and antiviral properties, as noted from research in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition.
Here are four conditions you can improve by incorporating turmeric into your diet. 1. Acne Since turmeric has anti-inflammatory properties, it only makes sense that it would help alleviate zits, which are simply inflamed pores. Tasneem Bhatia, MD, author of What Doctors Eat, says that one way to treat bad skin with this spice is by blending turmeric with water or yogurt into a paste. 2. Pain Before you pop another pill, try using turmeric, which is a much safer option for alleviating your pain. According to Isaac Eliaz, MD, founder of the Amitabha Clinic & Healing Center, this spice supports circulation, immunity and tissue repair. 3. Diabetes While you may assume it’s simply steering clear of too much sugar that will help you to avoid diabetes, a study from Diabetes Care found that for people who were diagnosed with prediabetes, taking daily curcumin capsules for nine months protected them from developing full-blown type 2 diabetes. 4 . Bloating Eliaz says that gut inflammation can be a cause of bloating, which makes turmeric come at the top of the list for natural ways to relieve this condition. And in addition, this spice can keep your digestion on track and avoid gut issues by promoting circulation and detoxification. Do you incorporate turmeric into your diet regularly?

3861,"REDDITCH rail users travelling into Birmingham for the Rugby World Cup last weekend were left reeling after an ""appalling service"" at Redditch railway station. 
 
People travelling into the second city faced huge queues at Redditch station on both Saturday and Sunday mornings - with some people missing trains. 
 
To make matters worse the ticket office was not open, and just one of the ticket machines was working. 
 
Tens of thousands of fans descended on Birmingham over the weekend for two rugby world cup games being held at Villa Park, as well as other attractions. 
 
On the Saturday the venue hosted south Africa v Samoa, while on Sunday it was Australia v Uruguay. 
 
One disgruntled rail user, Colin Bates, said that despite extensive coverage in the media about how busy Birmingham was going to be London Midland seem unable to plan for extra passengers. 
 
Mr Bates, who was travelling to Villa Park on Sunday, said: ""I managed to be the last paying person to get on from Redditch. I would say 90 per cent of the queue behind just left when the train came in and got on, taking the risk of being fined by London Midland. 
 
""The train was very overcrowded, there was no ticket inspector or anyone trying to sell tickets, so the majority of people didn't pay. We stopped for ages at every station as there were so many people on the train and got to Aston station 20 minutes late, also with no tickets being checked."" 
   Promoted stories   
As well as the rugby it was the first weekend following the opening of Birmingham's Grand Central, which said 150,000 eager shoppers passed through its doors, and an arts festival. 
 
Mr Bates added: ""Surely London Midland can put on staff or advise if tickets can be bought on the train. 
 
""It is an appalling service that they should be ashamed of. Redditch passengers deserve a train service that can cope with people trying to actually use the service.""

5300,"Batteriser is a crowdfunding campaign for a magical little sleeve you pop over your AA batteries, extending their useful life by ‘up to 800%’. Sound a little too good to be true? That’s because it 800% is*. The science behind the Batteriser isn’t actually pure crap. The premise is this: a new AA battery starts life producing a voltage of 1.5V. That voltage decreases over time, until the battery eventually has no more juice in it. But below a certain cut-off threshold, different for every device, the battery is no longer able to produce enough voltage, even if there’s plenty of energy left in a cell. Confused? Put it this way: an Apple Wireless Keyboard requires 1.075V or more from its batteries to function. So if the batteries inside drop below that level — and they will — the keyboard will tell you to replace them. But there’s still juice left in the batteries — pop them in an old-school flashlight, and you’ll get a dim but very real light coming out of the bulb. Advertisement This is the problem the Batteriser sleeve seeks to solve: using a miniature DC - DC converter, it provides a constant 1.5V from the AA battery for its entire life, before it finally drops dead when there’s actually no more juice to give. So Does It Actually Work? And Batteriser actually works! As far as we can tell without any conclusive testing, Batteriser does make a battery produce a constant 1.5V output, using the majority of the energy in the cell (minus some inefficiencies in power conversion). But the problem comes in the form of the company’s marketing, which uses a perfect combination of techno double-speak and ‘creative’ statistics to make you think you need its $20 gadgets. Batteriser has two main claims: that a ‘significant number’ (this used to say ‘all’, before it was quietly changed) of batteries you throw away have only used 20% of their capacity; and that by throwing on a Batteriser sleeve, you can improve the battery life of your devices by up to 800%. Let’s ignore the obvious math flaw here (if you can regain that ‘missing’ 80% of capacity, that’s a 500% increase, not 800%) and focus on that first claim. Dr Bob Roohparvar, the CEO of parent company Batteroo, told me that number comes from this 2003 study from ETH Zurich. The study collected batteries from recycling points around Switzerland, and tested them for remaining capacity. It’s a solid methodology, but Roohparvar twists the results. He displays a table for ‘accumulated average’ rather than a straight percentage, which makes it seem like far more batteries have a higher capacity remaining. You can see the difference pretty well in this graph from the original study: the upper grey line is the accumulated average, quoted by Roohparvar; the lower line shows the actual distribution. More important than Roohparvar’s twisting the stats, though, is the difference in device you use the Batteriser with. For some particular high-power devices (really, the only example are old-skool cameras that run on AAs), the cut-off voltage will be as high as 1.4V (remember, those batteries only start at 1.5V). In those rare devices, Batteriser will make a difference — who knows, maybe even the 800% difference claimed! But in most things you use batteries in, like remote controls or keyboards, the cut-off voltage is much lower, and therefore any potential Batteriser savings are much lower. What Other People Say A handful of electrical engineers extensively debunked Batteriser’s claims when the product was first announced — the most thorough is probably this 40-minute YouTube video from Dave Jones, which takes apart the science and claims behind the Batteriser. He attacked their claims further in a blog post, as did others. One of Batteroo’s only solid bits of evidence to back up its claims is a test, conducted by an independent lab (but designed by Batteroo). It compared a Garmin GPS’s run time with and without Batteriser. The GPS has a cut-off voltage of 1.1V, meaning that according to Batteriser’s haters, there should only be a modest increase in runtime (if at all). On the face of it, the results are good for Batteroo: without Batteriser, runtime is 1 hour 43 minutes; with it, it’s 10 hours 12 minutes. That sounds like a huge improvement, but really it’s because of a tiny condition in the testing parameters: the test ended when the GPS died, or when a low-battery message is displayed. TechnologyCatalyst replicated the experiment on video, and (surprise!) found the test to be bullshit: with regular AAs, you get a low-battery message at an hour or two in, saying that the backlight can’t be turned on. But tap that message away, and the GPS will keep working just fine — in the video above, it ran just fine on normal AA batteries, for 17 hours. The wave of bad publicity led to a few changes: Batteriser changed its website and video, to remove the claim that ‘all’ batteries have 80% capacity remaining (a mistake Roohparvar told me was because of a “miscommunication” between the engineers and the “website guys”); and Roohparvar accusing detractors like Jones of being paid by ‘big battery’ to take down his disruptive product. When I outright asked Roohparvar about his company’s claims, and all the accusations against it, I got the same kind of run-around: a five-minute explanation about peak voltages, followed by an incredibly bizarre parable about a snail and a well, stolen from his brother’s video: It’s all a shame, because if Batteriser was honest about its product — a tiny little device that stabilises voltage over the life of a battery — it would still sell. But instead, it’s using bad math and sketchy marketing to dupe people into thinking it’s some kind of magic battery-saving panacea.",569aceec-6340-4972-b083-499e636f7b1e,Blog,2015-09-23T03:30:00Z,io9,Don't Buy The Bullshit This Indiegogo Campaign Is Selling,1.0,Blog

3624,"Patients will benefit from ""world-class care"" closer to home under new plans from the head of the NHS. 
 
NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens wants to protect the future of small regional hospitals and bring expertise in areas such as eye care and cancer to patients' doorsteps. 
 
In a speech to the  Confederation of British Industry (CBI) in London, Mr Stevens will set out how partnerships between leading NHS hospitals and smaller ones will drive up the quality of services. 
 
The new links involve some of the best hospitals in the country, including the Royal Marsden cancer hospital in London, the Christie cancer hospital in Manchester and Moorfields Eye Hospital in London. 
 
Hospitals that are excellent performers will form groups to raise standards, and will set up clinics and other services in local district general hospitals. 
 
For example, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust already runs 22 ""mini-centres"" in and around London alongside its main site. 
 
It will now produce a toolkit so other specialties - such as cancer - can replicate its model. 
 
Mr Stevens said: ""Rather than patients routinely having to travel to specialist centres, we want to test the idea of bringing that expertise to their local hospital. 
 
""So key departments in smaller local hospitals are in some cases now going to be run by some of the best hospitals in Britain, such as Moorfields, the Royal Marsden or the Christie.

2992,"Sponsored. A group, Anambra State G177, has accused the governor of Anambra State of favoritism and trying to allocated all Nigeria police recruitment slot for the state to his native town.
The governor, who is from Aguleri town in Anambra State have been accused of favoring his town in appointments and allocation of the state's resources.

In a release sent to newsmen, signed by its Coordinator, Ikechukwu Emeka Onyia and Secretary, Chidi Arinze,the group called on members of the state house of assembly to ensure that the  injustice is address or they will face massive recall from the electorates.

The press release reads;
We uncovered plot by the governor of Anambra State, Willie Obiano to allocate 270 slots given to the state by Nigeria Police to natives of his home town, Aguleri as he did in Nigeria Army recruitment and other appointments in the State.

After consultation across Anambra towns on this issue, we resolve as follows :

That we are taking it to our representatives in the State House of Assembly .

That members of State House of Assembly are the people's elected representatives and they are mandated to represent our people in the affairs of our state .

That Anambra State is made up of 177 towns with 30 members of Assembly representing them and since we are allotted 270 police recruitment slots , every town in Anambra must get one slot at least !

We also set up machineries across towns to follow this process in order to drive fairness and result .

We also agreed that an Honourable member that is representing any of the towns denied a slot in this upcoming recruitment will face well coordinated recall from the House of Assembly by the people .

Any town denied a slot, will be termed mark of poor representative on the part of whoever that is representing such town in the House of Assembly .

And we shall push for the first ever successful recall in Nigeria.

Also resolved to see to a fair Anambra State where all the town will feel the impact of the government.

We agreed that people are the engine room of democracy and that they have role especially as it concerns raising issues on public policies and suggesting alternative policies for the better Anambra State.

We therefore call on 30 members of Anambra House of Assembly not to take Anambra People's silent as a sign of weakness. Correct this ongoing imbalance through parliamentary intervention or face mass recall, the press statement concluded.",4ec124b4-4a7d-4005-8d9f-d672ac6574a0,Blog,2015-09-04T21:35:05Z,Ouchfrandib Post........!

3555,"Memo to the Brampton person who won Friday's $60 million Lotto Max draw: scrounge up another $18 million — which would now seem like pocket change to you, I'm sure — and you could be the proud owner of the most expensive piece of property up for sale in Hamilton. 
 

                            The 69-hectare (171-acre) parcel, on Garner Road East between Highway 6 and Fiddlers Green Road in Ancaster, is on the market for $78 million. 
 

                            And while the value of the land is connected to its potential for commercial and industrial development, you won't have to pitch a tent because there is a house on the property. 
 

                            Not too shabby of a house either. 
 

                            Built in 1995 by developer Frank Silvestri as his family home, the mansion was reported to be 31,000 square feet at the time of its construction, with 11 bathrooms, a 14-car garage and a master bedroom that measured 1,500 square feet on its own. 
 

                            Silvestri told The Spectator back then that it might have been the largest single family home in the country. 
 

                            The land is situated about four kilometres northwest of the John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport and is owned by a company associated with the Silvestri family. 
 

                            A large chunk of the parcel is zoned under the city's Airport Prestige Business category, which permits a variety of uses, including hotels, conference centres, office space and research and development facilities. 
 

                            But take note, if you're considering making an offer — no explosives manufacturing, no pulp and paper mills, no rendering, slaughtering or eviscerating of animals and no vulcanizing of rubber will be permitted. 
 

                            Listing agent Conrad Zurini, of Re/Max Escarpment Realty, said the property went up for sale at the beginning of summer and there have been some expressions of interest. 
 

                            ""There is a lot of desire to own land in this city from out-of-town,"" he said. ""It's a choice piece of land. 
 

                            ""Properties like this could take years to sell,"" Zurini added. ""You need that right person and the right maturity. It takes time."" 
 

                            At its current asking price, the land is valued at $1.13 million per hectare, or about $456,000 an acre. 
 

                            ""If it was residential land, it would be even higher,"" said Zurini, noting that he's seen some vacant residential land in Hamilton sell for more than $800,000 an acre. 
 

                            The second-most expensive property for sale in Hamilton appears to be 555 Glancaster Rd. in Glanbrook, site of the former Glancaster Golf and Country Club, which ceased operations at the end of May. 
 

                            The 51-hectare (127-acre) property is listed for sale at $29,845,000, which works out to $581,000 per hectare or about $235,000 per acre.

Apple’s latest and greatest operating system for Macs — OS X El Capitan — is now available for free to users around the globe.
OS X El Capitan brings with it a number of new features like Split View and Spotlight search, along with tons of under-the-hood performance improvements that aim to make the Mac more rock-solid than ever. Best of all, it’s absolutely free for all Mac owners.
Apple revealed the operating system this summer at its Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco, showing off the faster and more-repsonsive design to developers. Beta testing has been incredibly postive, according to Apple’s VP of software engineering, Craig Federighi.
“People love using their Macs, and one of the biggest reasons is the power and ease-of-use of OS X,” said Federighi in a statement yesterday. “El Capitan refines the Mac experience and improves performance in a lot of little ways that make a very big difference. Feedback from our OS X beta program has been incredibly positive and we think customers are going to love their Macs even more with El Capitan.”
El Capitan’s new features include an improved Mission Control, better Notes app, Safari tweaks, Maps with public transit directions, natural search for Spotlight, and the addition of Metal for Mac, bringing a big boost in performance for games.
Mac users can pick up the update from the Mac App Store, or via the Software Update section of the Apple menu.

Govt unsure aboutwhy Aussie team held back: PM 


 NEW YORK, Sept 30 (BSS): Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said her government was still not sure why the Australian cricket team postponed their scheduled tour to Bangladesh. 

""We are not sure why the Australian Cricket team is not coming to Bangladesh,"" she told a press conference at Bangladesh UN Permanent Mission here on Tuesday evening. 

The Prime Minister, however, said both sides were discussing the matter. 

 ""In the past we have witnessed similar situation. Pakistan and India teams played in Bangladesh. Even the World Cup cricket was hosted here. It's absolutely a matter of Australia why they suddenly decided not to visit Bangladesh,"" she said. 

Sheikh Hasina noted that Bangladesh hosted a number of sports events in the past with foolproof security and no untoward incidents happened. 

 ""Untoward incidents have taken place in many countries, but not in Bangladesh ... our law enforcement agencies and all concerned have enough expertise to ensure security of the players and our people are also very much conscious about this,"" she said.",4f10aeee-68a7-468b-965b-97db55c00bc5,News,2015-09-30T17:22:45Z,Financial Express Bangladesh,"Govt unsure about

110,"NEW YORK — Time and time again Serena Williams escaped during this Grand Slam season on her quest to sweep all four majors. But finally, on Friday, she hit a roadblock that caused her not just to trip, but to fall.

That hurdle came in the most unlikely of forms in Roberta Vinci, a 32-year-old world No. 43 who was making her debut appearance in a Grand Slam semifinal.

It also came in the form of unthinkable pressure loaded onto the shoulders of the 33-year-old world No. 1, who was trying to sweep all four majors in a calendar year for the first time since 1988, when Steffi Graf did so.

""I don't think we can understand the scale of what she felt,"" said Leif Shiras, a TV commentator for British broadcaster Sky Sports and former player in an interview. ""It's tough to play against history. You have to feel like her loss is a symptom of that pressure.""

Williams swatted away any suggestion that her Friday demise — after 26 Grand Slam match wins this year and 33 dating to Wimbledon last season — was due to expectation of the moment.

""I told you guys I don't feel pressure,"" a tired Williams told reporters in a news conference. ""I never felt pressure. … I never felt that pressure to win here. I said that from the beginning.""

From the beginning of 2015, however, Williams' drive for the Grand Slam has been a fragile, bumpy one. At the French Open she worked through five three-setters, the most of any major in her career; at Wimbledon she trailed Heather Watson by two breaks in the third set in the third round; a week ago Bethanie Mattek-Sands had her on the ropes in a night match.

Each time, a Serena 'W;' but not today.

""Today was not a good day,"" her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, told a small group of reporters, saying Williams woke up feeling off.

""Players are humans,"" he continued. ""How many times did it happen this year where she felt like this and she still found her way through? She didn't find her way today.""

Even Vinci, undone by Williams four times (all in straight sets) coming in, could see the most feared opponent in tennis looking tentative, double faulting, yelling at herself to find a way.

""(In) my mind, I say, 'Think about this, she's nervous,'"" a smiling Vinci said. ""So I tried to keep fighting for every single point.""

""It was apparent to all of us who have watched her for 20 years that she was nervous today,"" Chris Evert said plainly on ESPN.

It was a different kind of match than most of her three-setters at the majors, however. Seven times she had come back from dropping the first set. But only once in a three-set match did she drop the second – as she did Friday – and then right herself.

In the third set against Vinci, Williams appeared lost and at times confounded, however. She barked at herself at one moment, all of Arthur Ashe yelling shouts of encouragement. The next, she was quieting herself — palm towards the ground — trying to stay calm.

""I was just trying to win points at that point and win the match,"" she explained.

One shouldn't underestimate the emotional impact of the Slam, Shiras said.

""The toll of this journey she was on was too much for her today,"" Shiras said. ""She was trying to dig deep and the way to generate energy for her is to get that passion out. But I think that can tire her; there is an element of fatigue that plays into this story. She was at a breaking point; she was boiling. And Vinci was drawing that out of her. It was amazing drama.""

The pressure finally got to Serena Williams and killed her Grand Slam dream

Drama with a twist: On this day, the 21-time major champion, chasing history in front of a home crowd, with more power on her racket than anyone in the game was on the losing end. A defeat with a capital 'D.'

""Every loss is difficult,"" Mouratoglou said. ""I think she lost her way mentally. Tactically she didn't know what to do. When you make the wrong choices, you lose the points you're supposed to win and then you make more and more wrong choices. She lost her way on the path tactically.""

A road that started in Melbourne ends in New York — and not in the way Williams imagined.

4479,"TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback has sent a message criticizing government dependence and touting his welfare reforms to his supporters. 
 
The email was sent Wednesday night by governor’s office spokeswoman, Melika Willoughby. The Wichita Eagle ) reports that Brownback’s office regularly has sent out emails lauding his policies since he was re-elected. 
 
In the email, the Republican governor accuses Democrats of trying to “increase the number of Americans who are dependent on the government.” A bill Brownback signed in April that solidified a work requirement for able-bodied welfare recipients without dependents also was praised in the email.

3766,"Events of the weekend brought to mind this passage from Acts 5*:

33 When they [the members of the Sanhedrin] heard this, they were furious and wanted to put them to death. 34 But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, who was honored by all the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin and ordered that the men be put outside for a little while. 35 Then he addressed the Sanhedrin: “Men of Israel, consider carefully what you intend to do to these men. 36 Some time ago Theudas appeared, claiming to be somebody, and about four hundred men rallied to him. He was killed, all his followers were dispersed, and it all came to nothing. 37 After him, Judas the Galilean appeared in the days of the census and led a band of people in revolt. He too was killed, and all his followers were scattered. 38 Therefore, in the present case I advise you: Leave these men alone! Let them go! For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail. 39 But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only find yourselves fighting against God.”

40 His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.

41 The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name. 42 Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Messiah.

When someone who is ""religious"" tells you that speaking the truth is wrong and that preaching the Word of God is wrong, then that tells me I am totally on the right track.  Satan used someone this weekend to try to undermine the message of love that fills the entire Bible; that came to completeness in the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ; and that, paired with ""don't judge others, 'cause your life is just as messy,"" exemplifies how we Christians should live.  It's small in the realm of persecutions, but it lets me know I'm on the right track, that Satan doesn't like that message.  So I'm gonna just rock on with preaching this word of God's love and acceptance for all people; it's beautifully inclusive.

""I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be for all people..."" (Luke 2:10)

""For God so loved the world that He gave his one and only Son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life"" (John 3:16).

527,"A poker player attacked and murdered the close friend of his former girlfriend's suspected lover, a court has heard. A poker player attacked and murdered the close friend of his former girlfriend's suspected lover, a court has heard. Crown prosecutor Tom Gyorffy, QC, told a Supreme Court jury on Wednesday that Collin Thomas became angry when George Anagnostellis refused to tell him where he could find his love rival.

Mr Gyorffy said Mr Thomas attacked Mr Anagnostellis, who was separated from his wife and living at his parents' home in Malvern East, before setting fire to the garage on April 11, 2014.

Mr Thomas has pleaded not guilty to one count of murder and one count of arson.

Mr Gyorffy said that at the time of his death, Mr Anagnostellis was an avid poker player who played and organised poker tournaments at local hotels.

The prosecutor described Mr Anagnostellis as a gentle man who was never violent or threatening to anyone.

Mr Gyorffy said Mr Thomas and his girlfriend, Tina Thwaites, who were both poker players, had been in a relationship for about a year when Ms Thwaites ended it some time before the alleged murder.

""Mr Thomas believed that she'd been having an affair with another poker player, Mr Billy Theoharis, and he was angry about that,"" the prosecutor told the jury.

""He was trying to track him (Mr Theoharis) down and was texting and calling his phone.

""Mr Theoharis was a good friend of the deceased man (Mr Anagnostellis).""

After playing poker at the Sandown Hotel, Mr Anagnostellis invited Mr Thomas, Andrew Heke and Scott Sullivan back to his parents' Malvern East home just after 1am on April 11.

The men went into the garage and sat around a table playing cards and drinking home-made ouzo and wine.

By 4.30am, Mr Sullivan became unwell and left the garage in a severely intoxicated state and was later picked up by his partner. Mr Heke was asleep at the table when Mr Sullivan left.

Mr Thomas then allegedly confronted Mr Anagnostellis about where he could find Mr Theoharis.

Mr Thomas later told police he assaulted Mr Anagnostellis about 20 to 30 times involving ""a mixture of punches, elbows, kicks, knees, head butts"" to the face, head and body.

""It's a bit of a blur,"" Mr Thomas told police.

""I'm not really too sure about how that went down. All I remember is getting to the point where I obviously felt angry enough to assault him.

""I was just not getting anywhere and just getting sandbagged and basically being treated like an idiot, like I didn't know anything. I wasn't getting the information, obviously, that I was after and I was getting frustrated.""

Mr Thomas wanted to find Mr Theoharis because there were accusations he had ""slept with my girlfriend (Ms Thwaites) at the time"" in late 2013.

Mr Gyorffy said Mr Anagnostellis suffered a number of serious head and neck injuries from the beating which led to his death.

""The Crown says Mr Thomas then poured petrol on the floor and over Mr Anagnostellis' body and set it alight before he left the scene.""

Defence barrister Colin Mandy told the jury Mr Thomas did not deny assaulting Mr Thomas but claimed the last time he saw him he was alive and about to set fire to himself and the garage.

""He (Mr Thomas) told the police that he dragged Andrew Heke out of there and was blown out of the door by the explosion that happened,"" Mr Mandy said.

The trial, before Justice Jack Forrest, continues. The story first appeared on The Age.",f18bbd65-57a4-414a-b78b-356b9ecb65f0,News,2015-09-30T05:46:21Z,Bendigo Advertiser,"Poker player killed love rival's friend, court hears",0.0,News

158,"Many organizations are seeking to expand their operations overseas as part of their growth strategies. In Bahrain, as well as around the world, globalization has entered a new phase, posing greater challenges for anti-bribery and corruption (ABC) compliance than ever before. Two factors are creating new issues for companies, according to a recent report by KPMG International.

First, a growing number of governments around the world are tightening ABC regulations or introducing new ones as we see in Bahrain. In the light of Kingdom’s expanding corporate culture, the government has introduced Law Number 01/2013 to expand the Amiri Decree Number 15/1976, in order to address bribery and corruption across both the public and private sectors. Second, as companies globalize their operations, they rely more heavily on third parties than before to do business in far-flung parts of the world, often in areas where there is a high risk of corruption. said: “the government has worked hard to enforce strict laws on bribery and corruption. However, as the global report highlights, with GCC based organizations and businesses increasingly investing overseas, reliance on and managing risk with third parties can be a challenge and adequate controls and monitoring must be put in place.” 

The survey, conducted by KPMG International with respondents from around the world, shows that companies are rising to the challenge but that a great deal more needs to be done to create a sturdy ABC compliance structure. For full details, read the report . The main findings of the survey include:

“Despite greater efforts to build ABC frameworks, it’s clear that there are gaping holes in them,” says Petrus Marais, Global Leader of Forensic Services for KPMG. “The problem is particularly acute in the management of third parties who increasingly act as conduits for bribes, making it harder to track. Respondents to the survey admit it’s the biggest challenge in the field of ABC, but they are not doing enough to develop a culture of compliance both among their employees and their vendors and other business associates.” 

About the survey

The survey targeted 659 respondents covering 64 countries, with 140 respondents based in Central & Eastern Europe (including Russia), 113 in Western European countries (excluding the UK), 105 from the Asia – Pacific region, 66 respondents in the U.S., 64 from the South American continent (31 in Mexico), 61 in South Africa and 41 in the UK.

Andrew Ashman, 49, was less than a week into the year-long Clipper Round the World Yacht Race when he was struck unconscious while sailing off the coat of Portugal. 
 
Veteran sailor and Clipper race founder Sir Robin Knox-Johnston paid tribute to Mr Ashman, who worked for many years as a London Ambulance paramedic. 
 
Sir Robin, the first person to sail non-stop single-handedly around the world, said: ""This is extremely sad news and my heart goes out to his bereaved family and friends, and to his fellow crew who have come to know Andrew with great affection during his training and the early days of this race. 
 
""Safety is always our utmost priority, as our record shows, and we shall investigate the incident immediately in full co-operation with the authorities."" 
 
Mr Ashman, an ""experienced yachtsman"" from Orpington, Kent, was adjusting the sail of his team's boat just after midnight last night when he was knocked unconscious by the sail and possibly the boom, race organisers said. 
 
He was given immediate medical assistance and attempts were made to resuscitate him, but he never regained consciousness and died in the early hours of this morning. 
   Promoted stories   
The vessel was in moderate seas when it was hit by a Force Six strong breeze (24-30 mph / 21-27 knots) and the tragedy happened. 
 
A spokesman for race organisers Clipper Ventures said: ""At this stage it looks like a tragic accident as far as we can see, but obviously there will be a full assessment. 
 
""The skipper and crew have been very upset."" 
 
His boat, sponsored by South African firm IchorCoal, had been sailing around 120 nautical miles off the Portuguese coast heading towards Brazil in the first leg of the race. 
 
Mr Ashman's boat, known as CV21, was part of a fleet which set sail from Tower Bridge last Sunday for the year-long race. 
 
They were in the midst of the first of 14 mini-races and just under a week into the competition when Mr Ashman died. 
 
His team have now diverted to Portugal are expected to arrive near Porto in the early hours of tomorrow morning.

236,"Around 20 people were evacuated from their homes after an ""apocalyptic"" fire broke out in a market town. 

Fire crews rescued several people trapped inside a flat as a blaze erupted in Sudbury in Suffolk this evening. 

The fire broke out in a nail salon and then locals said they heard an explosion and it quickly spread to adjoining shops and the flats upstairs. 

Hundreds of people spilled on to the street below as flames ripped through the old building and thick, black smoke billowed into the sky. 

Families, some with small children and in tears, were evacuated from their homes and given blankets by ambulance crews. 

Sarah Pheby, 28, an administrator whose flat is across the street, said: ""The fire looks apocalyptic. 

""I could feel the heat of the flames on my face when I looked at it through the window, and that was through my double glazing. 

""The first floor of the building has collapsed, it is just a shell now. The roof has gone. 

""It started in Celebrity Nails, which isn't a particularly big shop. Then there was an explosion and it just spread incredibly quickly."" 

She said firefighters in cherry pickers were sent up to people trapped in the flats above. 

She said: ""There was someone in the top floor, I hope they got out OK. I could see them in the top floor window, the firefighters went up there."" 

Around 15 fire engines and dozens of crew rushed to the town centre to tackle the blaze, which they have been battling for hours. 

Police were called at 6.25pm to help and at 7pm a full evacuation of the area was launched. 

Luke Cresswell, a teaching assistant and local councillor, said: ""I saw around 20 people being evacuated. They were given covers and looked really upset. 

""There were families including children. They looked really shaken up, some of them were crying. A couple of the young girls only looked around five or six years-old and were very upset. 

""They were given blankets and taken to the side by an ambulance where they were being looked after."" 

Others were trapped inside a flat and had to be rescued. 

Cllr Cresswell, 27, said: ""You could see them come out with firemen and women. 

""The fire is huge and proper black. I kept thinking it had died down but it flared up again. The fire is literally right in the middle of the town centre.""",d81baeec-038c-4bfe-a2c0-27eaefb53f04,News,2015-09-07T02:17:51Z,AOL UK,20 evacuated as fire tears through flats and shops,0.0,News

794,"Big Brother has sprung the old “fake eviction” twist on contestants and viewers too many times over the last decade or so. 
 
You know the drill by now – a housemate or two is booted out of the main house into a secret place where they spy on their hopefully unsuspecting former room-mates. 
 Celebrity Big Brother presenters Rylan Clark and Emma Willis (Ian West/PA) 
This twist has become more predictable than a sob story in X Factor, so tonight on Channel 5, for the first time ever, the rest of the housemates will be in on the joke. They will know from the start that it’s all fake. 
 
To celebrate this deliciously devious turn, we look back at some of our favourite fake evictions from both the celeb and non-celeb versions of the show. 
 
1. Michelle Bass and Emma Greenwood. 
 Emma Greenwood (left) and Michelle Bass (Yui Mok/PA) 
The first-ever fake eviction came during Big Brother 5 when Michelle and Emma were voted into a bedsit. 
 
They spied on the house and played pranks on their fellow housemates, including turning off the hot water every time Victor Ebuwa took a shower. 
 
However, Emma heard Victor slating her and when she confronted him about it, a huge fight kicked off. 
   Promoted stories   
Security guards intervened, the police were called and producers took the show off-air. Emma was moved back to the bedsit and then promptly evicted for real. 
 
2. Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt. 
 Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt  (Ian West/PA) 
Speidi, as these spouses are collectively known, quickly established themselves as public enemy number one during Celebrity Big Brother 11 thanks to refusals to take part in certain tasks, diva-like threats to call their lawyers and numerous heated confrontations with fellow housemates, especially eventual winner Rylan Clark (at that time, best known for The X Factor). 
 
When the Americans were given a secret mission to stage a fake walk-out, the other housemates easily believed they’d finally quit the show. 
 
However, Speidi lived in luxury in Big Brother’s pimped-out basement, listening to every bad word said about them by the other stars. Their eventual return to the main house was TV gold. 
 
3. Charley Uchea. 
 Charley Uchea (Joel Ryan/PA) 
Self-styled, argumentative south London “it-girl” Charley was fake evicted during Big Brother 8 as part of the show’s Fake Week theme. 
 
The best part of the Londoner’s bogus departure came when she emerged from the house to silence: “What’s going on guys? Where’s the cheers, man?” she asked. 
 
Charley’s “eviction interview” by then-presenter Davina McCall was watched by her stunned housemates before she went back into the house. 
 
4. Marc O’Neill. 
 Marc O’Neill (Channel 5/PA) 
As far as his fellow housemates were concerned, Big Brother 16′s Marc was loud, opinionated and annoying. In other words, he was the perfect fake eviction choice. 
 
Marc joined legendary Big Brother housemates Nikki Grahame, Helen Wood and Brian Bello in the “bunker”, where they all secretly spied on the shenanigans and exerted sole control over nominations. 
 
After listening in on private conversations, Harry Amelia Martin was chosen to face the public vote. 
 
5. Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace. 
 Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace (Yui Mok/PA) 
The most memorable moment of Aisleyne’s fake eviction? She cried enough tears to fill the Thames. This Big Brother 7 star was secretly moved to the House Next Door, with the remaining housemates believing she’d been evicted. 
 
Aisleyne was joined by five new housemates and, as part of a task, chose four to join her in the main house. However, the then-glamour model collapsed in tears after facing a final choice of evicting either Jonathan Leonard or Spiral Coroner. 
 
Aisleyne saved Spiral, and if you listen closely, you will still hear her crying over her decision to evict Jonathan. 
 
6. Casey Batchelor and Lee Ryan. 
 Casey Batchelor and Lee Ryan (Ian West/PA) 
During Celebrity Big Brother 13, the overplayed fake eviction became mesmerising viewing for the first time in ages thanks to Blue singer Lee’s horrid, torrid love triangle. 
 
The pop star had flirted with 34GG-sized glamour model Casey before transferring his affections to American actress Jasmine Waltz, rubbing his new-found attraction to her in poor Casey’s face. Ouch. 
 
That was bad enough, but then the dastardly voting public promptly forced Lee and Casey to spend time alone together in an even smaller space. It made for cringe-inducing viewing, but Big Brother fans got what they wanted.

On Sep­tem­ber 18, 2015, Omar Bargh­outi, a found­ing mem­ber of the Pales­tin­ian Cam­paign for the Aca­d­e­mic and Cul­tural Boy­cott of Israel (PACBI), spoke at the Uni­ver­sity of California-Berkeley. His pre­sen­ta­tion, which dis­cussed the role which he believes acad­e­mia should play in BDS, was spon­sored by the cam­pus Stu­dents for Jus­tice in Pales­tine (SJP) chap­ter and co-sponsored by eight dif­fer­ent Uni­ver­sity depart­ments, includ­ing the Cen­ter for Race and Gen­der, Asian Amer­i­can Stud­ies, Native Amer­i­can Stud­ies, Eth­nic Stud­ies, Eng­lish, Chi­cano Stud­ies, Near East­ern Stud­ies, and African Amer­i­can Studies. Bargh­outi, a founder of the move­ment who recently stated that he believes BDS is turn­ing main­stream, has used Holo­caust imagery to con­demn Israel and its sup­port­ers in past pre­sen­ta­tions and inter­views. He also has advo­cated for a one-state solu­tion to the Israeli-Palestinian con­flict, along with the right of return for Pales­tin­ian refugees, claim­ing that one state would mean “equal­ity for everyone–irrespective of iden­tity, eth­nic­ity, reli­gion or any other attribute.” Barghouti’s event is not unique for this year though, as the Cen­ter for Diver­sity and Inclu­sion at Michi­gan Tech­no­log­i­cal Uni­ver­sity spon­sored a sim­i­lar pre­sen­ta­tion from Israeli anti-Zionist author Miko Peled on Sep­tem­ber 15, 2015. Over the years, Peled has made sev­eral state­ments about Jews, Israel, and the Israeli-Palestinian con­flict that would not define “inclu­sion” or “diver­sity.” These state­ments include his alle­ga­tion that Israel turned Gaza into an “enor­mous con­cen­tra­tion camp” or more recently, when he stated that “nei­ther Iran, Hezbol­lah or Hamas pose a threat to Israel, they pose a threat to the Israeli occu­pa­tion and oppres­sion of Palestinians.” Other events which received depart­ment spon­sor­ship this year include an upcom­ing per­for­mance by Remi Kanazi, an Orga­niz­ing Com­mit­tee mem­ber of the US Cam­paign for the Aca­d­e­mic & Cul­tural Boy­cott of Israel (USACBI), at John Jay Col­lege. At John Jay, Kanazi’s per­for­mance is being co-sponsored by the Depart­ment of Gen­der Studies. In addi­tion, a Sep­tem­ber 16 pre­sen­ta­tion at Drew Uni­ver­sity by Bassem Tamimi, a Pales­tin­ian anti-Israel activist who has been arrested in Israel sev­eral times, was co-sponsored by the Mid­dle East Stud­ies Depart­ment; and a pre­sen­ta­tion from Vijay Prashad, the for­mer Edward Said chair in Amer­i­can Stud­ies at the Amer­i­can Uni­ver­sity of Beirut, was co-sponsored by the Ethics, Peace, and Global Affairs Program. While not all advo­cates of BDS are anti-Semitic and may be dri­ven by per­ceived legit­i­mate crit­i­cism of cer­tain Israeli poli­cies toward Pales­tini­ans, many indi­vid­u­als engaged in BDS cam­paigns are dri­ven by oppo­si­tion to Israel’s very exis­tence as a Jew­ish state. Because of this, it’s unfor­tu­nate that uni­ver­sity depart­ments would lend their spon­sor­ship to events that can cre­ate an envi­ron­ment that is hos­tile to Jew­ish and pro-Israel students.",b41fc4fd-52e6-4d75-b0b6-ef2b4c2f0bf5,Blog,2015-09-25T20:20:17Z,ADL Blogs,University Departments Sponsor Key BDS Advocates,1.0,Blog

1232,"Is your user acquisition cost too high? These are 5 mobile game marketing strategies to reduce UA cost, attract players and grow revenue organically. 

User acquisition can be a lot like that head contraption from Saw.

In the mobile game industry, paid advertising techniques on mobile devices, such as mobile ad networks, are what's typically known as user acquisition or UA.

It's the standard way to monetize mobile games.

The problem is user acquisition cost is high and rising.

And because of that, mobile game developers seem to be either closing up shop or desperately looking for ways to reduce their user acquisition cost before they have to.

The math is simple.

For a mobile game to stay profitable its user acquisition cost has to stay below its customer lifetime value (CLV).

And I'm absolutely hell-bent on helping mobile game developers reduce user acquisition cost.

That said, here are 5 actionable, mobile game marketing strategies that I want you to execute to reduce user acquisition cost, attract players and grow revenue organically...

If you're like most developers, you've got an email newsletter on your website because you know it's important, but it's also kind of a nuisance, right?

You might not have a ton of addresses so it's not super exciting to try and figure out what to send each week. And because of that, maybe you haven't sent anything in a while.

Not good.

Email is 40x better at acquiring new customers than Facebook and Twitter combined.

So here's what I want you to do...

Start investing in an 

Your offer could be an exclusive origin story, a PDF comic book or some type of in-game promo code.

In any case, it has to be something valuable enough for your audience to fork over their email addresses.

It all sounds very simple, but if you start doing this your email list will become one the best ways to grow revenue organically and reduce user acquisition cost.

Does this sound familiar? You've got an official website for your game, and it takes a lot of time and money to manage for what feels like very little return on investment.

Its primary function has really become information or PR, rather than marketing or selling games.

If that sounds familiar then you're missing a giant opportunity to generate revenue.

So, here's what I want you to do...

Convert all your official game websites into landing pages (or squeeze pages), because that's going to improve clicks through to your marketplaces.

If you're not sure how to do that please read my official game website design strategy.

Follow that guide all the way through, start growing revenue with your official game websites and start relinquishing your dependency on paid advertising.

Let's say you're a F2P mobile game with IAPs, and you're using mobile ad networks to monetize. That's the common mobile game business model.

But what inevitably happens is this...

You're going to get jealous of all the players those networks are sucking right out of your game. Your retention rate will drop and your IAP revenue will follow.

You'll be left making the vast majority of money by sending players away from your games.

User acquisition is a lot like that head contraption from Saw.

And there's a lot of mobile game developers struggling to get out of it.

Here's what helps unlock that...

Instead of relying 100% on mobile ad networks to monetize your games implement native advertising with the goal of increasing IAPs.

For example, let's say your game is Super Mario Bros 3 and a player finds a magic flute. They should see a 3-tier, native advertisement asking them which world they'd like to warp to and at what cost.

Rolling your own native advertising is one of the best ways for F2P mobile games to grow revenue and reduce user acquisition cost. 

400 million people around the world use Dropbox, the standard in cloud storage accessible from any device anywhere. But I don't want to talk about storage.

I want to talk about those 400 million users.

In the startup world, that's unbelievable. And it's a known fact Dropbox spent very little on advertising.

So, how'd they do it?

They did it with incentivized referrals.

When you sign up for a free Dropbox account you get 2 GB of storage. But if you refer it to a friend and they sign up too, Dropbox adds another 500 MB to your account.

And I want you to do the same type of thing for your games. It's called an incentivized referral program.

You've no doubt a reward system in your game. Utilize that system to leverage referrals from your players because that'll encourage organic shares, expanding your audience at a rapid pace.

Marketing channels are places online where you talk about or post content about your games, such as websites, forums, social media and email newsletters.

And every day you post new content in those channels such as screenshots, memes, trailers, video, articles, interviews and so on.

The problem is, everyone's basically getting the same information about your games wherever they go.

Nothing's exclusive.

So, here's what I want you to do…

Reserve big content reveals for only certain marketing channels.

For example, what if Twitter was the only place online where people could see new screenshots of your game? Here's what you might post in other channels to encourage followers...

Want to see our game before anyone else? Follow us on Twitter where every Saturday we post 3 exclusive, never-before-seen screenshots of [game]!

This strategy immediately does three things:

It increases your social audience because people have an incentive (1). It increases the value of your content because it's exclusive (2). And it increases total shares because your audience will want to be the person who shares it for you (3).

Content exclusivity is a powerful strategy for building an audience and reducing user acquisition cost.

User acquisition, or paid advertising techniques on mobile devices, isn't the only way to sell mobile games.

Don't buy into the lie, literally or figuratively.

There are dozens of ways to reduce user acquisition cost. And when you start taking into account your specific game's experience, there's exponentially more.

2292,"THERE'S nothing better than fresh herbs and vegetables from your own garden. With temperatures warming now's the time to start planning for produce such as lettuce, spinach, peas, zucchini, pumpkin, tomatoes and strawberries. 
 
 Step 1. Prepare the soil  
 
Before you plant any vegetables, prepare your garden beds by digging the soil and adding organic compost at least 1-2 weeks before you start planting. Most vegetables only need 15-20 centimetres of good soil for their roots to grow. If you're planning to grow crops with deeper roots, like potatoes or carrots, dig and compost deeper - up to 30 centimetres. Water-in the compost and let it break down before you plant your vegetables. To get the most out of your vegetable garden, choose vegetables that you will use and plant seasonally. 
 
 Step 2: Planting seeds  
 
Draw a line in the soil with your finger to the depth prescribed for your chosen vegetable seed. Sow seeds at the specified distance apart and cover with soil. Water well. 
   
 Step 3: Planting spinach  
 
Spinach is a good source of vitamin A and one of the healthiest sources of minerals and nutrients that you can grow. Gently remove the spinach plants from their container and separate each plant. Use the gardening trowel to dig a hole deep enough, so that the leaves are sitting just above the soil and cover the roots. Plant the rest of the spinach in a row, about 30 centimetres apart. 
 
 Step 4: Planting peas  
 
Peas are easy to grow and also help to improve the soil you're growing them in. Take each pea plant out of its container. Dig a hole deep enough for the peas, so the leaves are sitting just above the soil. Put the peas in the hole, and then fill it in. When planting your peas, remember that they will need some kind of support as they grow, so take that into account when working out the distance between them. Ideally they should be about 30 centimetres apart. 
 
 Step 5: Planting onions  
 
Onions are a popular vegetable because they are easy to grow and don't take up a lot of space in your garden. After taking the onion seedlings out of their container, separate each plant by gently washing them in a bucket of water to get rid of the soil. Separate each plant and dig a shallow trench. Plant each onion plant in the trench and cover the roots with soil. 
   
 Step 6: Fertilise your vegetable plants  
 
Vegetables need regular fertilising when they're growing. To give yours a good head start, and to help with the shock of being transplanted, dilute a seaweed concentrate, approximately two capfuls in 10 litres of water in a watering can. Soak your vegetables in this mixture. 
 
 Step 7: Apply mulch  
 
Mulch helps your plants grow in a number of ways. As it breaks down it will provide nitrogen to the soil and your plants, keep the roots cool in summer and stop weeds from growing in your vegetable garden. Apply the mulch around your vegetable plants but not touching them. If the mulch gets wet it can rot the plant. 
 
 Step 8: Water the vegetables  
 
To give your vegetable garden a good start, water the plants at least every day for the first few days. Then reduce the amount of water you give them, which will encourage the plant's roots to grow deeper as they look for water. This will also help the plant to grow, establish itself and produce home-grown food for your kitchen table.

- During its first year of operations, Vtesse advances lead program into late-stage, pivotal trial and launches www.theNPCstudy.com

- Goal is to establish a clear foundational data set on the safety and efficacy of VTS-270 for treatment of NPC

GAITHERSBURG, Md. 

NPC is a progressive, irreversible, chronically debilitating – and ultimately lethal – genetic disease. It is caused by a defect in lipid transportation within the cell, which leads to excessive accumulation of lipids in the brain, liver and spleen. Vtesse has worked extensively with regulators in the United States 

Ben Machielse, Drs., President and Chief Executive Officer of Vtesse, Inc., said, ""Starting the pivotal clinical trial for VTS-270 within nine months of the company's launch underscores our dedication to serve the NPC community. A key ingredient that enabled us to start the trial so quickly is the complete package of high-quality pre-clinical data that clearly outlines the potential benefits of VTS-270, such as prolonged survival and preservation of neurons, as well as encouraging clinical data from the Phase 1 trial. The pivotal trial will allow us to further evaluate safety and efficacy of VTS-270 to build a foundational dataset for the NPC community.""

He added, ""While initiation of the first site at Rush University 

Vtesse's Phase 2b/3 prospective, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial of VTS-270 will be conducted in patients affected by NPC disease. The trial will take place in up to 20 centers in the United States 

Preliminary analyses of the Phase 1 trial, conducted post-hoc, suggest that the rate of disease progression had slowed down (based on a standardized measure) in children treated with VTS-270 as compared to the rate in an age- and disease severity-matched cohort obtained from a separate natural history study of NPC patients.

The VTS-270 pivotal study addresses a pressing need to discover new treatments for the disease, according to Forbes D. Porter 

""The recent analysis of the preliminary Phase 1 clinical data for VTS-270 has provided encouraging support suggesting this treatment for NPC may be able to alter the course of this fatal disease,"" said Elizabeth Berry-Kravis, M.D., Ph.D., Co-Principal Investigator of the Phase 2b/3 study, and Professor of Pediatrics, Neurological Sciences, Biochemistry, Rush University Medical Center. ""The beginning of patient screening for the pivotal Phase 2b/3 study for VTS-270 marks another important step in the journey toward targeted treatment of NPC, as clinical trials are the only means to determine the effectiveness of VTS-270. This pivotal trial will allow us to gather the data required to advance the regulatory process and move toward U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval for VTS-270.""

More information on this Phase 2b/3 study can be found at Vtesse's clinical trial website: www.theNPCstudy.com. Vtesse launched the website this summer as a resource to patients, parents, caregivers and physicians. For more information on enrollment criteria, please see: www.theNPCstudy.com/trialenrollment. 

About VTS-270

Vtesse's lead compound, VTS-270, has shown promise in pre-clinical and clinical studies as a potential treatment for NPC. It is a well-characterized mixture of (2-hydroxypropyl)-beta-cyclodextrin that has been extensively evaluated in pre-clinical and clinical studies at the National Institutes of Health, as well as under individual compassionate-use Investigational New Drug applications (iINDs) and in other academic labs. Most recently, Vtesse announced positive clinical results from the on-going Phase 1 study that demonstrated VTS-270 stabilizes the overall measures of NPC while improving certain disease measures. NPC is a genetic disease affecting an estimated one in 100,000 to 150,000 children and is often misdiagnosed and/or under-diagnosed. Affected patients are usually identified in early childhood with ataxia, exhibit progressive impairment of motor and intellectual function, and often die before adulthood. 

About Vtesse

Vtesse, Inc. is a rare disease company dedicated to developing drugs for patients suffering from diseases that are underserved. Vtesse is working collaboratively with the NIH and other leading academic centers to advance clinical study of VTS-270 for NPC, and to conduct pre-clinical discovery and development of other novel drugs for NPC and other lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs). Vtesse is led by a highly experienced management team that has been involved in the development of more than 20 approved drugs and vaccines. Its experienced consortium of investors, led by New Enterprise Associates, has committed initial funding that is expected to bring this compound through pivotal clinical trial. Vtesse is based in Gaithersburg, Maryland

We’ll start with a bump pic… Weight Gained: By 20 weeks I gained 11 lbs total. Wk 21= +0 lbs, Wk 22= +2 lbs, Wk 23= +1 lb, Wk 24= +0 lb. So by week 24 I gained 14 lbs total. Symptoms: I tend to over heat more easily. I’ve noticed I get much sweatier than normal in body pump. TMI- I also get constipated regularly and only poop (hey, everyone does it!) every few days. For me, that’s out of the norm. I was a regular once-a-day-er, haha. My feet and belly seem to be more swollen/bigger by the end of the day. Nothing crazy or uncomfortable, just noticeable. Food Cravings/Aversions: Again this update, nothing out of the ordinary. I’ve been keeping an eye on my sugars and only indulging once a week (although I tend to over indulge), and that doesn’t even include froyo/soft serve ;) Good news though, I passed my glucose test! I’ve been eating a lot of nut butters and nuts in general. I tend to keep dipping the spoon in the jar or my hand in the container. Misc: I bought some new workout clothes that fit better. I never liked tight tops when running, but now I’m all about them to show off my bump!  My mom got me some work pants that I really like. I won this Mud Love bracelet from Carlee’s Blog. I got to pick which word I wanted off a list and I went with “family” because a) family is everything b) my family is always there for me and c) I’m starting my own family. All good things to remember and think about throughout the day. Workouts: Took things easy after my big race last Sunday ;) J/K, it was only a 5k. This week was the same as most. I’m just happy to be able to run still <3 Mon– Rest
Tues– 1 m walk on tread/ Body Pump
Wed– 4m on tread @ 9:22 pace
Thurs– 1.5 m walk on tread/ Body Pump
Fri– 4m on tread @ 9:15 pace
Sat– Body Pump
Sun– 1 hr on the Elliptical This bruise from the glucose test was especially fun to show off at body pump. My veins are full and plump, but small, so I almost always bruise after giving blood. It was really fun when I had to give blood every few days for a month for the IUI. Hopefully people don’t think I’m doing drugs while pregnant, haha. I doubt they do. I’m sure it’ll look good on the elliptical on Sunday, too when my arm stretches out holding the handles (or whatever they’re called.) Linking up with Erin for my weekend snapshot.

You're right about AvC having been  more conducive to constructive debate some years ago, but part of the reason it no longer is is that so many of the reasonable debaters have dropped out leaving the door wide open to those who only ridicule and provoke with too little opposition. When reasonable people drop out the climate is bound to change and it's seldom a positive change.

808,"Dear Volkswagen: 

I want my money back. 
 
Two years ago, when I went shopping for a new car for the first time in 10 years, I ended up buying one of yours: A 2014 Passat TDI. 

Part of your Clean Diesel lineup, the sales manager told me, it was a car that would allow me to be environmentally responsible while enjoying superior fuel economy. 
 
I actually thought she was serious. 

Now I know better. 

Turns out the impressive emissions numbers you touted in your ads and showrooms were fraudulent. It wasn't innovative engineering that made those numbers possible, but some software sleight-of-hand that allowed your clean diesel engines to enable emissions controls when government regulators were watching and turn them off during ordinary driving. 

I'm not an engineer, but I recognize the technology you employed to disguise your cars' exhaust fumes as a variation on the tactic parolees use to conceal drug use from their parole officers. 

A few years ago, I wrote about a product called the Whizzinator, which was designed, like Volkswagen's emissions software, primarily to deceive government regulators. 

Available in a variety of flesh tones designed to accommodate every (male) customer, the Whizzinator used a plastic penis to deliver untainted urine from a concealed reservoir to a specimen cup under the scrutiny of vigilant parole officers, bypassing the test subject's own organs and any incriminating waste products they might house. 

Substitute some sophisticated software code for the Whizzinator's crude plumbing and you have the tactic Volkswagen used to deceive EPA officials testing the automakers' vehicles for illegal levels of air pollution. 

When the EPA called foul on your company last week, I hesitated to believe its allegations. After all, it was my own judgment the agency was implicating as well as yours. 

As a journalist, I take some pride in my capacity to discern when someone is misleading me, whether unwittingly or deliberately. So I waited all weekend for your official response, hoping Volkswagen would provide evidence that the EPA was mistaken or, at the very least, that the company, too, had been deceived by a handful of renegade employees. 

But when CEO Martin Winterkorn finally broke his silence Sunday, he offered no extenuating circumstances that might mitigate the company's culpability for the clean diesel hoax. 

“I personally am deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public,” Winterkorn, who resigned Wednesday, said in a statement. 

Like most apologies for cheating, your CEO's would have been more impressive if he'd made it before he was caught with his pants down.  

The bottom line, then, is that you lied to me and everyone else who purchased one of your clean diesel vehicles. I then amplified your deception, however unwittingly, by boasting that my new vehicle was not only more fuel-efficient than most of neighbors' but cleaner as well. 

And for that, you owe me more than a belated admission of guilt. 

I don't know if I'll ever receive a penny of compensation for that deception, or its negative impact on the resale value of my now 20-month-old fraud-mobile. 

But I know I've purchased my last Volkswagen vehicle. 

Whizz me once, shame on you; Whizz me twice, shame on me.

1673,"TAULUPE FALETAU knows the pool of death can breath life into Wales' World Cup bid. 
Four years ago in New Zealand, Faletau played every minute of a thrilling Welsh campaign that began with him scoring against the Springboks and ended inches short of the final. 

This time England, Australia, Fiji and Uruguay stand in Wales' way in arguably the toughest group in World Cup history. 

But Faletau said: ""All that competition will only benefit the two teams that get through to the knockout stages and hopefully we will be one of them. 

""In New Zealand we got so much belief from the pool and built momentum. Of course you look back with real disappointment at the France game, but it just wasn't meant to be. 

""There is no getting around the fact we have a tough group again. It's up for anybody to take and Fiji should not be overlooked. 

""They've got a strong squad and will give everyone a run for their money. They have been in good form to win the Pacific Nations Cup and have all their big players fit and available. 

""Whoever gets through will be in good shape because they will have had competitive rugby from the start."" 

Faletau knows what he is in for. During the pool stage alone he will potentially come up against his cousin Billy Vunipola, former team-mate Netani Talei and familiar opponents Australia. 

""I've played against Billy a few times now but it will be extra special if we do again at the World Cup,"" he said. 

""They've always been good battles, just like they were when my brother and I would play Billy and Mako when we were kids growing up in south Wales. 

""But this time it will be all about England versus Wales and it's nothing personal. 

""Ben Morgan got the nod for the Fiji game with Billy on the bench and they have different qualities but are both dangerous players. Billy won't settle for that and will be determined to start against us. 

""It's great to see Netani there with Fiji after his injury problems. He is a hard-working guy and has got what he deserves by making the squad. 

""As for Australia, having two out-and-out sevens obviously strengthens them at the breakdown. They are quality players and it will be interesting to see what Australia do."" 

Four years ago in New Zealand, according to Warren Gatland, little-known Faletau was ""an overweight Tongan"", recognisable only for his mop of hair. But his transformation is now complete. 

In a record back-row partnership with Dan Lydiate and Sam Warburton, he has been at the heart of one of the most successful Wales teams of all time. He has started the last 19 Tests for Wales and barely misses a training session. 

Now Faletau is ready to become more than just Mr Reliable as he peaks once again for the World Cup. 

""It was new territory for me four years ago - I'd never travelled with the squad before and suddenly I was visiting these great places and playing in all the games,"" he said. 

""There is a group of us now that have come through together. We've had time together and understand each other better. We've got to try and build on that and use the experience that we've gained over the last four years to go one better than last time.""",874a583b-ddf0-4528-a02e-49b9a5359462,News,2015-09-16T21:30:00Z,Daily Express,Taulupe Faletau hoping pool of death can fire Wales to World Cup glory,0.0,Blog
1061,"-- Field Engineers and Technicians Can Conduct RF Tests on RRH at Ground Level to Reduce Base Station OpEx -- 

MORGAN HILL, Calif., Sept. 8, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Anritsu Company introduces a CPRI RF Measurement option for its BTS Master™ handheld base station analyzer family that can significantly reduce the operational expense (OpEx) associated with troubleshooting interference at base stations. Featuring best-in-class sweep speed and unique test capabilities, the BTS Master-based CPRI RF measurement test set allows field engineers and technicians to conduct accurate RF measurements on Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) while remaining at ground level, eliminating the considerable expense and time associated with calling a tower crew to conduct interference measurements. 

With the new option installed, the BTS Master can conduct RF measurements over the fiber optic CPRI link connecting the baseband unit (BBU) and RRH. To simplify configuring the CPRI link for RF measurements, Anritsu has developed preconfigured radio setups and an auto detect function in the option. 

A sweep speed 10x faster than other solutions in its class allows the BTS Master-based CPRI RF measurement test set to capture bursty signals missed by alternative methods. Complementing the sweep speed are two unique features – the ability to tune and pan on a displayed signal, and to zoom into a particular area of interest. Faster sweep speeds and more detailed signal analysis allow field engineers and technicians to more efficiently locate the sources of interference and PIM. 

Users can conduct CPRI Spectrum and CPRI Spectrogram measurements with the test set. The overall performance and capability give operations and maintenance groups, RF performance engineers, NEM performance groups and other professionals responsible for wireless network optimization the ability to conduct all the required tests without the cost and time associated with dispatching a tower crew.    

The CPRI RF option expands the comprehensive measurement capability of the BTS Master family, which consists of the MT8820T, MT8221B and MT8222B. All the handheld base station analyzers have been specifically developed to support 2G/3G/4G wireless networks, and feature over 30 analyzers in one instrument to meet virtually every measurement need. 

Anritsu also offers a portfolio of optical transport testers to test and verify the CPRI links. These solutions leverage Anritsu's extensive optical test history and can be used to confirm the RRH is powered-up correctly, that the fibers are connected correctly, the condition and cleanliness of the optical connector, and that the link has no excess loss from the RRH to the BBU. The transport testers can also verify that the correct wavelength SFP/SFP+ modules are installed and that the modules support the rate configured.

3930,"Kinder Morgan issued a statement late today (Sept. 30) describing the benefits of the company's proposed Northeast Energy Direct natural gas pipeline. Kimberly S. Watson, president of Kinder Morgan's east region gas pipelines division, said there is a critical need for additional natural gas capacity in New England to stabilize energy prices. Watson made reference to today's trip to Washington by state Senate President Stanley Rosenberg. Rosenberg met with members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to discuss his constituents' concerns about the proposed pipeline, and also met with Dept. of Energy officials and members of Congress on matters of energy policy. Watson said she appreciated Rosenberg's efforts to involve his constituents in the federal permitting process for the proposed pipeline. The statement was issued through Crawford Strategies, a Boston-based public relations firm.  The 212-mile 30-inch line, which would cut through sections of New York, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, has met with strong opposition in the senator's district. Rosenberg has not taken a stand on the pipeline's merits, but has said he wishes to ensure a ""deliberative process"" as Kinder Morgan pursues federal approval for the project. Watson issued the following statement late Wednesday afternoon: ""We appreciate Senate President Rosenberg's efforts as the state reviews its energy strategy.
""As numerous studies have shown, there is a critical need for additional natural gas capacity in New England to stabilize sky-high electricity prices that burden residents and businesses and to support the state's objective of increasing the percentage of renewable energy. ""The NED project will help the Massachusetts economy grow both statewide and across New England. It will also help the state's impressive climate change objectives by reducing reliance on coal and fuel oil. ""Unlike other regions in the country, which are benefiting from cleaner and less costly natural gas, Massachusetts and the region will continue to pay billions more per year for its energy needs without additional natural gas capacity. ""In the development of renewable energy resources, natural gas is widely identified as the ideal bridge fuel for the intermittent nature of renewables and would, in fact, hasten a faster deployment of solar and wind energy in the state. ""We appreciate the Senate President's initiative in creating opportunities for his constituents' voices to be heard in the FERC process. We look forward to working with all interested parties who wish to participate in the process so that the best decisions can be made."" Kinder Morgan announced this week that its subsidiary Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. had executed additional agreements with anchor shippers for capacity on the proposed line. National Grid, Liberty Utilities, Columbia Gas, Connecticut Natural Gas, Southern Connecticut Gas, Berkshire Gas, and Westfield Gas & Electric were announced in March. Recently, more unnamed entities have signed up for a combined 675,000 dekatherms of capacity, according to Kinder Morgan. In March, the number hovered around 500,000 dekatherms. FERC, in its upcoming evaluation of the pipeline, will consider whether the project is economically sound, and balance benefits against adverse impacts. Kinder Morgan will seek a certificate from the federal regulators this fall. Rosenberg told reporters on Tuesday that he sees a ""disconnect"" between policy makers pushing green energy and regulatory agencies such as FERC and the state Dept. of Public Utilities, saying they are bound by outdated statutes.

5597,"The city of Cochin, located in the Indian state of Kerala, is known for its breathtaking coastline, delectable seafood and some of the most pristine forest cover in India. CIAL Cochin itself is home to a confluence of cultures and influences best represented by its spice markets and the enormous Chinese fishing nets from the middle ages, still operating from its harbour. A few weeks ago Cochin chalked up another milestone for itself: The Cochin International Airport became the world's largest to operate entirely on solar power. The 12 MWp solar plant was constructed by German engineering giant Bosch; made of 46,150 solar panels laid across 45 acres near the cargo complex.

Huawei: Don't call us cheap Not going it alone: Samsung brings S-Health app to non-Samsung Android phones South Korea leads the iOS 9 charge, as nearly one in five Apple users upgrade The airport saw 6.8 million passengers pass through it last year, which to put in context, is roughly 500,000 more than the number of people who streamed through Ohio's Port Columbus Airport last year. As far as green benchmarks are concerned, the combined solar capacity at Cochin Airport (12 MW+1.1 MW) narrowly outstrips the solar PV system installed at the Indianapolis International Airport -- a single 12.5 MW system located on the ground. The Baltra Airport in the Galapagos Islands, while far smaller than these two, runs entirely on a combination of solar and wind power.
Cochin Airport consists of a 100 kilowatt peak (kWp) rooftop photovoltaic (PV) plant that was actually built in 2013 to test the waters. The airport authorities then followed up with a 1 MWp PV plant that was divided between the rooftop and the ground at its aircraft maintenance hangar facility. Then came the most recent 12 MW plant.
Cochin Airport doesn't have any battery storage -- instead its 50,000 to 60,000 units of power more than provide for the airport's functioning, and excess power is sold to the grid. This means that it can easily buy back any power that it may need to operate during the night.
As it stands however, the airport is entirely grid neutral, and according to the Airport Authority's website, the amount of carbon emissions it would save over the next 25 years has been calculated to be equivalent to planting 3 million trees or not driving 750 million miles (1.2 billion km). That's not the airport's only impressive feat. The $10 million project will apparently recover these funds in just five years of operation through energy savings alone. India has turned out to be a global front runner in the use of solar power, where the National Solar Mission has targeted a staggering 100 GW of installed solar capacity, upped from the 22GW target that was in place not long ago. Bolstered by the success of Cochin Airport, the Airport Authority of India -- which operates 125 airports across the country -- has now planned another 30 solar-powered airports, which will make a unique feat in a country starved of electricity, if the plans come through.",5f5686c9-8cc4-4563-93fc-ec7d918c4fc6,Blog,2015-09-22T01:39:00Z,Latest articles for ZDNet,Indian city of Cochin powers entire airport through solar,1.0,News

3477,"(BPT) - George Washington is the “father of our country” yet, ironically, he didn’t leave any legitimate (or illegitimate) children in his wake. 
  
As author Steve Yoch describes in his recent book “Becoming George Washington,” at 19, Washington traveled to Barbados with his brother who was dying of tuberculosis and searching for a cure. The trip was a failure. Not only did his brother’s condition continue to deteriorate, but Washington contracted smallpox. Although he survived — and only half of those with the disease were so lucky — it was not without long-term ramifications. He showed the telltale signs of the disease: pockmarks on his forehead and nose and a prolonged fever that likely made him sterile. 
 
At 27, Washington married Martha Custis, a widow who had already given birth to two young healthy children — Jacky and Patsy. Thus, Washington’s lack of offspring cannot be laid at Martha's feet. Washington was a loving stepfather to the young children he’d inherited with his marriage. Unfortunately, both children met early, tragic ends. 
 
Patsy died in his arms in an epileptic fit before the Revolution. The day after her death, Washington wrote to his brother-in-law, “It is an easier matter to concede than to describe the distress of this family, especially that of the unhappy parent of our dear Patsy Custis, when I inform you that yesterday removed the sweet, innocent girl into a more happy and peaceful abode than any she has met in the afflicted path she hithered to as trod.” 
 
Jacky was a dandy who did not fight in the war. With Martha’s encouragement, Washington brought Jacky with him to the siege at Yorktown that ended the War. Jacky, who was inexperienced in unsanitary camp life, promptly caught cholera and died at age 26.  
 
By the time the Revolution ended, the “father of our country” was father to no one. In a draft of Washington’s first inaugural address, he wrote: “Divine providence hath not seen fit that my blood should be transmitted, or my name perpetuated by the enduring, though sometimes seducing, channel of immediate offspring. I have no child for whom I could wish to make a provision — no family to build in greatness upon my country’s ruins.” 
 
As Yoch notes, “This may have been a fortunate happenstance, as many called for him to be America’s new king. His lack of children allowed him to truly act in the country’s best interests and sealed his legacy as 'first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.'”

2693,"""Have you done this before?"" I ask one of our guides. ""Have you done this before?"" I ask one of our guides. ""Yes, I've done it,"" he responds.

""Are you going to do it again today?""

""No, I'll never do it again!""

Hmm. It seemed like a fun idea when first suggested. Taking a dip in the near-freezing waters of Deception Island during an expedition cruise of the Antarctic is something of a rite of passage for adventurous travellers. But, after days of brilliant - if not warm - sunshine and still air, this morning on the black sand beach of Whalers Bay, we're faced with overcast skies and a biting wind. It had to be today that the weather turned ugly.

To top things off, I've forgotten to bring my bathers with me. On a trip to one of the harshest environments on the planet, it didn't really occur to me that I might want to go for a swim. Nevertheless, I've mentally committed myself to doing it and I can't back out now. Even if it means stripping off to my underwear.

Our crew from One Ocean cruises offer some advice - explore the island at a brisk pace while under the full gamut of layers. The exercise in heavy clothes will help raise our body temperatures before we take our dip.

So I take the advice and wander around this huge, bleak beach. Whalers Bay, as the name suggests, is the home of a former whaling station and later a British scientific base. It is also home to an active volcano that, after erupting in the 1960s, saw the location abandoned. Now it is an eerie location, with run-down, partially collapsed buildings dotted across the landscape, home only to sea lions and the occasional penguin.

Of course, these creatures are much more adapted to the environment than we are. The sea lions play around in the shallow waters of the edge of the bay, paying little attention to the visiting tourists. They look like they're having a great time in that water, I think to myself, so maybe it won't be so bad.

After an hour or so exploring the island, the moment arrives - those of us who are going to swim are told it's time to face the music. We're taking our plunge at the end of the visit so that we can immediately board zodiacs to be taken back to our ship, Russian science vessel the Akademik Ioffe, and hit the warm showers (or, alternatively, the on-board hot tub or dry sauna).

The wind has picked up and, while not exactly howling, has raised the chill factor considerably. But there's nothing to be done. Along with plenty of other fellow lunatics from on board, I start stripping off my many layers.

This takes rather a long time, since I'm wearing seven. Soon enough, I'm down to my thermal underwear. I reluctantly remove these items and finally my socks, which touch the cold sand with a shudder. Then I run for the water.

They call it ""polar plunge"" and indeed a plunge is all it is. The water is so cold you can't afford to spend more than a few seconds in it. There's no slowly wading out and letting your body adjust here. Speed is the key.

My legs hit the water but I press forward without taking the time to register how cold the water is. I'm committed. I press on until the depth is over my knees and then dive in head-first, plunging under the surface.

It's cold, to be sure, but the adrenalin coursing through my body prevents me from truly experiencing the shock. I push myself back above the surface, get to my feet … and start running back to the shore, where the crew await with towels.

I grab a towel and start drying off. At this point something strange happens with my body - rather than feeling cold and shivering, I instead feel fairly comfortable. In fact, my skin suddenly feels very hot. I slowly but surely put my many layers back on. It turns out my lack of bathers has a benefit - the, ahem, limited surface area of my underpants means I'm not stuck with too much wet clothing on under my warm clothes.

Perhaps from the adrenalin rush, the experience already feels rather like a dream. It was over so fast that it's hard to recall how I felt when I hit the water.

Soon after, I'm back on the ship, under a hot shower and washing piles of black, volcanic sand out of my socks and underwear. I've crossed this particular experience off my bucket list, but unlike some of my guides, I think I'd be up for giving it another go. After all, the world has two polar regions. Trip notes

3883,"Former Sex Pistols frontman John Lydon has said he is still bitter about “being banned” from BBC radio after speaking out against Jimmy Savile. 
 
Lydon, better known as Johnny Rotten, has referred to an interview he did back in 1978, in which he commented that Savile was “into all sorts of seediness. We all know about it but we’re not allowed to talk about it”. 
 
He told Piers Morgan on Life Stories: “I did my bit, I said what I had to (but they didn’t air that). I found myself banned from BBC radio for quite a while, for my contentious behaviour. They wouldn’t state this directly, there’d be other excuses.” 
 (ITV) 
Formed in 1975, the Sex Pistols went on to become one of the most well-known and notorious British bands of all time. 
 
Pundits credit them with inspiring the punk rock movement, and charismatic frontman Lydon became known for his raucous behaviour. 
 
“We became so big so quick that it was too earth shattering to really deal with sensibly. We had no prospects of fame and all of that and I think that shows. That’s why the quality of the Sex Pistols is still there,” he said. 
 (Mathew McCarthy/AP) 
His former band mate, Steve Jones, gave him his “Johnny Rotten” moniker, after commenting on the state of his teeth. 
   Promoted stories   
Lydon said: “Bad teeth. In my childhood, the only time I saw a toothbrush used was my dad cleaning boots. There was bits missing (in my teeth), all cracked up, I’d avoid the dentist.” 
 
The band broke up in 1978, and Lydon went on to launch a solo career. 
 
These days life is infinitely quieter for the former wild child, and he is married to Nora Foster, who he says is the “best person in the world I’ve ever known”. 
 (ITV) 
Apart from their anarchic public image and behaviour, the band also had to deal with the death of former member Sid Vicious, who died after being released on bail for the murder of his girlfriend Nancy Spungen. 
 
Vicious’s death from a heroin overdose in 1979 was a fate that Lydon said was “inevitable”. 
 
“Sid was my mate and all that, but I watched him slowly destroy himself. I’ve got to be honest – it came as no surprise,” he told Morgan. “It wasn’t overwhelmingly catastrophic, he killed himself – as most people who mess about with heroin, they lose their souls way earlier, it’s just waiting for the body to keel over.”

Just a month after announcing his break-up with fellow “The Muppets” star Miss Piggy, Kermit the Frog has been spotted with his new girlfriend, another pig named Denise. As soon as photos of Kermit’s new ladylove surfaced, fans could not help but notice how much she looks like “Game of Thrones” star Natalie Dormer. 

According to Huffington Post, netizens started commenting about the resemblance when ABC released photos of Denise as part of the promotions for the upcoming “The Muppets” comeback on ABC. 

One netizen posted side by side photos of Denise and Natalie Dormer. The actress plays the seductive young Queen Margaery Tyrell in the hit HBO series “Game of Thrones. 

” 

Kermit and Miss Piggy jointly announced their split on Aug. 5 through statements posted on their respective Twitter accounts. They also spoke about the split during the Television Critics Association’s 2015 summer press tour. Entertainment Weekly senior writer Natalie Abrams confirmed that Kermit admitted that he is dating a new pig named Denise during the TCA interview. ""Kermit is currently dating a pig named Denise, who works for ABC marketing,"" she tweeted.

1398,"Minority neighborhoods across the country are being repackaged for investment geared towards whiter residents and investors On Monday, President Barack Obama said that the move to officially reinstate the name Denali, which means “the high one” in Athabascan, was “a step to reflect the heritage of Alaska Natives”.

Denali may no longer be called after a white American president, but many urban spaces in the US continue to have their heritage stripped from them, and given white-friendly names.

Even as Alaskan lawmakers and Native rights groups celebrated, others across the country point out that the “Christopher Columbus syndrome” lives on. The term was popularized last year by Spike Lee as he spoke up against gentrification; it refers to white culture’s propensity for claiming discovery and identity rights on spaces already named by other groups.

Minority neighborhoods across the country are regularly subjected to this exercise as they find themselves rebranded and stripped from any association with non-white culture.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest In the process of being gentrified: Gowanus in Brooklyn. Photograph: Alamy In New York, South Bronx is now routinely referred to as SoBro, which is arguably trendier-sounding. Part of West Harlem, the area directly to the north of Columbia University and currently being redeveloped by the higher education monster, is now Manhattanville in the minds of many. To cash in on Harlem and attract new residents and investors in the early 2000s, its west 110th to 125th street section was also renamed SoHa (South Harlem).

In Detroit, an area once known as the Cass Corridor has been rebranded Midtown. 

In Washington, DC, a section of the north-east part of the city has been rebranded NoMa (north of Massachusetts Avenue). 

In the early 2000s in Los Angeles, south-central LA was stripped of its full name and rebranded South LA after a unanimous vote by the city’s council on the matter.

What do all of these neighborhoods have in common? They were all majority non-white when rebranded and repackaged for investment geared towards whiter residents and investors. The connotations many of them carried pre-renaming were of high-crime, dangerous areas that white people may have feared putting their toes in.

But for Dorothy Pirtle, a 34-year-old community and economic development consultant born and raised in South-Central LA, rebranding her neighborhood felt like more of an exercise in erasure than anything else.

“For most folks who live and belong in these areas, it doesn’t make sense,” she says. Changing the name of her neighborhood was “disruptive” to her fellow community members, she says, but not in a way that seemed to benefit them.

“When they renamed it, there wasn’t any increase in the quality of our lives,” she says. Underlying issues, including low employment and low high school graduation rates, were not addressed. 

Today, citizens who want to go to the library and research the history of their community will be harder pushed to find information and knowledge, she says, because of the intentional erasure of the name. The history of south-central LA is, of course, of particular significance. It is where, in 1992, days of civil and racial unrest unfolded following the shocking and brutal attack by police officers on black motorist Rodney King. Despite being videotaped and revealing what seemed to many like excessive use of force by the police, the officers in the incident were acquitted. 

Facebook Twitter Pinterest South-central: now South LA. Photograph: David McNew/ Real estate-led rebranding 

What invariably changes after a rebranding exercise isn’t a drop in inequality levels, but a rise in property prices.

In New York, high-end real estate specialist Spencer Means (whose past clients have actually included Spike Lee among others of the city’s black elite), says there is no doubt that the branding of a neighborhood makes property value go up. Rebranding is about “pushing borders, pushing the envelope and trying to attach value to place”.

Neighborhoods such as Bushwick are laden with connotations – including those about racial makeup – that might justify it being renamed East Williamsburg from a real estate point of view, he explained. 

Bushwick was the site of some controversy last year when a luxury condo called Colony 1209 asked bohemians to become “settlers” in “Brooklyn’s vibrant new frontier”. (Colony 1209 has since its name to a less offensive 1209 Dekalb).

Davarian Baldwin, a professor in American Studies at Trinity College, says there are two starkly different ways in which American city neighborhoods get rebranded. The first is grassroots-led, which happens in a minority of cases. The second is real estate-led. 

Rebranding driven by real estate is a worrying concept, since real estate has been a driver and sustainer of racial inequality along economic lines – whether through overt, federally sanctioned redlining practices starting in the 1930s, or via disadvantageous bank lending practices up until the present day.

As such, erasing one name and inventing another signals a continued disregard for non-white communities, Baldwin says.

In an article based on research in Philadelphia published earlier this year, Harvard doctoral candidate Jackelyn Hwang found that black, long term residents in a rapidly changing community tended to identify with large geographical boundaries that were inclusive of a broad sense of longstanding black identity – in this case, “south Philly”.

White, often newer residents tended to define their neighborhoods in a much more hyper-localized way, with matching new names (including “Graduate Hospital”, “G-Ho” and “So-So”) that explicitly excluded areas deemed blacker, sometimes also defined as having higher levels of crime by these white resident (erroneously, as the author points out) as having higher levels of crime. 

As white residents used new, unconventional, smaller and more exclusionary boundaries and names to define their neighborhoods, their definitions took hold.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest A vacant, boarded up house in the once thriving Brush Park neighbourhood in downtown Detroit. Photograph: Rebecca Cook/Corbis In Detroit, which is often treated as a blank slate ready for takeover, Antonio Cosme, a 27-year-old farmer, artist and community organizer, has watched as the streets of his neighbourhood have been rebranded into a community named “Springwells Village”, a name neither he, nor the residents of the streets it encompasses, feel has any accurate historical meaning.

“Most people identify as being from south-west Detroit more broadly,” Cosme says. Historically, a Springwells Village existed, but not technically in the area it has been repositioned. 

Cosme wonders if the rebranding initiative, driven by a nonprofit community engagement group vying for foundation dollars, is a tactic to help the area get funded and survive. “If a neighborhood has an identity, it’s more fundable, I suppose.”

Under the oft-quoted Detroit Future City urban development plan used by Detroit’s mayor’s office, some neighborhoods are set to survive, and others are not. “They are choosing winners and they are choosing losers,” Cosme says. By branding itself in an identifiable way, “Springwells Village” is vouching for survival, but at what price?",a0f271c8-4feb-43ce-b1db-06ee329c46f6,News,2015-09-01T17:00:16Z,Guardian.co.uk,"Denali is a victory, but US communities are still rebranded to be 'white friendly'",0.0,News

2485,"No one is sure exactly how it happened. It may have been part of a plea bargain on charges related to the kidnapping of two early primary states. All we know is that Mr. American Voter agreed to go to anger management counseling, and the Democratic and Republican parties agreed to split the cost. 

“Mr. Voter,” the counselor began cautiously, “do you know why you’re here?” 

“Everybody’s got to be somewhere,” Mr. Voter snapped. 

“Your friends in the Republican and Democratic parties care about you,” the counselor said. “The party leaders think your anger has made your life unmanageable.” 
  
Mr. Voter’s answer was unprintable in a family newspaper. 

The counselor picked up a small notepad and a pen from a side table. “Tell me, Mr. Voter, when did you first experience a feeling of strong anger?” 

“September 11, 2001,” Mr. Voter said. “Things were going along all right. We had just had a long national debate over whether oral sex was adultery. It was football season, baseball playoffs were coming up. Things were all right. And then, somebody took a shot at us. Angry? I was volcanic. And I waited for the government to do something. Seemed like forever before they figured out what to do. 
  
“And what they did was a disaster. Fourteen years of war and it feels like the terrorists have won. Now we’re helping Iran sponsor terrorism and get a nuclear bomb. And when I go to the airport, they throw out my shampoo. 

“Angry? The government takes over the health insurance business and now it’s costing me more, and my doctor retired at 55 years old. 

“The financial markets crash in 2008 and what does the government do? Bail out everybody who caused it. Meanwhile I’m getting zero percent interest on my savings and it seems like the stock market is rigged with computer trading and inside information. 
  
“And everything’s more expensive. Food, energy, insurance, housing, college. And what does the government say? ‘There’s no inflation!’ 

“All the jobs that used to pay $60,000, $70,000 a year, so you could live, they’re gone or out of the country now. And what does the government say? ‘Job creation is strong!’ Over 90 million people have left the workforce. What does the government say? ‘They’re not unemployed!’ 

“And on top of everything, we’ve got an open border and millions of people who came into the country without legal authorization. What does the government say? ‘It’s all good!’ 
 
 
  
“I’m angry all down my left side and all down my right side,” Mr. Voter said. “I’m angry that CEOs are getting obscene payouts approved by corporate boards they recruited themselves. I’m angry that anybody who stands up for the interests of Americans is called a nativist or an isolationist or a wing nut. Where are you going?” 

“To get a bigger notepad,” the counselor said. 

“And another thing,” Mr. Voter raged. “I’m sick of hearing that American history is some kind of criminal record. I want Andrew Jackson on the 20. I want Alexander Hamilton on the 10. I want William McKinley on the mountain. I want George Washington taught in elementary school.” 
  
“I think that’s enough for our first day,” the counselor said. 

“Just give me the bill, we’re done,” Mr. Voter growled. 

“No, sir!” the counselor insisted. “The Democratic and Republican parties promised to pay for this.” 

Mr. Voter slammed his fist through the top of a coffee table. “You know they’ve run up $19 trillion in debts, right?” he yelled. “I’ll write you a check. My kids have enough bills to pay.”",316eac8d-d36a-42d4-a004-7961bfcbed00,News,2015-09-19T18:16:00Z,Inland Valley Daily Bulletin,American voter is mad -- and perfectly rational: Susan Shelley,0.0,News
1692,"The latest developments on the Volkswagen emissions scandal. All times local. 

--- 

9:45 p.m. 

Switzerland is banning sales of Volkswagen Group cars with outdated emissions systems in the wake of the emissions-rigging scandal that started in the United States. 

Thomas Rohrbach, spokesman for the Swiss federal office of roadways, says Friday that the ban is on all cars with diesel engines in the ""euro 5"" emissions category. It includes all VW models — as well as Seat, Skodas and others in the VW group. 

But the ban only affects cars not yet sold or registered, not ones already in circulation. It doesn't apply to cars now in production with ""euro 6"" engines, which aren't affected by the emissions scandal. 

Rohrbach said the ban potentially could affect 180,000 vehicles that have 1.2-liter, 1.6-liter and 2.0-liter diesel engines. 

--- 

9 p.m. 

Volkswagen says the 11 million vehicles worldwide that contain software involved in the emissions-rigging scandal include some 5 million cars made by its core Volkswagen brand. 

The Volkswagen Group includes 12 brands, and the company has yet to detail fully what cars where were involved. A Volkswagen statement Friday said some diesel models and model years — such as the sixth-generation Golf, seventh-generation Passat and first-generation Tiguan — are equipped exclusively with the EA 189 engines in which it says there are ""discrepancies."" 

It didn't detail where in the world the 5 million Volkswagens were sold. 

Volkswagen brand chief Herbert Diess says ""we are working at full speed on a technical solution that we will present to partners, to our customers and to the public as swiftly as possible."" 

--- 

7:20 p.m. 

Volkswagen says it is reorganizing its North America business under Winfried Vahland, until now chairman of the board of directors at Skoda. 

The company says Michael Horn will remain as president and CEO of Volkswagen Group of America, but its U.S, Canada and Mexico markets will be ""combined and significantly strengthened"" to form a new ""North America region."" 

--- 

6:50 p.m. 

Incoming Volkswagen CEO Matthias Mueller is pledging to do everything to win back the trust of the public in the wake of the emissions scandal that erupted in the U.S. 

He said after being appointed to the job on Friday that ""we stand by our responsibility."" He also said, however, that ""carefulness is even more important than speed."" 

Mueller said the company would introduce ""even tougher compliance rules"" and pledged to make VW ""an even stronger company."" 

--- 

6:40 p.m. 

Volkswagen AG has chosen the head of its Porsche division, Matthias Mueller, to succeed Martin Winterkorn as chief executive. 

Volkswagen's supervisory board appointed the 62-year-old Mueller, a longtime company insider, on Friday. 

Winterkorn resigned on Wednesday, taking responsibility for the car emissions scandal in the U.S. but saying he wasn't aware of any wrongdoing on his own part. 

--- 

3:50 p.m. 

Czech Transport Ministry says it is awaiting information from Volkswagen about how many of the EA 189 diesel engines at the center of the company's emissions-rigging scandal were used in Skoda Auto vehicles. 

Friday's announcement comes after Skoda Auto, a Czech carmaker owned by VW, acknowledged it used the engines in the past. 

It didn't give any further details except that they are not used anymore. 

It's not clear whether those Skoda cars cheated on any emissions tests. 

The ministry says it is in touch with counterparts in Germany and Britain, where Skoda cars received the necessary clearance for use in the European markets. 

--- 

3:40 p.m. 

The European Union wants quick answers as to how Volkswagen was able to use stealth software in its vehicles so they could pass lab tests on emission pollution standards. 

The top official responsible for the European single market, Elzbieta Bienkowska, said Friday that ""we need full disclosure and robust pollutant emissions tests in place."" 

Germany, Italy and France are among the countries known to be investigating, and the commission says their probes would include carmakers beyond VW. 

The EU plans to introduce new emissions tests next year involving on-road monitoring. They would complement the lab tests currently used. 

--- 

3:25 p.m. 

Germany's transport minister says 2.8 million vehicles in Germany were among those containing software at the center of the emissions-rigging scandal that started in the United States. 

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has accused VW of installing the so-called ""defeat device"" used to cheat emissions tests in 482,000 cars sold in the United States. 

VW later acknowledged that similar software exists in 11 million diesel vehicles worldwide, but hasn't given details of the models and their whereabouts. 

Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt told lawmakers Friday that 2.8 million of the vehicles were in Germany, news agency dpa reported.

Germany's transport minister says that light commercial vehicles at Volkswagen appear to be affected by the scandal over software used to cheat U.S. emissions test. 

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency accused VW a week ago of installing the so-called ""defeat device"" in 482,000 cars sold in the United States. VW later acknowledged that similar software exists in 11 million diesel vehicles worldwide. The German government has said that those included cars in Europe but it's not yet clear how many. 

German Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said Friday: ""According to our current information, light commercial vehicles as well as cars at Volkswagen are affected by the improper manipulation of diesel engine emissions."" He didn't give details.

Daimler AG, the maker of Mercedes cars, is rejecting claims by a German environmental group that it appears to have been involved in manipulation of emissions data. 

The Deutsche Umwelthilfe group said Friday that it had information that almost all German manufacturers of diesel cars — including Daimler — exceed emissions limits by such a level that it has to assume illegal devices to reduce nitrogen oxide readings are in play. 

Daimler on Friday issued a statement strongly denying any manipulation. It said that so-called defeat devices have never been used by the company, and that goes for all diesel and gas engines. It said that it sticks to all laws and rules, and it isn't aware of any measurements showing that its vehicles fail to keep to legal requirements.

Italy's transport minister says spot-checks will be done on at least 1,000 diesel vehicles of all brands following the Volkswagen emissions-rigging scandal. 

Graziano Delrio said on a late-night talk show that checks will be conducted at dealerships before sale. That will cost 8,000 euros per vehicle, meaning an overall tab of 8 million euros (nearly $9 million). Delrio, citing a ""problem of health, trust,"" said the truth must be established. 

An Italian consumer group, Altroconsumo, said Friday a class action suit was planned and called on Volkswagen to either correct the software employed in the emissions-rigging or substitute the vehicle. 

In Turin, Italy, Prosecutor Armando Spataro said prosecutors there will look into whether a criminal probe is warranted, clarifying earlier reports that investigators had ordered tests on Volkswagens in Italy.

12:20 p.m. 

Norwegian authorities have launched an investigation to find out whether the Volkswagen emissions-rigging scandal affects the Nordic country. 

Norway's economic crimes unit said Friday it will investigate whether ""there has been a criminal offense in Norway and whether the fraud has any significance for the cars in question that have been imported to the country."" 

The agency said it was working on the case jointly with the customs and transportation authorities.

Two US airlines will soon begin testing a new NASA-developed software that is designed to help air carriers save time, cut fuel consumption and carbon emissions. 
 
During the next three years, Virgin America and Alaska Airlines will use the Traffic Aware Planner (TAP) application to make ""traffic aware strategic aircrew requests"" (TASAR), the US space agency said in a statement. 
 
TAP connects directly to the aircraft avionics information hub on the aircraft. 
 
""It reads the current position and altitude of the aircraft, its flight route and other real-time information that defines the plane's current situation and active flight plan,"" explained David Wing, TASAR project lead at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. 
 
Then, it automatically looks for a variety of route and/or altitude changes that could save fuel or flight time and displays those solutions directly to the flight crew. 
 
TAP also scans the signals of nearby air traffic to avoid potential conflicts in any proposed flight path changes, making it easier for air traffic controllers to approve a pilot's route change request. 
 
For airlines with internet connectivity in the cockpit, TAP also can access information -- such as real-time weather conditions, wind forecast updates and restricted airspace status -- to further increase flight efficiency. 
 
The software is loaded onto a tablet computer, which many airline pilots already use for charts and flight calculations. 
 
Even four minutes of flight time shaved off of each leg of a trip made by an airline could result in massive fuel and time savings, according to researchers. 
 
The software provided similar results in flight tests. A second round of flight tests was recently completed to ensure readiness for operational use by partner airlines. 
 
""We are excited to partner with NASA to test this new technology that has the potential to help reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions and save our guests time in the air,"" commented Steve Forte, Virgin America's chief operating officer in Burlingame, California. 
 
Developers say the new technology will not require changes to the roles and responsibilities of pilots or air traffic controllers.",aed9f5a2-2a4d-4884-ad4e-7180662fae4a,News,2015-09-23T06:51:01Z,ProKerala.com,"NASA technology to help airlines save fuel, time",0.0,News

CALGARY - Calgary Stampeders linebacker Juwan Simpson has been sidelined four to six weeks with a broken clavicle. 

The CFL club made the announcement Monday via Twitter. 

Simpson has started at middle linebacker for the Stampeders every game since the 2012 season-opener. 

The three-time West Division all-star and Stampeder co-captain has 27 tackles and a pair of sacks in 12 games this season. Simpson has been a Stampeder for eight seasons and won Grey Cups with the team in 2008 and 2014. 

Calgary added defensive backs Brandon McDonald and Keith Lewis to the roster and placed cornerback Joe Burnett on the six-game injured list Monday. 

Burnett suffered an ankle injury on a punt return during Friday's 25-23 win over the Blue Bombers in Winnipeg. He was filling in for injured Tim Brown on return duties. 

McDonald was added to the active roster, while Lewis was placed on Calgary's practice roster. 

McDonald had 33 tackles, two interceptions and three knockdowns in eight games this season for the Ottawa Redblacks before his release Aug. 26. He appeared in a pair of games with the Stampeders in 2014 and totalled three tackles. 

The 30-year-old also played a combined 80 games in the NFL for Cleveland, Arizona, Detroit and Tampa Bay. 

Lewis, who played two seasons for Virginia University of Lynchburg, attended training camp of the New York Jets this season and Tampa Bay's in 2014. 

Calgary also released offensive lineman Nate Menkin from the practice roster.",5b8b552b-1ed9-4a3d-9d73-278ccb5c25c6,News,2015-09-28T21:29:55Z,IndulgeMagazine.ca,"Stampeders lose Simpson, Burnett to injuries",0.0,News

1046,"(NEW YORK) — An elderly man’s sweet serenade to his dying wife while in hospice care is warming the hearts of viewers across the globe. 
 
Erin Solari of New Orleans, videotaped her grandfather Howard Serena, 92, singing “You’ll Never Know” by Rosemary Clooney and Harry James to his wife Laura, 93, on Sept. 12. Laura currently suffers from dementia. 
 
“We knew that this was probably the last time, so we wanted to capture that moment,” Solari told ABC News on Monday. “It was really loving. 
 
“For me, right after the video, I was so overcome,” Solari added. “I broke down and started crying. I was so happy that I’d captured this moment for my family. It touched me, so it doesn’t surprise me that it touched other people as well.” 
 
The Gainesville, Florida, couple have nine children and 18 grandchildren. They’ve been married for 73 years. 
 
“This video is pretty awesome because she’s almost completely blind and he’s fairly deaf, so it’s difficult for them to communicate,” Solari said. “This kind of thing between them, singing to each other, wasn’t uncommon in our family. They were always singing and dancing and they’d be very vibrant in that way.” 
 
In the video, Howard strokes his wife’s face as he sings. Laura looks at her husband and mouths the lyrics. 
 
Solari’s heart-warming video was a hit on social media. 
 
“It [the video] was posted minutes after it happened on Facebook and it had over three million views,” she said. “I know it seems private, but my family is very proud and happy to share this love with the world. As for the feedback, all the love and support we’ve gotten, being around my grandmother, I believe it maybe it had a little bit of an impact of her feeling better. She’s been able to go home and we are very appreciative of that as well.” 
 
After being told the video had gone viral, Laura remarked: “I told you Howard that I’d make you famous.”

Bengals WR A.J. Green , who caught 10 passes for 227 yards and two touchdowns this past Sunday at Baltimore, today was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week by the NFL. 
 
Green's 227 yards constitute not only the most receiving yards in a game by any NFL player this season, but also the most yards from scrimmage. The 227 was his career high and the second-most receiving yards in Bengals history, behind Chad Johnson's 260 vs. San Diego in 2006. Green now holds the Nos. 2-3 game receiving yards totals in Bengals history. His previous high, 224 yards last season vs. Pittsburgh, stands third. 
 
Green's touchdowns last week were both in the fourth quarter. The first, an 80-yarder on which he ran the last 50 yards and eluded two tacklers, erased a 17-14 Bengals deficit. The second, a seven-yarder, erased another deficit and provided the game-winning points in 28-24 decision. 
 
Though he has been a Pro Bowl selection in each of his four full NFL seasons, Green had not previously won an Offensive Player of the Week award. He did win AFC Offensive Player of the Month award for September 2012. 
 
The last Bengal to win an AFC Player of the Week award was CB Dre Kirkpatrick , for a two-INT performance in Cincinnati's playoff-clinching win vs. Denver in Week 16 of last season. The last Bengal to win an AFC Offensive Player of the Week award was HB Jeremy Hill , who had 169 scrimmage yards and two rushing TDs in Week 15 of last season at Cleveland.

5354,"Greencrest Manor in Battle Creek Linda and I are just outside Battle Creek at Greencrest Manor for the wedding of Kim Cooke and Josh Thomas. This is such a beautiful bed-and-breakfast place (Grant Hill was married here). 
I woke up this morning and walked around taking photos. I also brought my copy of Thomas Merton's Thoughts in Solitude. I read it long ago, in 1988. I'm doing a slow-cook re-read. Merton is a discerner, a deep-dweller who lingers in life tasting and savoring it. 
Merton understood spiritual realities and their importance. He writes:
""There is no greater disaster in the spiritual life than to be immersed in unreality, for life is maintained and nourished in us by our vital relationship with realities outside and above us. When our life feeds on unreality, it must starve. It must therefore die."" (p. 17)
I see America as largely a nation of spiritually hungry, starving people who have mistaken material things for spiritual food. Acquisition of and investment in unrealities only leave people empty. We are the perpetually dissatisfied. 
For Merton the answer is to begin ""by renouncing the illusory reality which created things acquire when they are seen only in their relation to our own selfish interests."" (Ib.)
Tomorrow morning at Redeemer I'm preaching out of Revelation 11:15-19. Verse 15 reads:
15 The seventh angel sounded his trumpet,  and there were loud voices in heaven, which said: “The kingdom of the world has become     the kingdom of our Lord and of his Messiah,     and he will reign for ever and ever.” ""The heavenly voices shout out the turning point that the entire Bible has waited for - the arrival of the kingdom! Their song celebrates the reversal of the tragic earthly situation during the age of sin... Now that dichotomy [between the kingdom of earth and the kingdom of God] has ended, and the heavenly kingdom has replaced the earthly as the true reality."" (Grant Osborne, Revelation)  At this point the true nature of things will be clearly seen. Merton writes: ""The ""unreality"" of material things is only relative to the greater reality of spiritual things."" (Ib.) In other words, material things are created things; therefore their essence is discerned in and through their creators (either God, or persons). Think of the word 'inspiration' here; viz., 'spirit'... 'in'.  Reality is fundamentally spiritual. This morning my soul feeds on this, and I am nourished.",4b24dd7f-3fef-49ec-bfa7-ad27b520c25f,Blog,2015-09-05T15:40:10Z,John Piippo,Nourishment for the Hungry Soul,1.0,Blog

1341,"CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Part of the reason the Indians spent huge money for free agents Michael Bourn and Nick Swisher before the 2013 season was their extreme need for outfielders. They had Michael Brantley, and not much else. Two years later, Bourn and Swisher are gone. The outfield picture is not as bleak as it was at the end of 2012. We're talking about the likes of Aaron Cunningham, Johnny Damon and Shelly Duncan trying to plug the holes. The Tribe now has Brantley and two Maybes ... as in Abraham Almonte and Lonnie Chisenhall. It was a public relations yawner when the Tribe picked up Almonte last month in a deal with San Diego for Marc Rzepczynski. After Bourn and Swisher were traded to Atlanta for Chris Johnson, the Tribe needed a center fielder. Almonte was given a chance, partly because the Tribe was disappointed in Tyler Holt (2-of-20). Almonte got off to a hot start and has played fairly well. Heading into the weekend, Almonte is batting .276 (.864 OPS) with 4 HR and 16 RBI in 115 plate appearances. He has impressed the Indians with his play in center field, which has been a major upgrade over Bourn. It also has been better than scouting reports. Manager Terry Francona recently said that he can't recall Almonte missing a cutoff man. He also has shown the ability to bunt. He's a good baserunner. The Tribe loves Almonte's attitude. It was impressive how he homered in one at bat on Thursday, then had a bunt single after that. Almonte is 26. He batted .243 (.628 OPS) with 2 HR and 11 RBI in 152 plate appearances for San Diego last year. He signed at 16 and has spent parts of 10 years in the minors, where he's a career .267 hitter. The Indians aren't sure if he's their regular center fielder next season, but he's in the conversation. Can he be a late bloomer? The Royals Lorenzo Cain spent parts of nine years in the minors before sticking with Kansas City in 2012 -- at the age of 26. It wasn't until 2014 -- at the age of 28 -- that Cain really began to hit. Another Royals outfielder is Alex Gordon. He spent four years going up and down from the minors. He was a third baseman. It wasn't until he was 27 and moved to left field that he became a consistent hitter. Who knows if Almonte will become another Cain or Gordon, but it does appear that the Tribe has made another small trade that is paying off well for them. ABOUT LONNIE CHISENHALL Lonnie Chisenhall has played himself back into the prospect category, at least as a platoon option in right field. Last week, I wrote about his defense being a major asset. Chisenhall was sent to the minors in June after batting .209 in 45 games. He converted from third base to right field. He is batting .327 (.852 OPS) in 108 plate appearances since he returned. But there's a warning sign: The streaky Chisenhall is 2-of-24 in September. Chisenhall has been in the Majors for parts of every season since 2011. He has had at least 100 at bats in each of those seasons. But he has been unable to establish himself. He will be 27 on October 4. The Indians are watching to see if he can pull himself out of this September slump. But just as the Royals showed patience with Gordon -- also a first-round pick who switched from third to the outfield -- the Indians want to make sure they don't give up on Chisenhall too soon. ABOUT THE OUTFIELD PROSPECTS 1. The Tribe's 2014 first-round pick, Brad Zimmer, wore down at the end of his first pro season. He was 5-of-40 (.125) in his final 10 games. Zimmer batted .308 (.896) with 10 HR and 39 RBI for Class A Lynchburg. He started fast when promoted to Class AA Akron, but finished at .219 (.687) with 6 HR and 24 RBI for the Rubber Ducks. 2. Zimmer is only 22. He was put on the fast track because he was an accomplished college player. He does a good job in center field. He was 44-of-51 in stolen bases. Overall, Zimmer batted .273 with 16 HR and 63 RBI between Akron and Lynchburg. He is a very good prospect, but not Major League ready for early in 2016. 3. Tyler Naquin would have been in the Majors right now except for injuries. He suffered a concussion and a hip injury in the final two months of the season. The team's first-round pick in 2012, the 24-year-old Naquin batted .300 (.828 OPS) with 7 HR and 27 RBI between Class AAA Columbus and Akron. Like Zimmer, he is a center fielder. 4. Naquin batted .263 (.784 OPS) when moved up to Columbus for the final two months of 2015. That also was when he was hit by injuries. He probably should open 2016 with the Clippers. 5. Clint Frazier was the team's first-rounder in 2013. The 21-year-old finished strong at Class A Lynchburg, batting .325 after the All-Star break. Overall, he batted .285 (.842 OPS) with 16 HR and 72 RBI. 6. The Indians have been addressing the need for outfielders in the draft. Naquin (2012), Frazier (2013) and Zimmer (2014) are all first-round picks. ABOUT NEXT YEAR It's possible the Tribe could come back with Brantley in left field, Almonte in center and a platoon of Ryan Raburn and Chisenhall in right field. The Indians have a $3 million option on Raburn for 2016. He entered the weekend batting .293 (.919 OPS) with 7 HR and and 27 RBI. He is a part-time player, mostly effective against left-handed pitching. Raburn has had a strange career. In 2012, he batted .171 for Detroit. The Indians signed him to a minor league contract in 2013 and he batted .272 (.901 OPS) with 16 HR and 55 RBI. But in 2014, he hit .200 and had physical problems. This season, Raburn is productive. He is 34. Can he deliver another good year, or will he slump again? Chisenhall also has been very inconsistent. The prospects aren't ready, so the Indians do need to look to add an outfielder who can hit. KIPNIS TO THE OUTFIELD? Do you want to move an All-Star second baseman to the outfield? Yes, Jason Kipnis signed as an outfielder and was converted to second base. He probably can do a decent job in the outfield. But Kipnis is rated as the American League's No. 3 defensive second baseman by fangraphs.com. In case you are wondering, the respected website rates Francisco Lindor No. 4 among shortstops and Giovanny Urshela No. 5 at third base. The Indians now have very, very good infield defense. The case for switching Kipnis to the outfield is they need outfielders. Jose Ramirez is an above average second baseman defensively. Ramirez got off to an awful start (batting .176) and was sent back to the minors. Since he returned, Ramirez is hitting .243 (.726 OPS) with 3 HR and 10 RBI in 117 plate appearances. The case for Ramirez as a starter is that he's only 22. He is a career .304 hitter in five minor league seasons. And Ramirez may develop into a starter. I just hate doing anything different with Kipnis. He turned into a .300 hitter when put in the leadoff spot. He has worked so hard to become a good second baseman. He is 28. It's very hard to think of asking him to switch positions unless you have an All-Star caliber player ready to take over at second base. ABOUT THE TRIBE 1. Trevor Bauer was the key player in the Shin-Soo-Choo three-team trade after the 2012 season. But General Manager Chris Antonetti also had Bryan Shaw added to the package. In three years with the Tribe, Shaw has become one of the league's most durable relievers. His overall record is 15-11 with a 2.82 ERA. This season, he is 3-3 with a 2.52 ERA. He'll probably appear in at least 70 games for the third year in a row. 2. Writing about Abraham Almonte led to checking how Rzepczynski is pitching for the Padres. The lefty reliever has an 8.10 ERA. 3. The Hector Rondon who pitched for the Cubs against the Tribe recently is the same Hector Rondon who was one of the organization's prospects several years ago. But Rondon had elbow reconstruction surgery in 2010. He fractured the same right elbow in 2011. He barely pitched in 2012 as he was recovering. The Cubs picked him in the 2013 minor league draft. He has stayed healthy and in the last two years, he has 56 saves and a 2.20 ERA. 4. The bullpen door is wide open for Giovanni Soto to claim a spot. The lefty came to the Tribe in 2010 in a deal for Jhonny Peralta with the Tigers. Soto is 24 and has developed into a prospect when switching from the rotation to the bullpen. The Tribe's only other lefty reliever is Kyle Crockett. Lefty Nick Hagadone had elbow surgery in July. Rzepczynski was traded to San Diego. 5.

2364,"The new iPhones arrived in force and already a sales success story, showing that Apple returned to hit full on their formula for success. However, and beyond these figures, there have been some problems with these new equipment. The latest is associated with a bug in iOS 9 and allocating the motion sensors of the iPhone 6s. This problem is affecting only new iPhones 6S and was discovered by those who try to use applications that use the sensors of the new M9 motion co-processor. This happened to be now included in the SoC A9 processor from Apple and serves as the interface between the operating system and the different sensors that equip the iPhone 6S. The problem is reflected in the inability to use applications that make use of data from the various motion sensors, and in particular InvenSense gyro six axes and the accelerometer Bosch Sensortec three axes. When sensors that these are intended to be used fail to transpose the data and applications are left with strange behavior, making it impossible to use. The problem is, for now, contained the new iPhone models and appear to affect only third-party applications that try to use these sensors. Any of the Apple applications that make use of these sensors, such as maps, do not have these problems and also older iPhone models do not seem to be affected for the problem. The problem was first discovered in the application Sky Guide, which uses these sensors to display on the iPhone screen a map of the stars that adjusts according to the user’s movement. The team that developed this application addresses the problem to an implementation with failures iOS API 9th Gathering M9 coprocessor information. This team is also trying to find a solution to this problem, returning the possibility of using the Sky Guide in the new iPhones. But it’s not just this application that is experiencing this problem. Several programmers, responsible for other similar and that make use of the iPhone motion sensors applications are to complain of it. From what has been possible to ascertain, this is not an exclusive problem of the iOS 9 and even the latest version, 1.9, is showing the same behavior. It is also the first time that this problem arises in iPhones. Already in 2013, at the launch of iPhone 5s, there was a similar situation at the time was attributed to lack of calibration of the new accelerometer Bosch now being used. So far, and how is normal in these situations, Apple has not yet issued any comments or additional information about the problem. It is expected very soon news that should come in the form of an update to iOS and that should correct the problem.",3f9a848a-f602-437f-9d3d-594695490a3c,Blog,2015-09-29T07:49:29Z,Information Technology Current News,Failure iOS 9 commits motion sensors of the iPhone 6s – Pplware,1.0,Blog
2627,"BOCA RATON, Fla. , Sept. 17, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- New data from The 2015 Cancer Experience: A National Study of Patients and Caregivers reveals that overall satisfaction among cancer patients and caregivers with the care they received has improved significantly since the study was first fielded in 2012. The survey results also mirror the ongoing national health care debate and reveal significant gaps between patients' expectations and the quality of care they receive. While having access to advanced oncology therapies is important, survey respondents indicated that health care providers need to address their dissatisfaction with the lack of care coordination, confusion and frustration surrounding health care terminology (literacy), and the inability to obtain timely information from their care team. 

According to Gerard van Grinsven , President and CEO of Cancer Treatment Centers of America®, the company that sponsored the survey, it is critically important for health care leaders to understand and design care systems that enhance patient satisfaction. ""As leaders, we must integrate clinical excellence with service excellence to close any existing gaps that might negatively impact a patient's care experience,"" said van Grinsven . ""The ongoing insights from this annual survey should guide our thinking about how delivering outstanding clinical care and superior patient experiences converge to make a meaningful difference for cancer patients and their families."" 
   
Key findings from this year's survey include: 
Coordinated Care is The Key to Improving Overall Patient Satisfaction Sixty-two percent of cancer patients say that having a specific individual coordinate their care is important; however, only 32 percent experienced this type of coordination while undergoing treatment. Among patients who currently have coordinated care, the majority (74 percent) were ""completely satisfied,"" suggesting a direct correlation between the delivery of coordinated care and the overall patient experience. 
Lost in Translation : Patients and Caregivers Struggle to Understand Complex Health Care Terminology Less than half of patients (46 percent) and caregivers (49 percent) understand terms such as genomic testing, immunotherapy, precision cancer treatment and molecular testing. Even fewer know the benefits, suggesting there is a lack of clear and important communication between care teams, patients and caregivers. While the field continues to develop advanced therapies, patients and caregivers must come away with a clear understanding of the benefits and risks of specific treatment options in order to make informed decisions about their care. 
Lack of Confidence in Care Teams Causes Patients and Caregivers to Switch Providers Nearly 20 percent of caregivers switched their patient's health care provider because of a lack of confidence in his/her treatment plan and care team. This finding underscores the need to establish a coordinated and trusting relationship between the provider's care team and patients and caregivers, as well as the influence caregivers have on patients' selection of a treatment provider. 
The Next Generation of Patients is More Actively Involved and will ""Shop"" Providers Nearly 40 percent of cancer patients seek a second opinion, and these are typically younger patients. This finding suggests that younger cancer patients, in general, take a more proactive role in their treatment decisions. It also suggests there is considerable uncertainty about their initial diagnosis, including expectations about longevity, a lack of implicit confidence in the first opinion, and/or the fact that we are living in an age of far more enlightened consumers who are seeking more comprehensive information about their treatment options. 
""It is great news that the satisfaction of cancer patients is improving, but cancer care as a whole still needs to improve to make a bigger difference for patients, especially in ways that increase comfort, care coordination and access to essential information,"" said Maurie Markman , M.D., President of Medicine & Science at Cancer Treatment Centers of America®. ""Clinical excellence alone cannot replace the need to focus attention on patient comfort and coordinated care.""   

About The Cancer Experience: A National Study of Patients and Caregivers 
The Cancer Experience survey is a national online survey of 1,060 cancer patients and 1,051 caregivers who received treatment at hospitals across the United States , including at least 250 patients diagnosed at each stage of cancer no more than three years prior to their participation in the survey. This third annual edition of the survey and was conducted from April 14 through May 18, 2015 . It is intended to measure the comprehensive experience of cancer patients and caregivers, providing a barometer for the quality of the cancer care experience in the U.S. The survey measures gaps between patients' expectations about their care and the reality of the care they received.

26 September 2015 

Jason Plato: I think the balance is OK but we're just struggling with a little engine problem. We're not quite sure what is but the boys are going to pull it apart and have a look. 

Although Jason Plato was happy to salvage tenth during today's qualifying at Silverstone, the Team BMR driver was left to rue a small engine issue, which could potentially thwart the double British Touring Car champion's quest for a third title. 

The Volkswagen CC driver spent most of the 30 minute session mired in thick of the midfield runners but a last minute flyer pulled Plato back into the top-ten as his chief championship rival Gordon Shedden qualified onto the front row. 

To compound Plato's woes, the 93-time race winner said his best lap was then compromised when Rob Austin made a slight error in front but didn't hold it against the Audi driver. 

""Yeah a bit of a save,"" Plato told crash.net ""I lost a tenth on my best lap with Rob Austin, which wasn't his fault. He made a mistake going into Luffield and didn't realise I was on the inside so he then cut across and I had to back out of it. 

""What would a tenth do? Put me further up the road maybe but we've got an engine problem. The car at Rockingham wasn't quick in a straight line and it's not quick in a straight line here."" 

Plato says the issue is isolated to his side of the garage and admits he and his BMR squad are still yet to determine what the underlying cause for the loss of power is. 

""We've seen a big deviation between my speeds down the straights compared to Colin [Turkington] and Aron [Smith]. It's just on my side,"" Plato continued. 

""Also with the weight delta, Colin and I should be closer together while Aron should be up the road. I'm a further away from Colin down the straight, than he is to Aron. 

""We get to the straights and they keep accelerating but I start slowing up. That's not just weight, that's something else and we saw that at Rockingham. Normally, with no weight on, the VW's – apart from the Ford's – are the quickest in the straight line. At Rockingham with no weight I was mid grid.

If you would like to submit a story to this series, click here.  Today’s guest post is by Charity Craig. 
Only minutes after my mother-in-law arrived, there was a knock at the door. She returned, “there’s an officer here to serve you your divorce papers”. The words were the final nail in the coffin. It was over. My marriage was dead. There was nothing left for me to do, but let go, so I did. I began to sob and my mother-in-law just held me. Since I couldn’t pull myself together and the officer wanted to jet all the awkwardness, he served the papers to my mother-in-law. For the first time in my life, I fought for something, and I lost. Exhausted and depleted, I slipped the papers into my top drawer and took off my ring. I would deal with that tomorrow. I felt betrayed even by God. Didn’t he see how hard I had fought for the right thing? Now I had lost everything and didn’t see how he could ever turn something like this into good. I see and know what divorces do to families with children. In a brief moment, in my mind’s eye, it was like the shroud that hides my future was lifted and I could see down the tunnel of my life. An inaudible voice spoke to my heart, “Your good and perfect gift is eternal and I have it waiting for you, but until then you must walk this broken road”. Just like that, my dependence switched from Matt to Christ. Just like that, I gave up the fight to control. So, three days later when the shell of my husband showed up at the door and said he wanted to come back and give us a try, he met a different person. I was done fighting. It was over. He looked at me and said, “I’m sorry I never fought for us. I’m sorry I made you do it alone. You don’t need to fight anymore. I will”. The next several months he did fight, and we began to inch our ways back into the same room of life. I was determined not to put a Jesus Band-aid on the wounds, and Matt gave me permission to hurt. Standing across from Matt I lowered my shield and let him see my bleeding heart. Then, Matt lowered his shield and I was shocked to discover I wasn’t the only one in the room with a mortally wounded heart. Suddenly, “you need to pay for what you did” lost its punch. Over the next year, we’ve learned to take more risks with our own hearts, but be more tender with each other’s. We’ve practiced saying, “I forgive you” and “I love you” to each other and ourselves. This past weekend we celebrated our 10-year anniversary. We stayed in the nicest suite one night could buy here in town, and after enjoying free food and drinks in the concierge lounge we wandered down to the lobby lounge where Tom was singing classic songs. Matt gave a request and as Tom began to sing, Georgia on My Mind, Matt did the one thing he knew I’ve always longed to do; Matt pulled me up and danced with me while no one else danced. As Matt held me close, my heart was full. Tom finished his tune, thanked us for dancing, and then he said, “Let’s applaud this couple. That’s a couple in love”. Suddenly, everyone was applauding and looking at us. But what no one in that lounge realized, they were really applauding proof that there’s life after death.",98699d61-00cb-423f-8851-e83b348cc845,Blog,2015-09-23T13:00:00Z,Rage Against the Minivan,What I want you to know about reviving a dead marriage,1.0,News

During his incarceration in 1998, he began to write rap lyrics of his own 
that geared toward the street life and drug dealing & money. Known then as Lil Loc formed Tha Hav-Notz and joined a rap group from his 
neighborhood which combined local rap groups and solo acts forming C.O.D (City of DeLand). 
In 2000, Geechi Mouf (then Lil Loc) and Tha Hav-Notz signed to Full Moon Records, an independent record label owned by Brain “DJ FURY”Graham, a Southern bass legend”. However,the label folded 
the following year and The Hav-Notz were released from their contract. 
In 2003, Geechi Mouf and the group began working with Tra Thomas, a former NFL athlete, who funded their early rap careers and moved 
them to New York. 
 
After yielding little success, Geechi Mouf and Tha Hav-Notz decided to head back to Florida. Shortly after their move back to Florida, Geechi Mouf learned how to engineer his own music and began the DIY-method of building and structuring Hav-Not Muzic Group. 
In 2014, Geechi Mouf released his first mix tape under the HNMG recording label, entitled A Mouf Full which featured his first single “MJ KILLA”. 
His follow up debut “Cold Turkey” which tackled his controversial lifestyle as a drug dealer, was released in early 2015, and has since gained popularity across the southern regions of the United States.

The print component of “Sleep Sensitivity” is distributed within today’s 
      edition of USA Today in New York, Los Angeles, Washington 
      DC/Baltimore, with a circulation of approximately 250,000 copies and an 
      estimated readership of 750,000. The digital component is distributed 
      nationally through a vast social media strategy and across a network of 
      top news sites and partner outlets. To explore the digital version of 
      the campaign,  click

      consumer-targeted ad campaign for its biological series of products, and 
      has included a code (“SleepToday”) that grants 20% off their “Good Night 
      Bulb” when the code is entered on the Lighting

      Break,” Lighting Science is best known for their groundbreaking

      Lighting Science’s Good Night™ bulb removes 98 percent of 
      sleep-disrupting blue light waves. This patented technology supports 
      your body’s natural melatonin production, which helps you fall asleep 
      faster and stay asleep longer. To learn more about how light affects 
      your health, click

If you haven’t seen the trailer for Amy yet, go watch it now. The recent documentary from director Asif Kapadia is a haunting sketch of the life of Amy Winehouse that revives her music for new fans, and gives former fans the second dose of Winehouse they had all been waiting for. 
 
The film traces the artist’s rise and fall from her teenage beginnings as a jazz club frequenter, to her international fame with the Grammy Award-winning Back to Black , and finally to her tragic overdose at the age of 27. 
 
With footage from home videos, television and radio interviews, and heartbreaking post-mortem interviews with her closest friends and relatives, the film gives an explicit glance into the tragic and not so uncommon life of a high-profile celebrity. 
 
As a longtime Amy Winehouse fan, I was unsure of what to expect from the film. My interest in her was mostly confined to her music, and I knew little about her life aside from her public battle with addiction and her death five years ago. 
 
While her music has clear reference to her struggles with mental illness, broken relationships and drug use, a clear portrait of her experiences has never before been available to the public. This glimpse into her life gives a new meaning to her lyrics that makes her music even more powerful than it was to begin with. 
 
Amy Winehouse grew up in London, England, where she started her career as a jazz singer. She lived in a middle-class home with a set of friends that would stick around until her last days. Her story does not sound uncommon or tragic when first told, but as she aged, fell into depression, became reliant on drugs and alcohol, and lived a life exploited by the public, a great talent grew smaller. 
 
A powerful aspect of the movie is its ability to couple Winehouse’s experiences with the corresponding music she wrote in those moments. The film will go into detail about a part of her life, such as the on-again off-again relationship with her eventual husband Blake, and follow the scene with a live recording of the song reflecting this time in her life. The documentary does a beautiful job at highlighting lyrics with elegant script up against record studio footage and scribbled poetry in notebooks. 
 
One of the most tragic parts of the film comes when hearing from her parents. They both noticed her depressive behavior, but shrugged it off as a passing phase as opposed to addressing it. Her mother was made aware of her daughter’s lifelong struggle with Bulimia when she was a teenager, but didn’t see anything wrong with the behavior until much later in her life. Her father acknowledges that his absence from home and the affair that kept him away from his family led to her early substance abuse, yet he never made an effort to get her help until it was too late. 
 
Seeing how the people closest to her reacted to her struggles was devastating. It all made her death seem inevetable rather than preventable. 
 
It would have been nice to see more about her early musical influences rather than just elements of her personal life, but the film does touch upon her young love of jazz and its influence on her first recordings. 
 
Previous fans as well as those unfamiliar with her music and story can enjoy the film. It is a well-made documentary that does a lot with found footage and conveys a tragic yet compelling story that any music fan would appreciate.

Websites that achieved this rating have had the GoogleBot screen the Website detecting the following: if they contain software that is not common on mobile devices, the use of text that is readable without zooming, if links are far enough apart so that the correct one can be easily tapped and if content sizes to the screen so users don't have to scroll horizontally or zoom. 

Mr Justin Doyle, principal of Loan Easy said, ""We have worked hard to ensured we provided the very best website for visitors to it and to ensure it was Fully compliant with the Google's new mobile algorithm rolled out on 21st April this year.""

593,"WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court is blocking Samsung Electronics from selling some of its older smartphones in the U.S. in the latest twist to a long-running legal battle over how much of the devices' technology was copied from Apple's iPhone. 

The ruling issued Thursday by the U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington vindicates Apple, but might not hurt Samsung too much. That's because it applies to phones that are no longer popular. 

The most recent phone affected by the injunction, the Galaxy S3, was released in 2012 — long enough ago to be eclipsed by slicker smartphones in the rapidly evolving market for mobile technology. Samsung recently began selling the Galaxy S6, which was unaffected by Thursday's decision. 

Samsung could also revise the features covered by the injunction, something that the company has previously indicated it might do if prodded by the courts. 

Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. have been locked in a bitter feud for years over the patents covering a variety of features commonly used in many smartphones. 

The acrimony dates back to the reign of Apple's late CEO Steve Jobs, who contended that Google had ripped off the iPhone's innovations to use in Android, a free mobile operating system that Samsung uses in its smartphones. Samsung emerged as Apple's biggest rival in the smartphone market, making it the target of a legal onslaught that has continued long after Jobs' death nearly four years ago. 

Juries in two separate federal court trials in San Jose, California, decided some of the features in Samsung's phones and tablets infringed on Apple's patents covering iPhone innovations. Apple has been awarded more than $600 million in damages so far, but Samsung is still pursuing appeals that could reduce the amount owed. 

In a 2-1 vote, the appeals court issuing Thursday's injunction concluded Apple was being harmed by Samsung's infringement on patents for iPhone's slide-to-lock screen and auto-correct feature. The court also concluded that protecting Apple's intellectual rights wouldn't harm the public welfare. 

""Apple does not seek to enjoin the sale of lifesaving drugs, but to prevent Samsung from profiting from the unauthorized use of infringing features in its cellphones and tablets,"" wrote U.S. Federal Circuit Judge Kimberly Moore in the majority opinion.",42acf682-6bd9-4c47-a994-a4c1cfa4e61a,News,2015-09-17T21:49:05Z,Boston Herald,Court blocks US sales of old Samsung phones in Apple battle,0.0,News

3345,"MythBusters co-host Adam Savage has revealed his own take on the viral “Duck Army,” naming it a “Duck Bomb.” 
 
For those who have yet to experience the Duck Army, the concept stems from a video created and unleashed online by Norwegian mechanic Kevin Synnes. As the Huffington Post reports, Synnes demonstrated that when you gather a bunch of rubber duck toys , squeeze the air out of them, and unleash the flock, you can create a powerfully unsettling cacophony. The Duck Army video was later made into a Vine by Charlie Murphy of Ireland, which went viral in a powerful way, having racked up over 644,000 likes since it was first shared. 
  
Enter MythBuster Adam Savage, who decided to engage in a little freelance myth-busting outside of the confines of his show. In a blog post published at Tested on Sunday, Savage acknowledged that he had his own reservations regarding the reality of the Duck Army video. 
 
I felt a great disturbance in #TheForce , as if millions of voices cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. https://t.co/IBUkDRS16G 
 
— Adam Savage (@donttrythis) September 9, 2015  
 
“It’s possible by now you’ve seen my rubber-duck screaming video, but I want to give credit where credit is due. Like many, I had my doubts as to the Duck Army video’s veracity: I couldn’t imagine that all the duck noisemakers could be set to such varying tones, making it sound like a visit to Dante’s Hell. Or something out of a Bruegel painting.” 
  
And now I present to you… the DUCK BOMB. #duckarmy  https://t.co/4oOMXgvfVN

Built a little something for my #duckarmy . Ready for the video? pic.twitter.com/7j2gRDt6ng 
 
— Adam Savage (@donttrythis) September 14, 2015  
 
Savage proceeded to order 12 duck dog toys and construct his Duck Bomb, which consists of a plywood box that holds 10 of the toys compacted together. Removing the safety sets off Savage’s Duck Bomb, allowing the toys to inflate and begin wailing with a collective moan reminiscent of the damned, which confirms the validity of the original Duck Army video. According to the MythBusters host, the actual sound of the screaming duck toys is “even more amazing in person than you can imagine.” 
 
Though Savage refers to his Duck Bomb as “the ultimate secret weapon,” he managed to share the video with his 1.25 million Twitter followers on Monday. According to Laughing Squid , the rubber ducks responsible for the viral phenomenon are actually Kyjen Squawkie Talkie rubber pelicans. While Synnes admits that the original video was meant to simply embarrass his girlfriend, the Duck Army has taken on a life of its own, now going one step further with Adam Savage’s Duck Bomb.

I'm of course talking about the World Cup of Brands.

They pay millions so they don't have to get dirty in the scrum - they pay millions to have their name associated with the tournament by default. Heineken in particular are reported to have invested nearly half of its master brands budget this year solely on their sponsorship deal.

2726,"Jonathan Weyer is the author of the upcoming novel, The Faithful, due to be released in the Fall of 2010 by Brio Books. He has also written a book about his ministry to atheists tentatively titled, Confessions of a Pirate Chaplain. This book is currently being shopped by his agent, Wes Yoder. Jonathan was born in 1974 in Huntingburg, Indiana. He spent two weeks every summer with his grandma who allowed him to check out stories about Bigfoot, the Mothman and ghost stories from the library. This summer reading gave him a lifelong love for scary stories. Jonathan's family moved to St. Louis, Missouri when he was in the sixth grade. After college, he went to Covenant seminary and graduated with a Masters of Divinity with honors. He is currently ordained in the Evangelical Presbyterian Church. While pastoring two churches, one in Illinois and one in Florida, he began to write a fantasy book based on American mythology. After a move to Columbus, Ohio, Jonathan felt a call to campus ministry at The Ohio State University. During the transition from church ministry to campus ministry, he decided to write his second novel, The Faithful, which combined his knowledge of the church and his love for scary stories. Jonathan is the founder of The Thomas Society, a ministry dedicated to answering questions from doubters, agnostics and atheists. Along with the atheists at Ohio State, he won a Multicultural Award from the university. Because of his work with atheists, the Secular Student Alliance added him to their speaker's bureau. - www.jonathanweyer.com",8dc7dd37-dfce-4081-98be-94db7544030d,Blog,2015-09-21T02:27:43Z,The 'X' Zone Radio Show,JONATHAN WEYER,1.0,News
4841,"Pope Francis will be arriving in the U.S. today, Tuesday. He has a crowded schedule ahead of him this week, with stops in Washington, D.C., New York, and Philadelphia. Among his other events, on Thursday he will be addressing a joint session of Congress--the first religious leader to do so.
 
 I sincerely hope the pope's trip goes well. His visit means a lot to millions of my fellow Americans. Although I do not share their religious beliefs, I can understand their enthusiasm and I respect their right to practice their religion, including holding mass events to celebrate the presence of the leader of their church.
 
 Sure, getting around the D.C. area, which is where I live and work, will be a nightmare, but given the traffic congestion we normally have, as well as our dysfunctional subway system, the difference in the level of gridlock will be a difference in degree rather than a difference in kind. We'll survive.
 
 And, as surveys confirm, even those of us who are not Catholic seem to like Pope Francis. He doesn't appear to be as much of a scold as Pope Benedict or John Paul II. Moreover, although he has not undertaken anything resembling a radical reform of the Church's antiquated, rigid doctrines or its ossified structure, he does seem to be a more compassionate figure, as indicated, for example, by his taking steps to make the Catholic Church more welcoming to gays and lesbians.
 
 That said, there is one aspect of his visit which bothers me, namely, the aforementioned address to a joint session of Congress. This sets an unfortunate and dangerous precedent. A religious leader has no business addressing the legislature of a secular nation.
 
 Please don't try to diminish the significance of this precedent by saying that Pope Francis is just another head of state. Everyone knows that the sovereignty of Vatican City is a legal fiction. Like many legal fictions it has served a useful purpose. Its creation in 1929 resolved a long-running dispute between the Catholic Church and Italy. (Indeed, it may be one of the few good, creative ideas that Mussolini had.) But the pope is not here because he is the theocratic ruler of 100 acres, nor was he invited to speak before Congress because of the tremendous power that Vatican City has as a nation. Pope Francis is here on a visit to the faithful of his church, and he was invited to speak before Congress because he is a spiritual leader of over 1 billion people, including about 70 million Americans.
 
 A bedrock principle of our secular democracy is that the government has no business interfering in religious matters, and it certainly has no right to show preferential treatment to a religious leader simply because many more Americans belong to his religious body. The truth of religious claims is not resolved by a popular vote. If we invite Pope Francis, the alleged Vicar of Christ, to address Congress, why not Thomas Monson, the Prophet who leads the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints? 
 
 Furthermore, on what authority is Pope Francis going to predicate his address to Congress? When leaders of foreign states (real, not fictional states) address Congress, they provide the perspective of their country on matters of interest to the Congress of the United States. Pope Francis is going to present the perspective of -- who? God?
 
 Just as it is a cornerstone of our democracy that the government does not interfere with religious matters, likewise it is a fundamental principle of our democracy that religious doctrine should play no role in shaping government policy. The religious views of Pope Francis, whether laudable or lamentable, have no relevance to the policies and legislation of a secular state. At some point, you can bet Pope Francis is going to reference his understanding of God's word and the implications this has for our policies. But he has no standing to tell Congress or us what we should do based on his religious beliefs.
 
 Congress should never have invited Pope Francis to speak, and, to show respect for our secular democracy, he should have declined the invitation.

4063,"Port of Mombasa. If all systems work as intended to, goods will be cleared faster. PHOTO | FILE  
 
International trade has grown rapidly in recent years, thanks to the progressive reduction of tariffs and quotas through multilateral trade liberalisation. 
 
More trade means more goods crossing borders and having to comply with Customs formalities. 
 
Businesses suffer both direct border-related costs, such as expenses related to supplying information and documents to the relevant authority, and indirect costs, such as those arising from procedural delays, lost business opportunities and lack of predictability in the regulations. 
 
Surveys aimed at calculating these costs suggest that they may range from 2 per cent to 15 per cent of the value of traded goods in developed countries and upto between 30 per cent and 42 per cent in production costs in developing countries. 
 
Inefficient border procedures cost governments in terms of lost revenue, smuggling and difficulties in implementing trade policy, for instance because of difficulties in determining the origin of products or in collecting accurate statistics. 
 
With increasing integration of economies around the world, facilitating the smooth flow of trade becomes a pressing requirement for governments and businesses. 
 
Efficient information systems and procedures can significantly reduce the time taken to move goods, reduce costs and improve business. 
 
In Kenya, trade facilitation is carried out by a number of institutions. The roles of the trade facilitating agencies range from revenue collection, provision of services for cargo movement and ensuring that goods conform to the set standards and health regulations, efficiency and enhance the overall economic performance of a country. 
 
The overall objective of the Kenya Electronic Single Window System Project also known as Kenya TradeNet System is to facilitate international trade in Kenya by reducing delays and lowering costs associated with clearance of goods at the border, while maintaining the requisite controls and collection of levies, fees, duties and taxes on imports or exports. 
 
Despite recent reforms, trade related procedures remain lengthy and costly; an aspect which has negatively impacted on the competitiveness of Kenyan goods in the region. 
 
The rationale for implementing the Single Window System results from the following weaknesses inherent in the current system: 
Besides having upto 27 agencies, duplication has become the order of the day, for example between Kenya Bureau of Standards and National Transport Safety Authority on vehicle inspections, Pharmacy & Poisons Board and Nursing Council of Kenya, National Bio safety Authority and Radiation Protection Board. Again the motivation does seem to be elsewhere – revenue generation. 
 
Essentially, everyone stands to gain from making the process of trade easier. Governments gain because efficient border procedures enable them to process more goods and improve control of fraud, thus increasing government revenue. 
 
Businesses gain because, if they can deliver goods more quickly to their customers, they are more competitive. And consumers gain because they are not paying the costs for lengthy border delays. 
 
The benefits of single window clearance of cross-border cargo to an economy are numerous. The World Bank says that economies that have adopted single window systems for transparent, efficient and faster cargo clearance are better than those without. 
 
The Bank’s 2014 Logistics Performance Index ranking places Kenya at number 74 while Egypt and South Africa are at 62 and 34 respectively.",6ca6c519-d2de-4ffd-9723-b0c6eda823de,News,2015-09-05T14:21:15Z,East African,Single Window System alone will not deliver,0.0,News

Posted by SINGAPORE: A bullish target at $1,686 per tonne has been temporarily aborted for LME aluminium, due to a false break above the resistance at $1,617. 

The resistance is provided by the 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement on the fall from the May 6 high of $1,977 to the Aug. 24 low of $1,506. Only a rise to $1,638 could confirm a valid break, and the target at $1,686, the 38.2 percent will then be resumed. 

Most likely, the metal will drop to $1,575, the 14.6 percent retracement, as it has not pulled back towards a trendline falling from $1,977. 

The next resistance will be at $1,686, the 38.2 percent level.

1583,"Danny Dyer says 'Coronation Street's live episode is ''f**k all'' compared to 'EastEnders' live week. 
The 38-year-old actor - who plays Queen Vic landlord Mick Carter in the BBC One soap - has admitted he ''can't wait to tune in'' to his ITV rivals' upcoming live episode but insisted it should be a piece of cake for the actors as he and his co-stars managed an entire week of live action. 

He said: ''I know what it's like - it's tough! 

''You've got to remember that we did a week ... So one night is f**k all really! But I'm rooting for them.'' 

Danny also revealed that although his on-screen wife Kellie Bright (Linda Carter) will be busy training for 'Strictly Come Dancing' over the next few months, there will still be plenty of big storylines for the Carter family. 

The 'Football Factory' actor told OK! Online: ''Where do I start? We've got loads coming up. 

''New Year's Day is proper! It's all about the Carters.'' 

Danny's comments come after 'EastEnders' executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins warned Kellie she could be ''broken'' by her jam-packed schedule. 

He told The Sun newspaper: ''I have lots of material planned for Kellie. Linda's not going to disappear because you can't have the Queen Vic without Linda. 

''We gave Kellie a couple of weeks off at the beginning so that she can throw herself into it ['Strictly']. But there's a point later in the run when she's going to be really busy.

1981,"The junta-stacked legislature prolongs the junta's rule after the draft constitution was widely criticised. 

Bangkok: Thailand's military has prolonged its direct rule of the country after a junta-stacked legislature voted to reject a new constitution.

The National Reform Council's rejection of Thailand's 20th constitution, by 134 votes to 105, will push back any prospect for elections and a return to civilian rule while the military maintains its firm grip over the country's often turbulent politics.

The military toppled Thailand's democratically-elected government to seize power in May last year.

Military members on the council backed away from endorsing the constitution in response to criticism of it by almost all of Thailand's political parties.

The new charter would have significantly weakened the parties, using a system where it would have been much harder for any one party to win an overall majority, forcing the formation of multi-party coalitions.

But analysts said no matter what the vote, the military would benefit.

If the charter had passed it would have enshrined a military-dominated 23-member politburo-style committee to co-exist alongside parliament that would have had the power for five years to take over at any time in what it deemed a crisis situation.

Borwornsak Uwanno, chairman of the drafting committee, said the proposed body - called the National Strategic Reform and Reconciliation Committee - would be a ""special tool"" to ensure a smooth transition to democracy and prevent future coups.

The ""no"" vote means the process of drafting another constitution will start again, delaying any election until 2017 at the earliest.

The Pheu Thai party, which was ousted from power last year, described the constitution as ""totally disregarding the sovereignty of the Thai people"".

Pheu Thai's rivals in the pro-military Democrat Party called for it to be rejected pending further discussion.

What ordinary Thais thought about it is unknown, because the military did not allow it to be debated.

A small group of protesters who defied orders not to protest were arrested on Sunday.

Thailand is currently using an interim constitution drafted by the junta last year. It gives sweeping unchecked powers to the junta led by former army commander Prayuth Chan-ocha.

Thailand has had on average a new constitution every four years since the end of the absolute monarchy in 1932.

The vote came at a time of unease in the county over the health of 87-year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej, a faltering economy and an unprecedented bombing in central Bangkok on August 17 that killed 20 people and injured 120 others.

3262,"What Is 'Public' Education? - Bridging Differences - Education Week: What Is 'Public' Education? 
Dear Harry and friends,
It's good to get back to a schedule with deadlines.  After a lifetime of deadlines this retirement life is sometimes harder to enjoy than it ought to be. 
Harry Boyte is a very old friend, although not as old as I am.  We've always been sort of on the same page but coming to it from different dispositions, life experiences and ways of seeing the world.   As a result I often turn to him when I'm perplexed and worried for the possibility that he can come up with a way of looking at the issues that gives me a new thread to pull at.
Our basic commitment to democracy has posed problems for us both, as you will discover.  We've ""played"" with it in different venues and settings, with occasional shared ones.  That helps.   Harry has managed to make life even more difficult for himself (and helpful to me) by having a longstanding and personal commitment to the saga of South Africa.
But we're going to tackle the complexity of the idea itself--as a way of living as well as a way of governing, and in the process we hope to help our friends and allies reexamine their positions around public schooling so that, at the very least, we are all on something closer to the same side than we often are now.  How can we define public in a democracy in such a way that it helps us separate the efforts to privatize education and the efforts to figure out how to more successfully provide an education for democracy for all of us? 
Lucky are those who can go to a free public school, close to home, where they can feel confident that their child is in good hands, with people you can trust, and with people who will take your concerns seriously and respectfully.   How to give professionals the respect and autonomy they want while you, their family, doesn't have any reason to fear that their autonomy will be used against their children's and their own best interests?  While also...still another hitch--expecting the larger public to pay the bill.  
Even families who have the means and desire to pay for  private school make compromises--but they have choices when and if the compromises become intolerable.  What about the rest of us?  Is choice an answer?  Or does it simply lead to pretending that an unequal market place is equally good for rich ad poor, white and black, atheists and the devoutly religious?   Of course, Harry, we may not end up covering all this, since as we go along we may discover many interesting bypaths--like when is representative democracy best vs direct?  Who should be ""included""--the custodian, the cook?  Which tax payers?    And on and on.....
Dear Deb and colleagues,
I have always greatly appreciated your passion for democracy as the most important end of education, as well as your  deep respect for teachers' roles, and your view of education as a living, relational, consequential activity that should ""liberate the powers"" of each student, in Dewey's phrase.
We also have differences on what is ""public"" education and what erodes it. My story helps to explain.
I was shaped as a young white southerner in the 1960s by my family's involvement in the ""civil rights"" movement. I also agree with Martin Luther King's friend Vincent Harding, who said in Hope and History, ""civil rights movement is too narrow a description...in fact [the movement] was a What Is 'Public' Education? - Bridging Differences - Education Week:",518c2cb5-bdb4-4021-b873-3cad6965c022,Blog,2015-09-22T15:10:16Z,Big Education Ape,What Is 'Public' Education? - Bridging Differences - Education Week,1.0,News

That alone speaks volumes about the community. 

• Andrea Eliscu , mentor and philanthropist. When Eliscu lost her husband to cancer 15 years ago, she had every reason to retreat from the world. Instead, she embraced it: helping underprivileged kids, women with cancer, aspiring medical students and more. Eliscu's most creative endeavor is probably her dragon-boat project, in which kids from Parramore team up with Orlando cops in rowing competitions, learning to row and work together. That effort alone was profiled recently on NBC's ""Today"" show. But she has also helped cancer survivors and helped fund a scholarship for the inaugural class of UCF med-school students … in her husband's honor. 
 
• David Odahowski and the Edyth Bush Charitable Foundation. It's hard to overstate the impact this foundation has on our community. We are talking donations of more than $100 million to more than 800 organizations — bolstering art and culture, promoting education, helping the destitute and more. The CEO, Odahowski, and his foundation do much of their work quietly but with widespread, impressive results. 

• Judy Sarullo of Pet Rescue by Judy. A lot of people have a passion for animals. Few turn that passion into a lifetime pursuit. More than 20 years ago, Judy started her crusade to find homes for unwanted animals in Seminole County. Since then, she has helped place pets all over Central Florida — a whopping 60,000 of them — which is why the Sentinel once described Judy as ""patron saint of abandoned, abused and unwanted dogs and cats."" 
  
• Virtually every public defender. They are overworked, outmanned and underpaid. They are scoffed at by some of their rotten clients. They don't get the time they need to work on cases that truly need it, and yet they can be someone's only hope for justice. Their profession is both noble and inglorious. Frontline prosecutors are in similar boats. The balance of justice often rests with people who aren't making enough money to pay off their law-school loans. 

• The Rev. Bill Barnes . Barnes retired this year as senior pastor of St. Luke's United Methodist Church But he leaves behind a legacy that has both changed — and saved — lives. Barnes believed that no one should suffer because of a lack of health care. That belief led him to found Shepherd's Hope Ministries, which now provides 21,000 free patient visits each year in clinics throughout Orange and Seminole counties. The reins here have recently been taken over by CEO Marni Stahlman , who will carry on the legacy — which includes an impressive 1,800 volunteers. 
 
• Michelle Mangum , director of Seminole Work Opportunity Program for special-needs adults. Michelle's offices are anything but glamorous. They're housed in an old warehouse with a crumbling second floor in a remote part of Seminole County. But there, she presides over a haven and refuge. At SWOP, developmentally disabled adults get a chance to have a job and earn dignity — at the only facility of its kind in Central Florida. Mangum could make more money elsewhere, but it's hard to imagine she could make more of a difference. 

• Joy Wallace Dickinson . Yes, the Sentinel's Joy Wallace Dickinson. Loudmouth columnists such as I may generate more mail. But week in and week out, Joy provides a service like no one else in Central Florida: sharing the stories of Central Florida's history in her weekend ""Florida Flashback"" column. History is important in any community. But history- tellers are particularly important in a transient community such as ours. Joy continues to fill that role even after retiring from her full-time days here … and we should all be grateful for that. 

• Bob Kodzis , professional inspirer. I first profiled Bob, a leadership and team-building consultant, a few years back when he began his new life-work model of donating half of all his services to local charities. (The title of the piece: ""He works one volunteer job for every paying one — and is richer for it."") Well, it's been three years. And Bob's ""buy one, give one"" lifestyle is still going strong, benefiting nonprofits throughout the region. 

• Lizette Valarino , fulfiller of college dreams. Many students can get accepted to college if they work hard enough. Not everyone can afford to go, though. That was the problem Valarino wanted to solve when she founded the Hispanic Heritage Scholarship Fund. Since she did so in 2000, the fund has provided scholarships to more than 200 students in Central Florida, transforming a whole lot of lives. 

• Donna Dowless , ""Ambassador of Love"" for the city of Orlando. Sure, the title — bestowed upon her by Mayor Buddy Dyer — may sound silly … until you meet Dowless and realize how genuine she is about promoting the upside of the City Beautiful. Dowless is a downtown artist with hip glasses and a cool coif who promotes and embraces all things Orlando and artistic. She's everywhere and all positive, all the time. There's a reason most of her artwork involves hearts. 

I have many more winning names to take — including Dr. Marvin Hardy , singer Mr. Richard , the leadership of Orange County's Legal Aid Society and more.

876,"Let me introduce you to my life savior ! 
 
Like most of you, social media is now undeniably part of my life – rather than just an addition to my life. As there’s more and more social media app coming out, the amount of data consumed also increase tremendously. Hence, a good internet data plan is crucially important. 
 
I will need a 7GB data per month! & there’s where Postpaid P70 Hero plan came into my rescue. 
The HERO P70 Postpaid plan does look really good. Let’s see! 
Every day, I would spend hours on my …. 
 
#1 Instagram 
 
Uploading images from my phone. & refreshing my feed over and over again. 
 
If you realize, Instagram has also introduced auto-playing video, which is a feature that can really consume a fair amount of your data plan if left unchecked, especially if you are following a lot of people who post video on Instagram. T.T 
 
 
#2 Facebook 
 
It’s literally my newspaper. I will definitely scroll through my whole feed to get myself updated on what’s happening around the world every single day, which has quietly suck up a lot of my data. (p.s. – facebook now preloading all videos =.=) 
 
 
#3 Snapchat 
 
How snapchat drained up your data? 
1GB of data is only sufficient for about 1000 views of “My Story”. 
 
I started by viewing my idol’s snap, it’s like watching them in real life. Following them to places they dine, they travel to, etc. (& that is already about 300 views per day. Lol.) 
 
Then I started snapping too. Unlike Instagram, you don’t need to select the correct filter to make your feed looks good, it’s so convenient and real. Video definitely tells better story than a photo, especially when you travel! 
 
I thought RM38/day roaming is cheap until I discover U Mobile P70 Hero , I get 50MB of free internet roaming every day on my travels, & daily roaming charges go as low as RM30/day. Probably the cheapest I’ve seen so far. 
 
 
#4 Blog – WordPress. 
 
I normally spend 4-5 hours to complete one blog post. & ever since I started working, I can no longer afford to spend the amount of time sitting in a café to finish up one blog post. Therefore, I got to squeeze time out to blog during lunch break, or during any free time I have. 
 
With that, I will need a lot of data to upload all the images to my WordPress. 
& to save time, I certainly need U Mobile P70 Hero’s high speed internet! 
 
 
#5 Dayre 
 
Bit size blogging. 
 
I would love to blog about E V E R Y T H I N G, genuinely. But like many of us, I started to cut down blogging bit by bit, judging whether this and that is blog worthy. ): 
 
Thank God for Dayre, I found a place to fulfil my passion for story telling! 
But there’s a price to pay – it’s going to be a big hit against the data plan! 
 
 
#6 17 
 
The new hype, one of the most popular video chat app now! 
A real-time wireless video chat. 
 
As you chat, & as you receive the love from your audience; 
you will also be receiving a massive internet bill too! Haha. 
 
Lucky me, I can now live stream with peace of mind with U Mobile P70 Hero. 
 
 
#7 Shopee 
 
My webstore. 
Not just eating up my data as I upload new products, I also spent a lot of money calling my buyers. 
 
I definitely need a plan that gives unlimited FREE calls & FREE SMS to all networks! 
& that’s how U Mobile P70 Hero does it wonders. 
 
 
“According to Cisco’s online VNI Services Gauge Tool, one hour of browsing through social media can use up 90 megabytes, which is more than twice the amount of data that streaming music uses in the standard “normal” quality per hour.” 
 
As much as we know how much data these social media app is using, we couldn’t live without it. Like I said, it’s already part of us! 
 
Therefore social media addicts like us, often face the frustration of insufficient data, and the need to top up our internet quota so frequently. It’s unavoidable. 
 
 
But, all frustrations and problems solved when I ported over to U Mobile P70 Hero. 
 
This 7GB data is sufficient for me to freely use all the above mentioned social media apps. & it’s only RM70 per month, what a steal! Definitely the most valuable plan I had! 
 
Let’s conclude, by paying RM70/month, I now enjoy: 
– Unlimited FREE calls to all networks 
– 7GB High speed internet quota 
– NO contract (no longer get lock down to a 2yrs contract) 
– Free 50MB internet roaming, daily roaming charges of as low as RM30/day 
 
 
Well, if you don’t think you are able to finish up all the 7GB of date, you can actually share your internet quota with up to 2 others SIMs. Now this is interesting!

3845,"While searching for banded gulls on southern Lake Michigan on Sunday, 20 September 2015, I spotted this adult Herring Gull with a silver band on its right leg:
Banded Herring pictured next to a 2nd cycle Lesser Black-backed Gull.
Berrien County, Michigan. 20 September 2015. As I started moving about and recording the numbers on the band, the bird sensed my presence and walked off to the shoreline:
When gulls move to the water's edge like this, it usually means they're nervous and are ready to fly off. So I backed off, giving it a few minutes to relax and take to me, all the while without making any eye contact. As it started to loosen up I went back to photographing:
I reported the following sequence to the Bird Banding Lab that night: 0846-10957.
Data Submission All the Herrings that I've submitted to the Bird Banding Lab (BBL) in the past have been between 1-12 years old. So you can imagine my surprise when the following banding date came back: 28 June 1986. 29 YEARS AND 3 MONTHS OLD!!
Coincidentally, I had two other banded birds on this day and reported them too. The next morning I received Certificates of Appreciation for these two gulls, but not the 29-year old. It was flagged due to its old age. The BBL asked for more details as to how I retrieved the band number and requested photos from me. This is standard protocol for older birds. But not just ""any old"" bird. Little did I know that my report was going to set a new Herring Gull longevity record in North America.
I submitted the entire set of photos showing the numbers and this is the reply I received:
""Hi Amar, Excellent photos, thank you for sending them.  This confirms 0846-10957, 29 years 3 months old, and the new longevity record for the species.  It's a good thing the bander used a hard metal band!  You'll have to keep an eye out for this bird in the future.  This record will get posted to our longevity website, which I'm coincidentally working on updating this week so it should show up soon. This is actually the first time this bird has been reported to us.  Banded as a ""local"" or still dependent bird on 6/28/1986 in the 10 minute block designated as Egg Harbor, WI.  The permit is still active that banded it, St. Mary's University of MN, Dr. Raymond Faber.""
Jo Anna Lutmerding Supervisory Biologist / Encounter Data Manager Bird Banding Laboratory Patuxent Wildlife Research Center 12100 Beech Forest Rd Laurel, MD 20708 301-497-5940 jlutmerding@usgs.gov The bander, Dr. Raymond Faber, who I've spoken with on several occasions regarding his banding work, sent me this reply as well:
""Amar, this is fantastic news!  A new record for longevity in North America!  I banded the bird on Hat Island (which is nearest to Egg Harbor) on June 28, 1986 as you reported.  Wow!  Keep looking for it. Thanks so much for your tireless devotion to the gulls.""
Ray Faber
And so there you have it. A simple field observation has added a tiny bit of enrichment to our knowledge of Herring Gulls in North America. I'm confident that there are older Herrings on this continent - and surely in Europe - we just have to get out there and spot them! I'm looking forward to relocating this bird...maybe on its 30th birthday?
Below is a list of the 4 oldest American Herrings in the BBL database, with my bird now being the oldest. What makes this individual even more special is that it was alive and well (whereas the others were found dead).

1122,"Texas Tech had the ball for 20 minutes less than the University of Texas at El Paso on Saturday afternoon, but outscored the Miners 69-20  for the Red Raiders’ second win of the season. 
  
In just his sixth overall collegiate start, sophomore quarterback Patrick Mahomes II completed 18 of 33 passes with four touchdowns through the air. He also continued to show off his ability to run the ball, racking up 23 more yards on the ground and two rushing touchdowns. 
 
Overall on offense, the Red Raiders played even better than they did in week one, scoring on all but three of their 14 drives, and having seven different players get in the end zone. 
 
After his contribution last week rushing and on special teams, senior wide receiver Jakeem Grant made his impact with his catches this week. 
 
Grant had 141 yards receiving in the game, including a 60-yarder less than two minutes into the game for Tech’s first touchdown. 
 
The biggest change on offense from week one to week two was in the backfield. Senior running back DeAndre Washington returned to his form of last season, carrying the ball for 138 yards on 12 attempts. 
 
Sophomore running back Justin Stockton added 37 yards rushing, and also had one touchdown catch in the game for 46 yards. 
 
Defensively, Tech once again gave up close to 200 yards rushing, but 91 of that came on one rush by UTEP running back Aaron Jones. 
 
Jones did not stay in the whole game, however, suffering an injury to his left leg with less than a minute left in the first half. 
 
Tech won the turnover battle again as well forcing and recovering two fumbles in the game. Both of those turnovers led to scores by the Red Raider offense. 
 
Next on the schedule for Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury’s team is Arkansas next Saturday. The Red Raiders will then return home to take on Texas Christian in the first game of Big 12 Conference play.

299,"Eastern Oregon University freshman Steven Beaudry prepares to blast a shot on goal Saturday during a 2-1 loss to Sierra Nevada College (Nevada). 

The Eastern Oregon University men’s soccer team had a landmark day with its first match in program history Saturday.  In front of their home crowd, the Mountaineers put on a solid show and displayed what the future holds. 

About the only thing that didn’t go right was actually getting the ball in the net. 

Eastern controlled play for the majority of its season opener against Sierra Nevada College, generating countless scoring options. But the nerves of the first game cropped up at inopportune times, and it mustered just one goal in a 2-1 nonconference defeat at the EOU Soccer Field. 

“At the end of the day, the nerves got to us, I think,” Eastern head coach Stan Rodrigues said. “(Sierra Nevada) showed a lot of heart today, as well. But the jitters were definitely there. I didn’t sleep much last night, either. But it was good for us to come out and get punched in the mouth in the first game.”

2167,"SYCAMORE – Renovations at a few downtown businesses have been awarded facade grants. 
   
The Sycamore City Council on Monday approved the funds for the former DiMarzio building, on the corner of State and California streets, Shawn’s, 204 Somonauk St., and Princess Alex Ice Cream, 210 W. Elm St. Both requests were previously supported by the Architectural Review Committee. 

First Ward Alderman Alan Bauer sat in for Mayor Ken Mundy, who was out of town Monday. 

Curt Lang, 1st Ward Alderman, and his wife Karen requested facade grants after recently purchasing the former DiMarzio building, with plans to renovate the property with new windows, cleaned side brick, new roofing materials, gutters and downspouts. 

The estimated cost of the renovations is $40,000. 

The measure was approved 7-0, with Lang abstaining. Karen Lang spoke their behalf. 

“It’s been a big undertaking for us and so we’re excited about it,” she told the council. 

Third Ward Alderman Steve Braser commended the Langs for renovating the building, which the last time he knew of that happening was 60 years ago. 

Shawn Thrower, owner of Shawn’s and Princess Alex Ice Cream has requested facade grants for both his businesses. The repairs include replacing the shingled awning, installing roofing materials, adding lights under the awning to brighten the corner, repair and replace front panels, removing signs and painting the wood siding. 

The estimated cost of the exterior renovations are between $10,000 and $12,000. 

Funding for the Downtown Facade Grant Fund comes from a $25,000 transfer made from the Hotel/Motel Tax Fund, City Manager Brian Gregory said. 

“Currently, there’s several buildings within the past year that have undergone or are undergoing significant renovation, and the city has assisted with those renovations through the program,” Gregory said. “The sole source of revenue for the downtown development fund is the $25,000 transfer, and the fund is dedicated toward downtown improvement.” 

Once receipts for the renovations are received by the city, an applicant is eligible for a 50 percent match-up to $5,000 – in Thrower’s case, for each property. Since the Langs’ new property has four different addresses attached to the building the grant could total $20,000. 

“(Both grants) will take us over our annual allocation,” Gregory said. “However, we could amend the budget given there is a fund that is specifically set aside for these types of agreements, but haven’t been utilized in the past.”

3473,"She sparked controversy in 2012 when she returned to work just 2 weeks after giving birth to her son. Now, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer plans on taking a short 2 week maternity leave again despite expecting twin girls. 

Though the official maternity leave for Yahoo is 16 weeks, Marissa had this to say via her Tumblr page ; 

With great happiness, Zack and I have some exciting news to share – I’m pregnant! In fact, I’m expecting identical twin girls, likely arriving in December. The twins part was quite a surprise, because I have no family history of twins or any other predisposing factors. However, as I’ve now learned, identical twins occur by random chance in roughly 1 out of approximately every 300 pregnancies. Zack and I have embraced the surprise and are very excited about these new additions to our family. 

Since my pregnancy has been healthy and uncomplicated and since this is a unique time in Yahoo’s transformation, I plan to approach the pregnancy and delivery as I did with my son three years ago, taking limited time away and working throughout. I’ve shared the news and my plans with Yahoo’s Board of Directors and my executive team, and they are incredibly supportive and happy for me. I want to thank them for all of their encouragement as well as their offers of help and continued support. 

40 year old Mayer is one of the leading female CEOs in the world and her decision is once again sparking a major discussion. Some are commending her on not allowing her personal life interrupt her work while others are criticising her decision for setting unrealistic expectations for new mothers.

3166,"A dirty blond-haired woman in a tan raincoat buttoned up to her neck strolls past the diner where I am seated by the window. Normally, I don’t give passersby a second look at this time of the morning. Everyone is walking briskly on his or her daily routes heading to work or school. This woman stands out way too much to be part of the mass commute. No one these days wears a three-quarter-length trench coat with shoulder pads from the 80s. Instead, they are uniformly outfitted with backpacks or oversized shiny totes and short jackets busy texting or listening to their iTunes. When the woman comes back into my sight a second time as if retracing her steps, I realize she has another purpose being on 23rd street so early. Seconds later, she and a guy in a worn jeans jacket and patchy pants young enough to be her son, enter the front door and take a corner booth out of my sight. I get back to my toast and bacon with a glance at my watch realizing I would need to be on my way to the office shortly. Before I leave my tip, I glance over my shoulder and see that the two are huddled together and their hands are gesturing back and forth while they engage in a lively conversation, or argument. As I go up to the counter to pay my bill, the young guy brushes past me and disappears out the swinging door. When I leave, the woman is sitting there like a statue with her coat still buttoned up to her neck holding her coffee mug as if she is caressing it for comfort. I make a choice not to think about that scene anymore during the day and leave it there at the diner.

996,"IT had been the beating heart of Nelson Bay for more than 50 years, a place some gathered for a hit and others flocked to for after-dark shenanigans. IT had been the beating heart of Nelson Bay for more than 50 years, a place some gathered for a hit and others flocked to for after-dark shenanigans. And even as the smoke continued to billow out of Nelson Bay Golf Club on Sunday, its current custodians vowed to return bigger and better.

‘‘This is more than a golf club, it is a huge part of the community,’’ president Max Pride said.

‘‘It is the hub of a lot of people’s lives. It is devastating but we will get through it.’’

An early morning fire, believed to have started in the roof cavity, quickly spread to destroy the majority of the club. A huge verandah and the club’s pro-shop underneath may remain standing, but most of the building will need to be levelled and rebuilt.

The club’s 35 employees, as well as possibly a couple of dozen who work in the restaurant Blue Water Grill, are now without work.

Restaurant proprietor Will Semmens said the place was booked out for Father’s Day lunches and dinners.

Wedding receptions, sporting club presentation nights and other functions have also been affected.

The golf course was not damaged, and Mr Pride said it may reopen within days once a portable clubhouse is organised.

‘‘There is no impact on the golf course itself except for the fact that we can’t process green fees and the like,’’ he said.

The club was originally built in 1963, with multiple additions as the Tomaree peninsula grew and took the club with it.

It has about 3500 current members, including about 1500 playing members.

Social media was inundated with messages of sympathy.

Fire crews were first called about 12.30am but it was too late to save the club.

Firefighters were forced to withdraw from inside the club as the flames shot through the roof cavity, collapsing large sections onto what was once the club’s bar, auditorium, office and poker machine areas.

Crews remained at the scene for most of Sunday to help extinguish spot fires which flared up.

Some golfers who turned up for a spring round had been unaware of the fire and were turned away.

Fire investigators were looking into the source of the blaze, although early indications were that it began in the roof and quickly spread. The story first appeared on Newcastle Herald.",fde22945-db28-4223-a1b0-395a0d1a4960,News,2015-09-06T10:14:00Z,Glen Innes Examiner,Nelson Bay Golf Club vows to rebuild,0.0,News

684,"The global economic divergence which weighed on the US Federal Reserve's decision on Friday to hold rates near zero will be back on show this week with crucial central bank meetings in some of the countries most affected by the Chinese slowdown and weak commodity prices. The global economic divergence which weighed on the US Federal Reserve's decision on Friday to hold rates near zero will be back on show this week with crucial central bank meetings in some of the countries most affected by the Chinese slowdown and weak commodity prices. For starters, some analysts are tipping a second rate cut for the year in Norway, which has been grappling with slower growth and rising unemployment because of the slide in oil prices.

The Scandinavian country is the world's seventh largest oil exporter, and much of its industrial output is connected with the energy sector. Some analysts see gross domestic product slowing this year to 1.25 per cent from 2.25 per cent last year.

The response of Norges Bank, the country's central bank, has been to gradually cut the overnight lending rate - known as D-loans - from 2.5 per cent at the end of last year, to 2 per cent now. The policy bank deposit rate, meanwhile, has come down from 1.5 per cent to 1 per cent.

Norges Bank's executive board gathers on Thursday for its scheduled September meeting, with a further cut in the deposit rate in prospect.

​ ""We think that the Norges Bank will cut its policy rate from 1 per cent to 0.75 per cent,"" wrote Capital Economics economist Jack Allen.

Like Australia, which relies on commodity exports and Chinese demand for an important part of its growth, Norway has been caught up in the emerging market slowdown wrought by growing imbalances between global supply and demand.

Although prices of key minerals and agriculture products have stabilised in recent months, ongoing concerns about the true state of the Chinese economy, added to built-up - and so far unrealised - expectations of start to the first US tightening cycle in almost a decade have fuelled capital flight from commodity-exporter countries.

Tellingly, emerging market assets rallied on Friday when the Fed announced its decision to keep interest rates at their historic low of between zero and 0.25 per cent. This, however, is unlikely to last, says analysts.

""The increased focus on China by the Fed makes the timing of lift-off more uncertain and means an even greater focus will be placed on - sometimes questionable - Chinese monthly economic data,"" said UBS's head of investment strategy Tracey McNaughton.

""Unfortunately for investors, this therefore means volatility is here to stay a little longer,"" she said.

While the decline in commodity countries' currencies has helped exporters and import-exposed companies, some have fallen too far, stoking imported inflation and driving up the cost of US-denominated debt for companies and governments.

Brazil is a case in point. Battered by capital flight, the Banco Central do Brasil has been tightening monetary policy since mid-2013, with a series of increases pushing its reference rates from 7.25 per cent to 14.25 per cent today.

This tightening comes despite recession in South America's biggest economy, with the subsequent fiscal imbalances leading to a recent cut in Brazil's sovereign credit rating to ""junk"" status.

South Africa is another emerging market where investor outflows, and widening current account deficits, have trumped the need to stimulate a slowing economy. Like with Australia, China is South Africa's biggest single trading partner, and softening demand and metals prices have hit the economy hard.

""We have been affected by China's slowdown,"" Ngoako Ramatlhodi, the country's minister of mineral resources, told journalists in Hong Kong at the weekend

""Exports have dropped; diamond prices are going down.

""About 19,000 jobs in the mining industry are at risk,"" he said.

Many analysts are now tipping the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) to hike rates from 6 per cent to 6.25 per cent on Wednesday, although the Fed's decision on Friday may have ""added to the risk of another delay in the SARB's tightening cycle"", according to Capital Economics' economist for Africa John Ashbourne.

After losing more than 25 per cent of its value against the US dollar over the past year, the South African rand has begun to strengthen in recent weeks as investor flows return in anticipation of higher rates.

Even the Brazilian real, which has lost more than 60 per cent against the greenback in the past 12 months, received a little boost from the Fed's reluctance to lift rates on Friday.

However, the overarching global narrative remains the Fed's concerns about global growth, say analysts, and this will refuel negative sentiment about emerging markets.

""Global developments are clearly an influence on the Fed's policy moves; that much was again confirmed [on Friday],"" wrote Australia and New Zealand Banking group's economics team.

""So if that is the main driver of the Fed not hiking, and it seems to be, it is hard to see why the rally in some emerging markets and commodity currencies, which has emerged over recent days, should persist for too long.""

267,"Copyright 2015 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/. Transcript ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Another Putin conversation caught our eye this morning. A news alert said Russian president Putin asked Elton John not to feel offended over earlier prank phone call. We had to learn more, so we reached Bridget Kendall, the BBC's diplomatic correspondent, who is at least partially responsible for today's Putin-Elton summit. BRIDGET KENDALL: (Laughter). SHAPIRO: Welcome to the program. KENDALL: Well, it's not a summit yet. They haven't yet quite met face to face. SHAPIRO: Well, explain how this pop star renowned for ""Candle In The Wind,"" ""Crocodile Rock,"" songs from ""The Lion King"" wound up on the phone with the Russian president? KENDALL: Well, the important thing to understand is that Elton John isn't just a pop star. He's also, these days, a very active gay rights campaigner. And a couple of weeks ago, I caught up with him in Kiev in Ukraine and did an interview with him. We were talking about gay rights in Russia and Ukraine - quite a lot of problems with gay rights in Russia. They have laws which ban what they call homosexual propaganda. So asked him out of the blue, really, would you like to meet President Putin? And he immediately said, oh, yes, I'd love to do that; I'd love to sit down with him and have a cup of tea, he said in a very British way. So we thought that was great, and we put it out. We didn't think that it would go anywhere. But look where we are today. They've been talking on the phone. SHAPIRO: Well, between those two events, I was living in London up until last week and remember seeing headlines that Elton John posted on his Instagram account a photo of Vladimir Putin and said, what a delight it was to talk with Putin about LGBT issues. And then we learned that in fact, he wasn't talking to the real Putin. KENDALL: We called him people, and they said, yeah, no - definitely it was Vladimir Putin. We were absolutely sure it was. The Kremlin, though, was a bit silent for a bit, and then they came out and said, no, that wasn't us. SHAPIRO: So it was pranksters. KENDALL: When you think of it, you know, Elton John's office probably doesn't very often get calls Russian politicians, and how were they to know this President Putin in inverted comas would've been speaking Russian through a translator? It probably was quite hard to tell. But the Kremlin answered in a very interesting way. In the - they said, well, you know, they really ought to apologize to the British singer. And they also said they weren't against the idea of President Putin meeting Elton John. So I thought we got to keep an eye on this. And indeed today, when he was out in Southern Russia talking to people about the harvest, the Russian president apparently took time out of his schedule to call Elton John. Apparently, according to the Kremlin, he did it through the Russian ambassador in London. And apparently, perhaps not surprisingly, Elton John's office were a bit wary about whether this might be another prank, and it took him some time to persuade them. This time, the Russian president really did want to talk to him. But I spoke to his office not that long ago, and they said it had indeed taken place, this conversation, and they were very happy with it. And they were now looking at diaries to try and meet up. SHAPIRO: And do we know if there was any substantive conversation about LGBT issues, which was the original reason that Elton John wanted to speak to the Russian president? KENDALL: The impression I got from both sides was that they called in order to make formal contact to say that the two sides were ready to meet. And if they are going to sit down and talk about gay rights, that will happen face to face, which would be a very interesting meeting to eavesdrop on - don't know if that'll be possible. SHAPIRO: Bridget Kendall, diplomatic correspondent for the BBC, thank you so much for filling us in on this story. KENDALL: My pleasure.

720,"The work that is being done inside the school-turned-lofts in Davenport’s East Village now is visible from the outside. The old retaining wall on the south side of the Pierce School Lofts is being rebuilt, and the developers are taking extra pains to make sure it complements the historic district. 

“It was rotted railroad ties and crumbling concrete,” said Tim Baldwin, who is partnering with Pat Sherman to transform the old school. “We’re using manufactured block that is made to look like cut stone. 

“We’ll apply an acid etch and stain to give it a limestone color.” 

The project, which is getting $708,000 in housing tax credits through Iowa’s Economic Development Authority, has a total price tag of $8 million to $9 million. 

When finished next summer, the property at 2212 E. 12th St., will contain 41 housing units. 

“Everything is getting state and federal approval, because of the tax credits,” Baldwin said Thursday. “We can’t use the credits for the new wall or the parking lot, though.” 

The Economic Development Authority has a specific list, called Qualified Reimbursable Expenses, for the portions of the project where tax credits can be used. Other rules also apply, and the partners have made changes to the development to make sure they comply. 

“We really wanted to do a rooftop deck,” Baldwin said of the portion of the school that was added to the historic property in the 1970s. “We thought it would be a beautiful viewing area for the turn on the (Quad-City Times) Bix 7.” 

But it was not possible to provide access to the roof that would comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, he said. 

“Instead, we’ve designed the parking-lot layout in a way that creates a space for permanent bench seats with historic features around it,” Baldwin said. 

When finished, Pierce School Lofts will contain large, primarily one- and two-bedroom apartments. The units will be considerably larger, Baldwin said, than those inside the former Democrat building on Brady Street, which Baldwin and Sherman also rehabbed. 

The pair recently decided to add a studio unit, because the smaller, less-expensive living options have become increasingly popular in historic makeovers, Baldwin said. 
 
“The one bedrooms can go for $900 plus and the two-bedroom units can run from $1,300 to $1,400,” he said. “The lower studio pricing is in demand.” 

The target date for opening Pierce was June 2016, but the project is ahead of pace. 

“As it stands now, we’re running a couple months early,” Baldwin said. “We could hit some snags in the winter, but we’re in good shape now. 

“Everything is framed in, and we’ll be hanging (sheet) rock in the next couple of months, and the electrical, plumbing and HVAC are roughed-in.” 

Baldwin said he has been “disheartened” by one element of the work: Someone has been shooting a BB gun through some of the windows, which have been, “literally re-handcrafted. 

“Eventually, the building is going to have a sophisticated security system, but, for now, we’ve asked the police to help us keep an eye on things. 

“This project is going to clean up the neighborhood so much.”",bd08dfd8-b780-4812-a480-f0284e58a1bf,News,2015-09-07T18:06:00Z,QC Times,Historic Pierce School project showing some progress,0.0,News

3588,"CHARLESTON, SC (WCSC) - 

The Burke High School football team prepared for kickoff Friday night under the lights at Johnson Hagood Stadium, which stands directly across the street from Stoney Field, their home stadium.

Wednesday, community members rallied to keep the Bulldogs' game downtown, despite poor field conditions at Stoney Field, which school officials deemed unsafe to play on.

Burke was initially scheduled to play Friday's game at Ravenel Stadium, on the old St. Andrew's High School campus in West Ashley.

""We want action. Action speaks louder than words and we've been waiting too long,"" Rep. Wendell Gilliard said.

In a 2011 land agreement between the City of Charleston, and Charleston County School District, the deal called for CCSD to renovate the field, using more than $2 million dollars owed the City, instead putting it towards that project. That money would come from the district's capital cycle between 2016-2021.

To date, renovations have not begun.

""The big issue here is not to save Stoney Field, but to build what we need,"" retired Burke football coach Earl Brown said. Brown led the football team on Stoney Field for nearly 30 years.

Built in the early 1960's, the field suffered major damage after Hurricane Hugo, and has been renovated 14 times. For the second time this season, conditions on the field have been ruled unsafe to play because of soggy ground, that's also sinking.

""Well, it was built on a garbage dump,"" retired Army Sgt. Herman Allen said. Allen served on a committee to maintain Stoney Field, which included getting it ready for game day. ""It was revealed that it was a mutual agreement between the city and the school district.""

Eight years later, Allen still holds a copy of plans from 2007 to renovate the stadium.

""Well that never transpired,"" he said. ""I would love to see that individual that took that two million dollars and stuck in their pocket and went home, because it didn't go to Stoney Field.""

Attempts to get a response from the school district have been unsuccessful. 

Gilliard has called a meeting with city leaders on Sept. 25 on the issue.",abbac11f-2a07-4f29-8b4d-a38d09c10a0c,News,2015-09-18T22:51:00Z,WSFA,"Despite agreement, questions remain about Stoney Field renovation plans",0.0,Blog

New games, new modes.  By Sega and Sports Interactive have announced three new Football Manager games that are scheduled for release this year. 
 
As expected, Football Manager 2016 will be coming out on PC and Mac, but Football Manager Touch will also be coming out for PC and tablets. Previously known as Football Manager Classic, Touch is the quick play mode which has been within the full game before (and for tablets since March). This is the first time it will be available separately through Steam and on tablets. Football Manager Mobile will also be coming to all iOS and Android devices. 
 
“For some time now it’s been clear to us that there is no ‘one size fits all’ football management experience,” says Sports Interactive head Miles Jacobson. ""The introduction of Football Manager Touch as a standalone offering – playable across computer and tablet – means that we now offer something for everyone.” 
 
As for new features, FM2016 now includes a create-a-club mode, and a fantasy draft mode where you compete with other managers to build a squad from scratch with a fixed budget, followed by a mini-league. Other tweaks and additions include more manager customization options, a set piece creator, more realistic injuries, extended press interaction, and improved AI transfers. 
 
FM Touch will also have the create-a-club mode, and it will have cross-save, so a career saved to the cloud can be accessed on your tablet or your PC. 
 
Pre-ordering FM2016 from participating retailers will also grant you a key for An Alternative Reality: the Football Manager Documentary. Additionally, you'll gain access to the full beta two weeks before the game launches. 
 
The full Football Manager 2016 is scheduled for release on November 13, with Football Manager Touch and Mobile available ""before Christmas."" 
 
In IGN's review of last year's Football Manager 2015 , we said that ""better menu layouts, countless new options and improved match-day features see FM2015 remain in title-winning form.""

Where: NBC. 
    
Judi Shekoni is happy not to have to wear heels on the 13-episode miniseries “Heroes Reborn,” which is something of a sequel to the NBC sci-fi series that first aired in 2006. 

At 5-foot-11, the British actress didn’t have to worry about her male co-star being too short, which is sometimes a problem for tall women in Hollywood. In “Heroes Reborn,” Shekoni plays Joanne Collins. Her husband, Luke, is played by former “Chuck” star Zachary Levi, who is 6-foot-3. 

“I needed a whole lot of man and I got it,” she jokes. 
  
But don’t think that the Collinses are “Heroes,” the ordinary people of the show’s title who have developed superpowers of one sort or another. As shown in the finale of the original series, the existence of “Evos” — as they are referred to on the new show — has been revealed to the public and since coming out in the open the Evos have been blamed for a massive terrorist attack. Already paranoid about the Evos’ existence, the world turns against them. 

But the Collinses have even more of a reason to hate Evos than most people. The couple lost a son in the attack and are out for revenge. Taking up arms, they are on a mission to track down those they believe are responsible. 
  
“They say there are seven stages of grief and Joanne got stuck on anger,” says Shekoni about her character. “She’s wonderful to play, willing to go toe-to-toe with anybody.” 

The actress, who began her career as a model and split time between London and Los Angeles, says she thinks of Joanne and Luke as a mixture of “Natural Born Killers” and “Mr. and Mrs. Smith,” two movies she likes very much. 

“We’re very imposing looking,” she notes, referring to her and Levi, “especially with all our weapons.” 

The fact that Joanne is “not really a heels kind of girl” is a nice change of pace, Shekoni observes. 
  
“As a woman, you often have to worry about your hair, makeup and outfits,” she says. “With this it was, ‘Can I act with a gun, and can I move fast?’” 
Where to watch...

Nicole, YOU SAID the Lutheran church was named BY HIM.....IT WAS NOT. Also He did not leave, he was excommunicated......two entirely different matters. Do you think Martin Luther was the ONLY person who questioned the evil the RCC had become? Hardly Nicole. Luther wanted CHANGE within the RCC, and rightly so. The RCC became wealthy off the backs of peasants, and corruption within, even to today as we see Pope Francis is still cleaning CORRUPTION out of the RCC. Makes me wonder what would have been the outcome if Pope Francis was Pope at the time of Luther. ---kathr4453 on 9/20/15 Nicole, we also know the RCC in these past years have had a mass exodus because of the evil of pedophiles the Church was covering up and even protecting. EGO again has nothing to do with calling evil evil. It's called CONSCIENCE. It's called righteousness, it's called TRUTH. The history of the Borgas is also well known. Telling poor souls they can PAY for the deceased in pergetory is pure corruption. BUT the RCC needed money to buy back property lost in a poker game and came up with that. You hate that Luther EXPOSED all this corruption? And 99 in all. Because of the reformation the RCC was forced to clean their own house, but ONLY AFTER their corruption was exposed. You should be thanking Martin Luther. ---kathr453 on 9/20/15 1 Peter 1:18-19
18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers,
19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:
We see Nicole that SCRIPTURE Clearly shows one cannot buy another's soul out of a fictitious place. Listen carefully to YOUR so called first Pope. ---kathr445 on 9/20/15 Cluny said, ""I've tried several times. He things the Bible is the same as Jesus.""
I think Samuel statement is very appropriate in responding to Cluny's Statement, ""
Those who do not have good arguments or verses for their views. Often resort to juvenile remarks, snide comments and personal attacks."" excellent point Samuel... thanks man... ---john9346 on 9/20/15 Jerry said, ""Peter was DEAD when Luther lived. Did you expect him to practice necromancy?""
But Peters successor (Pope Leo X) was alive, and that is who Martin Luther should have gone to.
Pray for me,
the unworthy monk Brendan ---Monk_Brendan on 9/20/15 I have read where Paul rebuked Peter. Galatians 2:11
But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.
Where he meet with James, Peter (Cephas) and John. Gal 2:9
And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship, that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.
Where Peter was for Circumcised and Paul for gentiles. See Galatians 2:8. Which would make Paul the Pope not Peter.
He did spend some time with Peter and James. Who headed the council Peter had to report to James too. Galatians 1:18,19. Acts 10, 15:19 21:8
AGape ---Samuelbb7 on 9/20/15 Nicole: ""Samuel, Paul went to Peter when there was a conflict, Luther didn't.""
Peter was DEAD when Luther lived. Did you expect him to practice necromancy?
---jerry6593 on 9/20/15 Kathr, Luther was warned SEVERAL times and indeed was excommunicated, by his choice. He was a RCC Priest, DUMMY he was not.
You can't debate because you take things TOO PERSONALLY.
Why do you think I hate Luther? Did I say I did? NOPE.
Show me my lie. Copy and Paste and lets debate it.
You made a statement claiming The Lutheran Church wasn't name after Martin Luther to ME accusing me of being derogatory to him.
When I give you proof with common sense, you get mad.
Really?
Sorry if I hurt your feeling.
But, don't attack me and get mad if I DEFEND myself.
Rob, Cluny answered you well.
Samuel, Paul went to Peter when there was a conflict, Luther didn't.

rob, please show me the hard evidence that people worship the Pope.
(If anyone does, it's despite the teaching of their church, not because of it.)
Show me from the Scriptures where you find the terms ""accept Christ,"" ""personal savior,"" ""rapture"", invitation hymns, altar calls, and revivals.
Glory to Jesus Christ! ---Cluny on 9/19/15 Nicole Lacey, please show from Scripture where the Apostle Paul told people to call the Pope the Holy Father, to bow and too Worship the Pope. Show where people are told to pray to the Virgin Mary, say Hail Mary, and pray the Rosary. ---Rob on 9/19/15 Wow Nicole, first you insist Luther named a Church after himself, and NOW ...what? Change the context and subject of the conversation? Just say, OK I was wrong. But no Nicloe you can't do that can you. You had to instead spew all sorts of hate and put YOUR twist on it insisting now his EGO really liked it, AND that he had the power to stop the RCC from naming those they called heretics after the heretic. This is why it's hard to debate with you Nicole, because when you are shown the truth, you can't just accept it at face value. YOU have to LIE and TWIST the truth to somehow insist YOU were right all along. But worse yet is your obvious HATRED of Luther. Were you there Nicole? Isn't the truth Luther was excommunicated? ---kathr4453 on 9/19/15 Luther through reading scripture had an awakening of CONSCIENCES, after reading Romans ( proving the Word of God is LIVING AND POWERFUL AND STRONGER THAN A TWO EDGE SWORD) again proving scripture that those who SEEK will find the truth. There is a difference between SEEKERS, and those who just follow and believe what they are told. Luther never insisted others follow him, but gave others the same opportunity of being able to read the Bible for themselves, where FAITH COMES BY HEARING THE WORD OF GOD. Not hearing the word of man. You can't LEGALIZE FAITH. If perchance you understood that Nicole, you would be a seeker and not a follower. ---kathr453 on 9/19/15 Nicole you proved your point that Luther and the Lutheran church.
But he followed the Teachings of Paul and left the traditions of men. He supported following the Bible and using it as the final rule of what is doctrine. Paul and Jesus fought against traditions that Jewish leaders had built up instead of following the law of GOD. Mark 7:7-11
Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.
For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men,...
And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.
For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother, and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:.... ---Samuelbb7 on 9/19/15 kathr, Common sense tears your statements to pieces. A RC Priest decides leave THE RCC, and changes the traditions Paul told us to hold to them.
The hardest part is tell people to believe in him so much they are banking on their enteral life.
They followed him even after being excommunicated.
Mather Luther HAD that much POWER over the people to leave what is known to an unknown on his belief system.
But you want me to believe He COULDN'T STOP THEM FROM NAMING THE NEW CHURCH AFTER HIM??????? REALLY?? THE egoistic was smiling ear to ear.
Because a MAN who can convince you to leave your core faith, CAN tell you to remove my name from the Church. Didn't happen because he like it named after him. ---Nicole_Lacey on 9/18/15 \\Certainly wouldn't want to enlighten him would you.\\

Eck and other Catholics followed the traditional practice of naming a heresy after its leader, thus labeling all who identified with the theology of Martin Luther as Lutherans.
Martin Luther always disliked the term, preferring instead to describe the reform movement with the term Evangelical, meaning ""good news"", i.e. ""Gospel.
Eventually Lutherans themselves began to use the term Lutheran in the middle of the 16th century in order to distinguish themselves from other groups, such as the Philippists and Calvinists. ---kathr4453 on 9/18/15 The RCC used the derogatory name Lutherens, not Martin Luther.---kathr4453 on 9/16/15 Do you know how silly that sounds?

He protested Catholicism long before Luther. Actually Wycliffe was never RCC in the first place was he? What about Hess, again never RCC and long before Luther. The RCC HATED Wycliffe.

Glory to Jesus Christ! ---Cluny on 9/17/15 Yes Kathyr it stated as a derogatory term by the RCC. They recognized that Luther was the founder of that denomination which they labeled as heretical because they taught salvation was by Grace alone through faith alone. ""In 1521 Edict of Worms: The edicts of the Diet condemned Luther and officially banned citizens of the Holy Roman Empire from defending or propagating his ideas, subjecting advocates of Lutheranism to forfeiture of all property,..."" Salvation in the RCC was based on works of saints and people with grace helping. Or pushing as it says in some catechisms. Some took this to mean once saved always saved.

So let's take a look at the Baptists:
Salvation involves the redemption of the whole man, and is offered freely to all who accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour, who by His own blood obtained eternal redemption for the believer. In its broadest sense salvation includes regeneration, justification, sanctification, and glorification. I am sure that there are some Protestants who would disagree about this statement.
I am also sure that if I posted beliefs of Lutherans or Presbyterians, there are some that would disagree about those things

Kathr as far as Lutheran Church it was name by him because He LEFT the RCC and started teaching his view of what a Church should be.
As many do RIGHT NOW. They start another Church because they disagreed with their Pastor's version of being Christian.
That's why there are 60,000 and growing Protestant Churches.
Luther stated the process of if you disagree with the belief start you own Church.
Others came to the same conclusion when they didn't like Luther's vision of a Church.
You wrote all that and still having NAME one Church being the same when the 5 Reformer rebelled. ---Nicole_Lacey on 9/16/15 While Luther believed the Pope was the Antichrist he did not reject all the doctrines of the RCC. Nor of the Christian church which preceded it.
The Lutheran church was based on the Bible and the understanding that Luther taught. It looks to him as it's founder and he is alsco called the leader of the Reformation and Protestantism. So while your point is true. I consider it nitpicking. Peter was called on the carpet before James in the Jerusalem council. So how could he have been the sole leader. A doctrine not from the Original church.

Name a Church reformed after the 16th Century by a Reformer who STARTED the Church DURING HIS LIFE TIME.
Lutheran is an example. Luther was one of the 5.
His Church is called Lutheran because he started it.
BUT, the Lutheran Church has broken into several branches not under one Bishop.
Now by following those rules, please name one. ---Nicole_Lacey on 9/15/15 It took awhile and scholars to work out an official canon. But it was done and finished by the 5th Century. The RCC actually fired Martin Luther because of his stand against the Rank hypocrisy and corruption going on. They labeled him a Heretic and he labeled the Pope the Antichrist. He also married a ex nun. Paul was approved by three people. Cephas means stone and is a nick name for Peter.
Galtions 2:9

Really?
Luther was a Catholic Priest.
The Lutheran Church was stared at the same time Luther was alive. His name, his church. Common Sense.
Since the Lutheran Church isn't the RCC, then Luther HAD TO HAVE LEFT the RCC to have a Church named after his name.

Luther never founded a church, and never left the RCC. But yes, your right, because of that we have churches built upon MAN. I'm of Calvin, I'm of Luther, I'm of Wesley, I'm of Apollo, I'm of Polycarp. And to have Polycarp interpretation of scripture held up as THE AUTHORITY of scripture, is insulting. Even in Paul's day it was common, he describes as carnality. But the RCC's answer is even worse. Paul never insisted on one man, or any man, the Pope, heading the church either. Christ is the HEAD, and all wisdom and knowledge come directly from Him to His Body....us. No middleman necessary. ---kathr4453 on 9/15/15 Kathyr.

The Reformers partially succeeded. Their actions brought about the counter reformation in which the worst of abuses of the RCC were curbed. You need to read some true history. There are Historians who give the facts. Nor rewrite the History of the Church to whitewash the events.

True believers in the Cross, proclaimed the Gospel....... ---kathr4453 on 9/13/15 Read These Insightful Articles About Health Insurance Samuel BB said, ""...Both place traditions above scripture in their understanding of doctrine.""
First, let us define a word. Tradition does not mean the number of beads on a rosary, or the vestments a priest wears, etc. Tradition does mean the things that have come down through the ages, like the writings of St. Ignatius of Antioch, and the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom
Also, Tradition means fasting, prayer, almsgiving, feeding the hungry, giving water to the thirsty, clothing the naked, and visiting the sick and those in jail.

Friend, Jewish people don't like you to call the Torah the OT.
Because the OT and NT makes up the Bible which means Testifying about who? Jesus being the Messiah.
Here's a hint why: they don't BELIEVE Jesus is the Messiah.
Just in case you didn't know.
What are friends for if not to give a little information.

Yes, because the RCC knows there isn't a Church still standing today left by a Reformer.

Oh, you are making my point.
Thanks buddy.

Both have changed and modified their doctrine and it is recorded in history. So why should not the true Reformers go back to the original documents and use them as the foundation of their church.

The word 'reform' means to re do the original.
So, if the original isn't in the new it is hasn't been reformed.
If you have an old house that needs re-fixing, but the owner of the house refuses to allow you to touch it, so instead you build a new house copying the old house to the last nail.
Have you remodeled the old house, or just built a new house?
Can you claim you remodeled the old house?
No! As to the RCC, She has reformed Herself as Jesus instructed Her. Name one Church started by the famous 5 Reformers that is one, strong and GROWING today? ---Nicole_Lacey on 9/11/15 Brendan you asked, ""Is REFORMED Theology Reformed Catholicism?""
1. The reformation means to go back to that which was (from the beginning)
2. Catholicism means universal (referring to church)
3. The reformers wanted to reform the rcc, but realize it was impossible which led to ways to return to the beginning.
4. Reform Theology is built on the 5 Solas (Scripture Alone, Grace Alone, Christ Alone, Faith Alone, and for the glory of God Alone.)

3002,"Avengers star Tom Hiddleston revealed that the Oscar buzz surrounding his highly anticipated portrayal of country music legend Hank Williams all seems ""imaginary"" as the movie received its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. 
 
The British actor, best known for his role as the villainous Loki in the Marvel superhero franchise, sings some of Williams' most famous country standards in the film I Saw The Light. 
 
He said he received a comprehensive education in the singer's impact on music. 
 
Speaking on the red carpet at the premiere at the Ryerson Theatre in Toronto, Hiddleston said: ""His music has left this extraordinary legacy and the songs he wrote like Hey, Good Lookin' and Cold, Cold Heart and I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry and Your Cheatin' Heart were country standards that singer like Ray Charles and Tony Bennett and Johnny Cash went on to cover, so I knew the songs but I didn't realise he was so young when he died. 
 
""He was 29 years old and left this legacy, Bob Dylan talks about his legacy, Bruce Springsteen talks about him and in some of his early songs you can hear rock and roll. 
 
""There is a song called Move It On Over and you can hear Rock Around The Clock coming round the corner in ten years' time so that was really exciting to me to realise where Hank sits in the stepping stones of twentieth century music."" 
 
Williams died from heart failure in 1953 after battling alcohol and pills while dealing with intense fame and scrutiny. 
 
Asked about the comparisons between Williams' fame and the attention Hiddleston has received, he said: ""His version of fame was very extreme and there is something more naked about being a singer-songwriter than being an actor perhaps, but certainly I think he struggled with the commercialism of what came from his heart and soul. 
   Promoted stories   
""He used to say 'they are slicing me up and selling me like baloney', so I think he really struggled with the idea that he was part of a machine that was about making money, whereas for him it was about communicating something to people and sharing that feeling and any creative person can relate to it in some way."" 
 
Hiddleston has already been mentioned as a possible contender in the best actor race when the Academy Awards roll around in 2016, but he said it is too far away to contemplate. 
 
""I can't really comment on that because it all seems so imaginary, it's really nothing to do with me in a way, so we will see what people say when they see the film."" 
 
The Toronto International Film Festival runs until September 20. 
 
The Bourne Identity star Matt Damon braved the Toronto rain for the world premiere of his new film, The Martian. 
 
Ridley Scott's big budget epic tells the story of an astronaut battling to survive on Mars alone after his Nasa crewmates leave him behind, mistakenly believing he is dead. 
 
The film, which also stars Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kate Mara and Kristen Wiig, maintains a sense of humour throughout, which Damon says is the key to its charm. 
 
""There would have been another way to tell this story that wouldn't have been as entertaining, that would have been an exercise in existential reality. 
 
""But the way we chose to go was fun and uplifting and optimistic ultimately, and that was the tone we were happy with because that is a good thing to put out into the world given what the headlines are."" 
 
Scott has long been on Damon's wishlist as a collaborator.

3978,"David Cameron faces a legal challenge over the decision to target Islamic State (IS) terrorists in Syria despite Parliament refusing approval for air strikes. 
 
The Prime Minister revealed earlier this month that an RAF drone had killed two Britons in an attack near the city of Raqqa, describing the action as an ""act of self defence"". 
 
The Green Party's Caroline Lucas MP and Baroness Jones have joined forces with human rights charity Reprieve to take the first step towards a judicial review. 
 
In a pre-action letter to the Defence Secretary and Attorney General, lawyers for the politicians argue that the Government has either failed to formulate a ""targeted killing policy"" or failed to publish it. Both positions are illegal under domestic and international law, the letter says. 
 
""The Raqqa strike, and the intention of the Government to pre-authorise targeted killings in the future in countries where the UK is not at war, is of concern to the claimants and many others,"" they write. 
 
""The concern is heightened by the lack of clarity about the circumstances in which the Government reserves the right to kill British citizens outside of an armed conflict."" 
 
The letter says the Government has variously stated the drone strike was justified due to ""potential"", ""direct"", ""likely"" or ""imminent"" threats to the UK. 
   Promoted stories   
""Such a lack of clarity as to the test which is being applied by the Government in deciding whether to pre-authorise the targeted killing of British nationals or individuals overseas raises real and serious concerns over the lawfulness of the Government's past and expected resort to the use of lethal force,"" it insists. 
 
""It is unclear what, if any, policies, procedures and/or safeguards are in place to ensure that this 'new departure' is only exercised in accordance with domestic and international law."" 
 
Britain is carrying out air strikes against IS in Iraq, but not in Syria after the Commons refused to approve the action.

SAN JOSE, Calif. Former San Francisco 49ers defensive lineman Ray McDonald pleaded not guilty on Friday to a charge of rape by intoxication of a woman who reported being sexually assaulted at his home last December. 

McDonald, 31, has remained free on $100,000 bond since shortly after his arrest last month in the case, marking the latest criminal charges brought against a National Football League player. 

Defense lawyers entered the not guilty plea on his behalf in Santa Clara County Superior Court. The eight-year NFL veteran, dressed in a pinstripe suit, was silent, except to answer, ""Yes, your honor"" to procedural questions put to him by the judge. 

McDonald, who has previously asserted that he and his accuser had a consensual sexual encounter, did not address reporters outside the courthouse. He walked without comment to a waiting sport utility vehicle and was driven away. 

If convicted, he faces up to eight years in prison. 

Current 49ers linebacker Ahmad Brooks has been charged separately with misdemeanor sexual battery of McDonald's alleged victim on the same night. His charge carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail. 

Judge Shelyna Brown granted a request by McDonald's lawyers to seal grand jury transcripts in the case, which Deputy District Attorney Chris Lameiro did not oppose. 

Prosecutors have divulged few details about the circumstances of the alleged assault. 

In a civil lawsuit brought by McDonald's accuser, the woman said she repeatedly slipped on the pool deck of his home and fell, losing consciousness from a head injury…",4afcf991-7378-4277-a651-c6b4297cc910,News,2015-09-26T02:34:50Z,MyInforms,Former NFL player McDonald pleads not guilty to rape,0.0,Blog

Harmonix has not announced a PC version of Rock Band 4, primarily due to piracy concerns, but with its director competitor Activision releasing Guitar Hero Live this year on PS4, Xbox One, Wii U, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, iOS, and Android, Harmonix might need to change its priorities and open up to the idea of releasing on more than two platforms. Of course, one reason Harmonix has for only releasing on PS4 and Xbox One is due to Rock Band 4’s ability to allow players to use their old Rock Band instruments, as well as a pre-existing catalog of downloaded songs from previous Rock Band titles in Rock Band 4.

2773,"The Health division of Wolters 
      Kluwer , a leading global provider of information and point of 
      care solutions for the healthcare industry, announced today that Health 
      Language experts will lead a breakout session titled 'A 
      Strategic Approach to Terminology Management Challenges in Population 
      Health and Analyticsâ€� at the 87 th Annual AHIMA Convention and Exhibit . Stephen Ross, M.D., 
      Medical Informatics Specialist, and Brian Laberge, Director of Client 
      Services Strategy, will discuss the critical role terminology management 
      strategies play in achieving success with population health management 
      (PHM) and data analytics.  
  
Scheduled for September 30 at 11:15 a.m. in Rooms 271-273 of the New 
      Orleans Convention Center, the presentation will highlight the 
      challenges healthcare organizations currently face when laying a 
      foundation for semantic interoperability. Presenters will discuss the 
      need for efficient strategies to address data normalization of clinical 
      terminologies coming from inbound and outbound sources, and attendees 
      will learn the value of enterprise code group management and how to 
      align a broader enterprise terminology management strategy with data 
      analytics and PHM efforts. 
 
Identified as important strategies for healthcare organizations 
      operating within risk-bearing reimbursement arrangements, PHM and data 
      analytics require high-level information sharing capabilities. Because 
      the industry lacks a universal terminology standard, data must be 
      normalized upon intake to support semantic interoperability; otherwise 
      there are inevitable conflicts with management and distribution when 
      clinical information is shared between organizations. 
 
'As the movement to value-based care marches forward, healthcare 
      organizations must deploy infrastructures that will support 
      sophisticated data analytics and effective management of population 
      health,â€� said David A. Del Toro, President & CEO of Clinical Software 
      Solutions at Wolters Kluwer. 'Terminology management strategies are 
      foundational to this process, and Health Language solutions are on the 
      leading edge of this movement, equipping healthcare organizations with 
      the technology-enabled workflows and capabilities needed to position for 
      success.â€� 
 
Designed to enable effective clinical information exchange, the Health 
      Language family of products including LEAP Code Group Manager will be 
      featured at AHIMA (Booth #812). Wolters Kluwer's enterprise terminology 
      management platform provides the software, content, and consulting 
      solutions needed to map, translate, update, and manage standard and 
      enhanced clinical terminologies on an enterprise scale, enabling the 
      information liquidity required to support such healthcare challenges as 
      Meaningful Use compliance, ICD-10 conversion, population health 
      management, and analytics.

Preview 

Pakistan will aim to seal the two-match T20 cricket series against hosts Zimbabwe when they face off at the Harare Sports Club on Tuesday. 

The visitors held their nerve to win the opening match on Sunday by 13 runs, defending a modest total of 136 thanks to left-arm Imad Wasim heroics. 

The 26-year-old Wasim finished with figures of 4 for 11 from four overs, and was named man of the match having also contributed 19 runs from just 12 balls. 

“The batsmen need to take up their responsibility,” said Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi after Sunday’s victory. 

“The bowlers used the pitch, and I am very happy with the bowlers, especially Imran Khan in that last over.” 

Pakistan slumped to 29 for three early in their innings as seamer Chamu Chibhabha grabbed three wickets in six deliveries. 

Afridi even backed Imad to eventually replace spin ace Saeed Ajmal in the side. 

“Imad displayed some extraordinary skill and he can be an alternate to Ajmal,” said the skipper. 

Defeat for Zimbabwe means they have now failed to beat Pakistan in eight T20 internationals. 

“We just lost too many wickets at the end,” Zimbabwe captain Elton Chigumbura said in the post match conference. “We have come close on many occasions but we keep on losing. 

“I’m not going to sit here and make excuses, at the end of the day we were chasing 137 and, despite how well they bowled and how well their spinner [Imad] bowled, it’s just a score that you need to get. We were supposed to get that score, with the kind of players we have.”

2554,"I’ve voiced my hatred for Konami on way too many occasions on this site, but I still think it’s for good reason. From a beloved company that published some of the best gaming franchises in the world, to a hollowed out mess that should honestly be euthanized. While the terrible events kind of trickled down for a while, the biggest shock came when they flat out cancelled Silent Hills, a game that looked like it had so much potential and was probably going to be the next revelation in the survival horror genre. 
 
After that we heard reports of Hideo Kojima being treated like garbage and that the company was actively pushing him out, nevermind that his games put the damn place on the map in the first place. Then shit just got stupid with them releasing Pachinko machines, Japanese gambling machines, of our favourite franchises, reducing them to nothing but novelty items. It was physically and symbolically abhorrent.

We also knew that they were going to focus primarily on the mobile market in the future and this is for obvious reason. Mobile has the best return on investment. Konami have completely lost touch with what gaming is and have shown no remorse to the legion of dedicated fans it was actively alienating. They became a hollow shell of their former self and one that pains me to witness. 
 
A recent report from French site, Gameblog , stated that Konami is now officially done with AAA game development and with the exception of Pro Evolution Soccer which does count, I guess. This report has since been confirmed to be factual. MGS V was possibly the last major AAA game that we will see from Konami. 
 
Konami have officially packed their bags and called it in. They will not be relevant anymore in the gaming industry and will only be a painful reminded every time we see their name on some free-to-play nonsense on app stores. Our favourite franchises will either be whored out on mobile or be forgotten within the annals of gaming. 
 
It’s been a good run Konami. We wish you didn’t fly off the goddamn handle and still produced some of the most beloved games in gaming history, but this is the road you picked. I genuinely hope you fail miserable and crash and burn into obscurity. 
 
Fuck Konami.

5538,"Summary Yahoo has been one of the most ""pumped"" names over the last six months. Many investors have gotten caught up in the SOTP. But there's no free lunch in event-driven investing. The illustrious sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuation has caught many Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) investors with their pants down. When every Tom, Dick and Harry is pumping a SOTP it never ends well. Wall Street didn't help the case and it's still fueling the fire - there are 42 analysts without a single sell rating on Yahoo. 65% of those ratings are buys and they are promising 50% upside, based on the average price target.
The latest round of shareholder punishment was dished out by the IRS, driving shares briefly below $30 a share. The IRS refused to definitively say that Yahoo could spin off its Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) stake tax-free to shareholders. The silver lining is that the IRS didn't offer an adverse ruling. So the ultimate result is still in limbo.So you're saying there's a chance
Yahoo could push ahead with the spinoff and then face the IRS in court over whether it should be taxed. A rather reckless move that knowingly puts shareholder capital at risk. It could try to redo its plan for the spinoff and resubmit it.
Yahoo has likely already spent a small fortune with lawyers, so it should push forward to find a viable option, whether it be getting the company sold or spinning off the core Yahoo business instead of Alibaba.
As far as the valuation goes, we've heard the story for nearly a year that if you do the SOTP valuation it's grossly undervalued. The market is giving you the core business for free. Yet, I've seen the Yahoo valuation done wrong a number of times. SOTP is just as dangerous as the discounted cash flow - it's never as easy as plugging a few numbers into a spreadsheet.Can new management save Yahoo?
A new management team could likely navigate monetizing Alibaba and Yahoo Japan while stabilizing the core business better. However, investors are somewhat stuck with Mayer given the pregnancy, where it's unlikely that the board will oust her, nor will an activist get involved.
So you have to make the bet that Mayer can channel her inner John Malone - the puppet master behind Liberty Media (NASDAQ:LMCA) who has made various spinoffs and acquisitions over the years. Liberty just spun off shares of TripAdvisor with a small operating business last year.
But, firstly, the IRS is looking to change the rules mid-game which is bad for Yahoo. Still, let's get another thing straight, Mayer is no John Malone. Per the Liberty annual meeting conference call in June, Malone was asked about doing tax free spinoffs going forward in light of the potential changes by the IRS and spinoff tax rules.
The conversation led to Yahoo, where Malone noted that the Yahoo spinoff proposal is effectively a spinoff of an investment company, which is pretty naked. ""We've never done anything that naked,"" said Malone. Another Liberty Media executive chimed in that the IRS is worried that Yahoo is trying to spin off ""cash"" tax free to shareholders.
Basically, Yahoo's plan includes a series of assets that does not have an operating business behind it. What's best for Yahoo right now is to go back to the drawing table and figure out how to package the spin so that it's more ""business"" than ""cash."" At the same time, I'm not sure how that impacts Yahoo's core business if it starts stripping away meaningful parts.Everything is a buy at a certain price
I understand the importance of being agnostic and being able to reassess when the facts change. The problem I have with most SOTP analyses on Yahoo is the assumption that the market is grossly mis-valuing Yahoo. Yet, it's properly valuing a Chinese company (Alibaba) and a Japanese company (Yahoo Japan).
Now, even if you mitigate out those risks with short positions, you're still betting that Yahoo will not put its cash into a dumpster and set it on fire (via a large misplaced acquisition) and that you can put a reasonable multiple on its core business.
But, in truth, you would almost have to pay me to own their core business. Theoretically, if I could get the core business for 1x EBITDA I'd be happy, then apply a hefty discount of 25% on the cash - and assuming a fully taxed Alibaba spin and a 15% liquidity discount on Yahoo Japan, then I'd be willing to pay somewhere around $20 to $25 a share for Yahoo.
Shares were at $50 a share at the start of the year. Some investors are sitting on a 40% paper loss. At this point, do you just hold and hope for the best? If it were me (easy to say) I'd chalk the loss up to tuition for a market education on SOTP and event driven investing.
Be greedy when others are fearful is a famous saying in the market. It also works both ways - be fearful when others are greedy. With event driven investing, it pays to understand probabilities and risk, especially regulatory risk. Disclosure: I am/we are long LMCA.

294,"Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that Congress should repeal the unpopular ""Cadillac tax,"" an Obamacare tariff on premium health care plans. 
 
The tax is set to go into effect in 2018. 

Clinton said that while the Affordable Care Act -- one of President Barack Obama's top legislative achievements -- was ""working, plain and simple,"" there were some changes that needed to be made. 

""I have proposed new reforms to build on the progress we've made and lower out-of-pocket costs for families,"" said Clinton in a statement. ""That's why, among other steps, I encourage Congress to repeal the so-called Cadillac tax, which applies to some employer-based health plans, and to fully pay for the cost of repeal."" 

Clinton said some of her proposed reforms to Obamacare, which she has rolled out in the past month, would more than cover the cost of repealing the Cadillac tax, a measure that helped to pay for the health care reform law. 

Clinton's campaign first said the candidate disapproved of the Cadillac tax during a call earlier this month with the American Federation of Teachers, a powerful union that has endorsed Clinton. 

The call was first reported Tuesday by The New York Times. Shortly after the story was published, Clinton's campaign released a statement calling on Congress to repeal the tax. 

Union members, many of whom enjoy the generous employer-based coverage plans, would be hit by the 40% tax, which applies to plans with yearly premiums exceeding $10,200 for individuals and $27,500 for families. 

Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers and a longtime Clinton supporter, praised the former secretary of state's decision. 

""We are proud that Hillary Clinton has come out in favor of a repeal of the so-called Cadillac tax -- a harmful tax on health benefits that is hurting America's working families,"" she said. ""This tax already is being used by employers to shift an increasing share of health care costs to employees."" 

But many health care experts who view the tax as a crucial part of the Obamacare law are critical of Clinton's position. 

""The smarter move is to leave well enough alone and allow this tax to take effect,"" said Jared Bernstein, a former White House economist and senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in a Washington Post op-ed earlier this year. ""After decades of fighting for it, we're finally moving towards a more rational, efficient health care system. Let's not screw that up.""",bd0a0113-608c-4b84-9963-a7627fa9bea2,News,2015-09-30T04:13:39Z,16 WAPT,Clinton: End Obamacare tax on top health plans,0.0,News

457,"(Bloomberg) -- European government bonds surged, pushing German five-year yields below zero for the first time in almost a month, as a slide in equity markets boosted demand for fixed- income assets. 

Benchmark German 10-year bunds led gains as European stocks fell the most in more than two weeks, underpinning the region’s benchmark sovereign securities. Speculation of extended stimulus from the European Central Bank increased after Executive Board member Peter Praet said on Monday that policy makers would “forcefully react” to defend their inflation objective. Since the ECB started its 1.1 trillion-euro ($1.2 trillion) bond- buying program in March, inflation in the currency bloc has slowed to a near standstill, compared with the ECB’s goal of just below 2 percent. 

The U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to refrain from increasing interest rates last week has bolstered the prospect of the ECB extending its “easy-monetary policy stance,” according to Rabobank International. 

“We are seeing softness in European equities and that provides a conducive backdrop for fixed income,” said Richard McGuire, head of European rates strategy at Rabobank in London. He added that “ongoing speculation of additional central-bank support in Europe and beyond, in the wake of the Fed’s steady rate decision, may be also playing a part here.” 

Germany’s five-year note yields declined five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to minus 0.015 percent at 3:15 p.m. London time. That’s the first time the yield has fallen below zero since Aug. 25. The 0.25 percent security due October 2020 climbed 0.285, or 2.85 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 101.34. The nation’s 10-year bund yield dropped eight basis points to 0.61 percent. 

Similar-maturity French bond yields fell seven basis points to 0.99 percent, and those on Italy’s declined five basis points to 1.76 percent. 

Dutch Auction 

The Netherlands sold 2.8 billion euros of three-year debt at a record-low yield. The Dutch State Treasury Agency allotted the notes due in April 2018 at an average yield of minus 0.156 percent, down from minus 0.032 percent at a previous auction on June 9. Yields on Dutch two-year notes fell to a record low of minus 0.246 percent. 

A negative yield means investors buying the securities now will get back less if they hold them until maturity than they paid. 

The primary focus for European bond markets will be economic data, according to Luca Cazzulani, senior fixed-income strategist at UniCredit SpA in Milan. 

“Right now we have to look at the data because that will tell you where the momentum is going,” Cazzulani said. “The ECB is saying they will intervene and do more if needed and that ultimately depends on the data.” 

Analysts said a report on Wednesday will show that a gauge of euro-area manufacturing growth slowed this month. Markit Economics’ Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 52 from 52.3 in August, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. That would be the lowest reading since April.",f71b89ee-ebbc-4da9-a245-dd3a6dbcadf8,News,2015-09-22T14:47:33Z,La Repubblica,Germany’s Five-Year Yields Drop Below Zero as Equities Tumble,0.0,News
3976,"( www.bloomberg.com ) 
 
Apple Inc. won a court ruling that may force Samsung Electronics Co. to stop using some features in its older-model Galaxy smartphones and tablets and gives the iPhone maker a leg up in the four-year-old dispute. 
 
A U.S. appeals court said Apple was entitled to a narrow order that prevents the Korean device maker from using Apple’s slide-to-unlock, autocorrect and quicklinks features. Ruling otherwise would eliminate patent rights of inventors of certain features in multicomponent devices, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington said in an opinion posted on its electronic docket. 
 
The decision could have far-reaching consequences in how disputes are resolved when it comes to complex devices, and help patent owners limit copying by rivals. The ability to block use of an invention is a powerful tool that increases the price tag when negotiating settlements. 
 
“It’s an important precedent for Apple and any company that seeks to protect product differentiation,” said Nick Rodelli, who heads CFRA Legal Edge, a New York-based forensic accounting and legal research firm. “This broadens their moat here in the U.S. and makes it more difficult for new entrants to come into the U.S. market and rip off Apple’s features.” 
 
Samsung said it would ask that the issue be considered by all active judges of the Federal Circuit, since it was a split decision. The court handles all patent appeals. 
 
Older Models 
 
The iPhone maker gains additional firepower with its biggest rival when it comes to resolving a fight that began in April 2011. A past Apple settlement with HTC Corp. included a “no cloning” provision that ensured HTC’s phones didn’t look too similar to the iPhone, and the ruling Thursday helps do the same to other makers, like China’s Xiaomi Corp., that want to enter the U.S. market. 
 
For Samsung, the ruling applies to older models including the Galaxy S2 and Note 2 that have been superseded by current devices such as the S6. It is thus unlikely to have a significant impact on the company’s business, said Lee Jae Yun, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Korea Co. 
 
Samsung’s shares climbed 2.9 percent to 1,190,000 million won in Seoul on Friday, while the benchmark Kospi index rose 1 percent. 
 
“The remaining litigation looks rather symbolic and I don’t expect the court rulings on older models would have a significant impact on Samsung’s business,” said Jeong Woo Sung, a patent lawyer at Lim & Jeong Patent Law Firm in Seoul. 
 
Trial Verdict 
 
Apple won a $119.6 million jury verdict in May 2014 against Samsung, which was found to have infringed its patents for the slide-to-unlock, autocorrect and quicklinks features. Even so, the trial judge declined to force Samsung to remove them from its mobile phones, saying monetary damages would be adequate. 
 
Apple argued that, if it weren’t able to control use of its inventions, it may lose market share and its reputation as an innovator. 
 
“The right to exclude competitors from using one’s property rights is important,” the Federal Circuit ruled in a 2-1 decision. “And the right to maintain exclusivity — a hallmark and crucial guarantee of patent rights deriving from the Constitution itself -— is likewise important.” 
 
Samsung Backers 
 
Google Inc., HTC, LG Electronics Inc. and Rackspace Hosting Inc. were among companies backing Samsung in its arguments. They argued that a victory for Apple could allow a patent owner “to unfairly leverage its patent for competitive gain.” 
 
The specific features had some impact on customer decisions to buy products, and that should be considered when determining whether to block use of an invention, the court said. In her dissent, Chief Judge Sharon Prost said Apple must show that the features drove sales from Apple to Samsung before it could block a product. 
 
Samsung told the appeals court in March that none of its current models use two of the patents, and only a single product still has the autolink feature, so it will undergo no hardship, the court ruled. 
 
“We want to reassure our millions of loyal customers that all of our flagship smartphones, which are wanted and loved by American consumers, will remain for sale and available for customer service support in the U.S.,” said Danielle Meister Cohen, a Samsung spokeswoman. 
 
She said Samsung has its own history of innovation. 
 
Newer Versions 
 
Apple can go back and argue to the trial judge that Samsung’s newer versions still infringe the patents, setting up yet more legal debates between the two. 
 
“The public generally does not benefit when that competition comes at the expense of a patentee’s investment-backed property right,” Circuit Judge Kimberly Moore wrote for the majority. “This is not a case where the public would be deprived of Samsung’s products. Apple does not seek to enjoin the sale of lifesaving drugs, but to prevent Samsung from profiting from the unauthorized use of infringing features in its cellphones and tablets.” 
 
Samsung is appealing the underlying infringement verdict as well; that case is pending before the Federal Circuit. 
 
Apple won an earlier case against Samsung over the design of the iPhone which it said was copied. The Federal Circuit in May upheld $548 million worth of damages in that case. A partial trial must be held to determine the exact amount. In a Sept. 11 filing with the court in San Francisco, both sides said they were willing to work with a mediator to resolve the case, with Apple going so far as to suggest binding arbitration. 
 
The case ruled on today is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Inc., 14-1802, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The lower court case is Apple v. Samsung, 12cv630, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (San Jose).",f949e480-4792-41f7-8e74-516150d90055,Blog,2015-09-18T10:07:37Z,Bubba the Love Sponge® Show,"Apple Wins Ruling to Force Samsung to Change Phones, Tablets",1.0,News

1129,"Despite the high frizz potential that had many actresses slicking back their hair at the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards on Sunday, several were brave enough to wear their hair down, inspired by looks from Old Hollywood.
The traditional Veronica Lake deep side part and flowing finger waves looked pretty and, surprisingly, didn’t show the faintest sign of heat induced fly-aways.
Emma Roberts, January Jones, Maisie Williams, Allison Janney, Natasha Lyonne and Elisabeth Moss (who worked the deep side part to show sparkling diamond earrings from Beladora estate jewelry) all had Old Hollywood hair, which felt right for the intermediate level of formality of the Emmys.
“We did a modern take on an Old Hollywood sultry star,” says Nikki Lee of Nine Zero One salon, who created Roberts' look.
FULL COVERAGE: Emmys 2015
She prepped the actress’ hair with Unite 7 Seconds Leave in Detangler and then sprayed Unite Boosta Spray at the root to mid-shaft for volume. See the most-read stories this hour Open link “I used a blow and set lotion for her ends, blowing her out with a 2-inch round brush, adding a nice bounce to her hair,” says Lee. “After I blew her out, I set her hair by spraying 7 Seconds Glossing Dry Thermal Shine to protect her hair from the heat of the 1 1/2-inch curling iron I used.”
True to how it was actually done during the Old Hollywood era, Lee coiled 2-inch sections of the hair and pinned them with a duckbill clip to hold them in place. After 15 minutes, Lee took the hair down from the clips and brushed out the curls with a boar bristled brush, then sprayed a mist of hairspray over the head to lock in the look and keep down frizz. 67th Primetime Emmy Awards - Show Kevin Winter / Getty Images Actresses Jamie Lee Curtis, left, and Emma Roberts appear onstage during the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards.

1614,"Brian Love, 42, of Riverdale, Georgia, is scheduled to go on trial next month on murder and weapons charges in the stabbing death of Denise Ramsey, who was found on Jan. 25, 2012 in East Orange. Essex County Correctional Facility    
NEWARK  -- With his co-defendant still at large, a Georgia man is scheduled to go on trial next month on charges of stabbing a ""go-go"" dancer to death and leaving her body in an empty lot in East Orange. 

Brian Love, 42, of Riverdale, Georgia, is facing murder and weapons charges in the killing of Denise Ramsey, who was discovered under a mattress on Jan. 25, 2012 after her sister had reported her missing. 
 
Love is set to return to court on Oct. 16 for a status hearing, and jury selection in the trial is scheduled to begin on Oct. 19. 
 
His co-defendant, Johnny Jones III, is also charged in Ramsey's murder, but he remains a fugitive, according to Katherine Carter, spokeswoman for the Essex County Prosecutor's Office. 
 
Love remains in custody at the Essex County Correctional Facility in lieu of $1 million bail. 
 RELATED:  Man says he missed son's birth after false arrest in murder of 'go-go' dancer 

The upcoming trial comes as another Georgia resident, Corey Fallen, pursues a federal lawsuit over the case, claiming he was falsely arrested and unlawfully imprisoned in connection with Ramsey's murder . 
 
Witnesses had identified Fallen as being with Ramsey when she went missing in December 2011, but his DNA was not found on her body and detectives ultimately confirmed that Fallen was not in New Jersey at the time of Ramsey's disappearance, court documents state. 
 
Fallen spent nearly six months in custody, before he was released on his own recognizance in April 2013. About a month later, an Essex County grand jury decided to not indict Fallen in Ramsey's death. 
 
In May 2014, Love and Jones were indicted in the murder. 
 
Authorities have said Ramsey, 33, was last seen in the early morning hours of Dec. 3, 2011, when she was working at the Doll House in Irvington. 
 
At the time, two male suspects at the club became angry when they gave Ramsey three one-hundred-dollar bills and asked her for change in the form of singles, but then only received change for one hundred-dollar bill, according to eyewitnesses, court documents state. 
 
The witnesses recalled one of the suspects saying, ""if we don't get the money, then we gonna go outside, pop the trunk and kill everybody in here,"" court documents state. Ramsey was last seen by witnesses leaving the Doll House that evening and getting into a vehicle with the male suspects, court documents state. 
 
At a hearing for Love on Tuesday, Essex County Assistant Prosecutor Naazneen Khan indicated that Jones and Love were the male suspects with Ramsey on the night of her disappearance. 
 
Investigators later found Love's DNA under Ramsey's fingernails, Khan said. Jones's DNA was linked to DNA found in a sweatshirt that was wrapped around Ramsey's body and DNA found under Ramsey's fingernails, according to court documents. 
 
During Tuesday's hearing, Khan also said that, after detectives arrested Love in Atlanta, he gave a statement in which ""he indicates his presence at the scene at the time that the victim is being stabbed to death and indicates that he did assist in disposing of the victim's body,"" according to an audio recording of the proceeding. 
 
The empty lot where Ramsey was discovered is less than a mile from where Jones and Love were residing at the time, Khan said. 
 
Essex County prosecutors have offered a plea deal to Love in which they would recommend a sentence of seven years in state prison. Under that offer, Love would have to serve nearly six years before becoming eligible for parole. 
 
Love's attorney, Olubukola Adetula, indicated on Tuesday that he has been looking for a plea deal that includes a seven-year prison sentence with no period of parole ineligibility. 
 
But when Superior Court Judge Ronald Wigler questioned Love on Tuesday about whether he wanted to proceed to trial, Love said he had not decided yet, according to the audio recording. 
 
Wigler then asked Love if he had an opportunity to speak with Adetula, but Adetula interjected, saying he had discussed the matter with Love and that he ""fully understands what the state's position is."" 
 
""I think he's very clear on that and, if anything changes, of course, I will notify the court and the prosecutor, but for now, we're where we are,"" Adetula said. 
 
The judge said he wanted to avoid having the case resolved on the ""eve of trial if it doesn't have to be,"" and asked Adetula whether it would be beneficial to return to court in September to ensure Love has ""everything he needs to make that informed and intelligent decision."" 
 
But Adetula said such a court hearing was not necessary, saying he will make sure Love has everything he needs and that he will continue to have discussions with Love. If anything changes, Adetula said he will notify the court.

1563,"Nigeria has begun upgrading her aviation infrastructure to showcase the country’s rising profile as Africa’s economic powerhouse. With a $500 million loan from the Export and Import Bank of China, five airport terminals at its principal aviation hubs are under construction by the China Civil Engineering Construction Company. Despite the promise which the project holds for commercial flights in Nigeria’s dominant economic centres, uncertainty still surrounds the immediate completion and future sustainability of these airport terminals. reports. 
 
It’s the wet season in Nigeria, a slow period for construction work owing to the onset of heavy rains. As expected, the giant cranes above the new terminal building under construction at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos seem to have stopped moving — at least temporarily. 
 
Although the signage at the entrance to the project site proudly announces the client as the Federal Ministry of Aviation/Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, not much comings and goings can be seen of the contractor, the China Civil Engineering Construction Company (CCECC). Passers-by and passengers alike may assume the halt in construction is due to the monsoon weather but lack of finance has been pointed to as the culprit behind the delay. How can the clientsuddenly run out of cash? 
 
“Fraud! The money has been removed…over 70% of that money has been removed by the previous minister of aviation. Where is the money to complete the project? 
 
Alhaji Mohammed Tukur, an aviation analyst and former managing director of Chanchangi Airlines, responded when I spoke to him on the telephone. “Call the contractors—ask them what is going on—they will tell you. It’s just (the Nigerian face of) corruption.” 
 
All efforts to obtain information from the contractor, China Civil Engineering Construction Company in the course of this investigation proved abortive. 
 
Nigeria has a long history of public funds mismanagement and diversion of foreign loans to private pockets or sometimes, toward totally unrelated government expenditures — away from the original purposes for which such credit were obtained in the first place. 
 
For example, the Federal Ministry of Finance was recently queried by President Muhammadu Buhari on the alleged diversion of a $1 billion loan that was secured from China by the last administration for the construction of the Lagos-Kano railway project. Still, the Chinese government is more than willing to extend credit to Nigeria without any sort of probity in the utilisation of these funds — an offshoot of China’s policy of non-interference in the domestic affairs of sovereign states. 
 
The $500 million loan for the five airport terminals is part of a bigger $1.1 billion credit facility obtained from the Export and Import Bank of China for the building of critical infrastructure that includes the Abuja Light Rail and the Galaxy Backbone ICT projects. Both Chinese-funded aviation and rail projects are being executed by CCECC, a symbol of Beijing’s growing influence in Africa. 
 
This strategic policy of the Chinese government—giving with one hand and taking back with the other, undermines the competitiveness of Nigeria’s construction firms and outsources domestic jobs to Chinese expatriates. The decision to award the contract to CCECC, a foreign company that had until the 2000s played no role in the construction of public infrastructure in Nigeria begs for an independent inquiry. 
 
A press release issued by the Finance Ministry on its website states that the facility was obtained on highly favourable concessional terms: 2.5 per cent interest over 20 years with a grace period of seven years. Captain Dele Ore, president of the Aviation Roundtable and former pilot and manager of defunct Nigeria Airways, disapproves Nigeria’s decision to obtain credit from China to finance capital projects. 
 
“A decision like that to take a loan to expand airport infrastructure is a tonne of debt that will be hanging on the neck of our children for generations to come. Normally when you want to develop infrastructure, invite investors…and there are so many ways of doing it. Besides not being transparent, I think it was not a very good decision. They are getting more and more debt for people yet unborn.” 
 
A few kilometres from the international terminal under construction by CCECC, is the domestic terminal of Lagos airport, commonly referred to as ‘MMA2’. Through a concession agreement between Bi-Courtney Aviation Services Ltd and the Federal Government of Nigeria, the facility was commissioned in 2007. The concession entrusted the development and management of the terminal to Bi-Courtney, a leading Nigerian airport operator, for a maximum period of 25 years after which the ownership of the facility will be transferred to the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria. This Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model transformed the domestic terminal of Lagos airport into the best of its kind in Nigeria, providing a model for similar projects in the future. 
 
Why can’t the federal government use this successful PPP approach to develop and operate the international terminals across Nigeria? 
 
“In determining long-term sustainability of concessions over development loans or vice-versa, a number of factors have to be considered,” Abiodun Keripe, head of research at Lagos-based Elixir Investment Partners explains in an email. “Firstly, financing and cash-flows. Management and profitability of the project is also another factor to be considered. The financial status of our international airports and the need to upgrade and expand airport capacity clearly does not give much room for other [financing] alternatives. As with many capital-intensive projects, debt financing is one of the viable sources of financing as long as the cost of borrowing (interest rate) and the tenor (duration) is favourable to allow for a good gestation period of the project.” 
 
For a megacity of 12 million people and an economy of about $90 billion which dwarfs that of several West African countries combined, the scale of the international terminal being built at Lagos airport is unimpressive. In this decade and the coming ones, Lagos is poised to play the role which great cities such as Tokyo and Seoul played in the development of their respective countries in the last century. The metropolis needs world-class infrastructure to perform this role effectively. 
 
Why do we even need to build five international terminals when we can focus on one or two whose capacity and standard can rival that of the best airports in the world? For instance, the airport in Port Harcourt is currently being served by four foreign airlines, two of which operate on regional routes yet a brand new terminal is being built for it. 
 
Apart from the international terminal at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos, the other international terminals under construction are in Abuja, Enugu, Kano and Port Harcourt. The Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport in Abuja is projected to serve 16 million passengers annually, up from its current capacity of 5 million. The remaining three terminals: Akanu Ibiam International Airport in Enugu, Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport in Kano and the Port Harcourt International Airport will serve 7 million passengers each upon completion. With a capacity for 25 million passengers per annum from the current 7 million passengers it presently serves, the international airport in Lagos will retain the lion’s share of the projected capacity of 62 million passengers for the nation’s new aviation hubs. 
 
Presently, there are no direct flights between China and Nigeria. Most intending travellers to China from Nigeria and vice-versa still have to connect flights at regional aviation hubs in Addis Ababa and Nairobi or via the mega-hubs of the two biggest Gulf carriers — Qatar Airways and Emirates Airlines. 
 
Since the dissolution of Nigeria Airways in 2004 after decades of loss making due to mismanagement, successive administrations have tried with varying degree of mixed results to float a national carrier. Now, there is renewed interest by the current administration to float another national airliner. But the lack of critical infrastructure will certainly hamper such plans. Alhaji Tukur dismisses the idea. “A national carrier is an old-fashioned idea! Do we have a terminal like Dubai? Do we have a terminal like Heathrow?” 
 
Another aviation consultant and industry veteran, Chris Aligbe, faults the scale of the international terminals. “$500million is too small to develop a good terminal. Terminals take up to $1 billion.” 
 
Speaking further on China’s capacity to develop our aviation sector, he said, “China doesn’t have a pedigree in airline management. Do you know of any world-class Chinese airline? You don’t invite people who don’t have a pedigree to come and help you — they will only lead you with the extent of the knowledge they have which will lead you nowhere.” 
 
The recent update by Binta Bello, the permanent secretary of the Federal Ministry of Aviation, on the current halt in the construction of the airport terminals confirms that the delay in completion is due to shortage of funds. Nonetheless, the new completion date has been shifted to the first quarter of 2016. Between now and then, the new administration still needs to probe how the loans were disbursed and utilised. 
 
Ideally, this period should also be used to determine how the terminals will be managed upon their completion since the absence of a maintenance culture over the past decades led to the dereliction of the current terminals. Perhaps the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria should enter into another agreement with CCECC on the future management of the terminal buildings. 
 
It is important that we create a holistic strategy for attracting foreign investors, especially from the private sector, to develop and manage Nigeria’s crumbling aviation infrastructure. Granted, we may also have to source for credit from abroad. Nonetheless, the knowledge of our home-grown experts is essential for transforming our airports into premier facilities that meets the demands of international travellers for business or leisure. 
 
Tajudeen Folarin, a Nigerian passenger commented: “We hope when the new [terminal] is ready for use, it will be properly managed. This airport used to be among the best in the world but look at it now. In fact, it used to be worse, but some renovation work was done by the last government. All they need to do is to maintain the new one well and travellers won’t have to suffer like we now do.”

They have been through this conversation almost a dozen times. Now he was really tired of this relationship. It’s been 2 years. He had tried a lot to make it work. He has sacrificed a lot. He has crossed all his limits. And he loved her more than anything. A boy loves with all his heart. A girl loves with her brain. A boy will love the girl without knowing her, her family, her tastes, her likes, her dislikes and then try to fit into her image of a good boyfriend/husband. A girl also starts to love without knowing anything, but then rest of the relationship she tries to modify or reshape the boys interest, his style, his likes, his dislike, his passions and even his way of thinking. For a boy it’s, “if you are with me I’ll do anything for you”. But for a girl it’s “if you do this, this and this, for me than I will ‘think’ about you”. A boy will convince his family, his friends and relatives for her. But a girl will not do the same and instead say, how can I. A girl needs a secure future, a stable monthly income, a good house, a good car, a high-profile school for her children. And that too when she is 23 and the boy is 24. She won’t allow the boy some time to earn and settle down. She wants it now and once for all. “Ok”, he said and went up to the billing corner, paid off the bill and left her sitting alone. She knew he will call him after an hour and apologize and say “baby, give me some time, I know it’s my fault, I am looking for a better job and will soon be earning good. And I have talked with my dad we will soon be selling off the land in village and build a home in town, and baby I know you are doing this for us. You just stay with me I’ll do whatever you say.” …………… And the chutzpa (foolishness) continues until she eventually will stop receiving his calls and settle down with a wealthy, good guy. ©fidoic",4a58fe6d-57ca-4191-bfa7-e1dbf7db65c8,Blog,2015-09-23T08:23:13Z,Some Serious Stuff!,Girls Vs Boys Reaction to a Breakup.,1.0,News

2412,"The number of rail journeys made each year has more than doubled since privatisation, according to a new report. 
 
		 
Some 1.65 billion passenger train journeys were taken in the past 12 months compared to 801 million in 1997. 
  A total of 1.65 billion passenger train journeys were taken in the past 12 months, figures show   
The figures come from analysis by the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) -  which represents operators and Network  Rail - based on  data from KPMG. 

			 
The study found 24.7 rail trips are taken per head of population each year, a 60% increase from 1998. 



 
This growth in journeys in the UK is faster than in France (25%), Germany (23%) and the Netherlands (10%) over the same period. 

The RDG found income from passengers covers the £9.5 billion annual operating cost of the railways, with government support being used to fund infrastructure. 

According to the report, the average price paid per passenger mile has increased by 6.7% (adjusted for inflation) since the mid-90s. 

Meanwhile, the profit made by operators has fallen from 3.6% of revenue in 1997 to 2.3% last year. 

			 
The study also found that the country's busiest rail termini - London's Waterloo and Victoria - have more arrivals per platform in the morning peak than European stations such as the Gare du Nord in Paris, Zurich and Frankfurt. 

Edward Welsh, spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, said the rail network is better able to serve passengers and businesses because of its transformation over the past two decades into "" a great British success story"". 

He went on: ""Crucial to this success has been the partnership between the private and public sectors, working together to deliver better value to passengers, freight customers and the nation. 

""There is much more we need to do to improve services for our customers. Our greatest challenge is to plan and build for the ever growing demand for rail by increasing capacity cost effectively and generating revenue to support investment in more and better services.""

109,"We've got tips, tours and deals. 

The dollar may be down, but that doesn't mean packing away the passport permanently. In fact, New research, Expedia Value Tracker, reveals the best value spots for a Christmas trip overseas, and even the US figures as a possibility. That's because currency fluctuations are not the only monetary movement to factor in. Changes in accommodation, flight and living costs all contribute to the value of a holiday.

For instance, New Zealand is the only destination where the Australian dollar currently goes further than it did a year ago, up four per cent year-on-year. But the average accommodation cost there has risen nine per cent, while average flight prices between NZ and Australia have decreased five per cent. That all adds up to Expedia considering New Zealand the best value option for Aussies right now.

As for the US, the fact that flight costs have dipped 10 per cent in the past year offsets the dollar drop of 21 per cent and counting – a little. Expedia says travellers might find better value across the border in Canada this year, where the Australian dollar has only fallen six per cent against the Canadian dollar and flights decreased by six per cent year-on-year. That's especially relevant for those considering a Christmas ski break.

Expedia Australia and NZ managing director MD George Ruebensal suggests, however, you think creatively. ""If travellers are flexible about where they go, there are opportunities to save. And when thinking about Europe, that's exciting as there are so many amazing places to explore. For instance, why not consider Norway where the Aussie dollar has gained ground against the Norwegian krone and average hotel and flight prices have also decreased.""

The Aussie has also gained more than 30 per cent against the Russian ruble.

5665,"About a month ago, we wrote about the Universal Life cost increase occurring at Transamerica and Legal & General (Notice to TOLI Trustees: Universal Life Costs ARE on the Rise). Since then, AXA has announced cost of insurance increases beginning on the next anniversary date of some of its US Financial Life policies.

Though the cost increases are not occurring on all of the policies in the Transamerica portfolio, we do manage a number of policies affected by these changes, and thought we would take some time to show how the cost increases affect policy performance. While this blog will focus on Transamerica, future blogs will take a look under the hood at other carriers’ policies.
First, a little background: The Universal Life (UL) chassis is actually pretty simple to understand. As you can see in the drawing to the right, there are not that many moving parts. The premiums contributed become part of the cash value (typically after a sales charge is deducted), and the cash value grows tax-deferred based on some investment return, depending on the type of UL policy. The policy we are reviewing today is a current assumption UL policy, and the cash value is invested primarily in fixed investments. Credited rates for these policies have dropped over the years. Each month, the carrier deducts charges from the policy. These monthly deductions are taken out on the same date each month.
The largest component of the monthly deduction is typically the cost of insurance (COI), which increases each year as the insured ages. As we mentioned in our earlier blog, the increases to the Transamerica policy are on top of the naturally occurring annual cost increases.

The monthly COI is computed by the carrier by multiplying the cost per thousand dollars of coverage by the net amount at risk, which is defined as the difference between the death benefit and the cash value. Remember, with a level death benefit policy, the carrier keeps the cash value at death.
Net Amount at Risk = Death Benefit Minus Cash Value
So, for example, if we had a $100,000 death benefit policy with $50,000 of cash value and the monthly COI was $1 per thousand, the monthly COI would be $50.
$100,000 minus $50,000 equals $50,000 net amount at risk
$50,000 times $1/thousand equals $50 monthly COI
The policy that we are reviewing today is a $4,000,000 Transamerica level death benefit current assumption UL policy. The insured, a male, was 52 at policy issue. At issue, he was given standard non-smoker underwriting. The policy is a flexible premium product, and to date, the trustee has paid $1,342,887 into the policy. The policy contract states that the full death benefit will be paid “if the insured dies before the policy anniversary date nearest the insured’s age 100.” However, if the insured is still alive on that date, the policy will pay only the “net cash value to the owner.”

At the current time the policy has a net cash value of $1,944,502.

Since the policy anniversary date has just passed, we had a fresh policy review in our files with illustrations from May of this year. We contrasted those with illustrations obtained last month, just three months later, with the higher rates.

As you can see in the spreadsheet to the right, the monthly deductions jumped approximately 40%. Carriers have a guaranteed COI that is listed in the policy contract. In all letters to policyholders, Transamerica emphasized that its new rates would be less than what is guaranteed in the policy, and that is true. The new costs in the policy are approximately 65-70% of the guaranteed costs. Hopefully, that does not mean we will see additional cost increases in the future.

So, how does the cost increase affect the performance of the policy going forward? Remember that this is a cash-rich policy, which lowers the net amount at risk. Because the policy is so cash-rich, it could persist for a period of time with no additional premium. In the May illustrations, the policy was shown to persist until the insured was age 94 with no additional funding. The cost increase cuts 5 years off of that projection; the policy now only carries to age 89 with no additional premium.

Obviously, the insured could live past age 89 (5% of the insureds in our portfolio are over age 90.) If the insured were still alive at age 89, an increasing annual premium starting at $44,831 at age 90, jumping to $597,995 at age 91, and increasing each year thereafter would be needed to have the policy run to age 100. In fact, the total premium needed from point of lapse at age 89 until age 100 would be $9,721,947, well over the death benefit provided by the policy. And remember, that just carries the policy to age 100, when only the cash value, which will be minimal, will be paid. It does not pay to grow old with this policy.

Another alternative would be to pay a level annual premium starting this year to carry the policy to age 100. In May, that level premium was $36,400. With the higher costs, the level annual premium more than doubles to $81,595.
There are other options. You could surrender the policy, and since the cash value is greater than the premium paid, a taxable event would occur. Transamerica does point out other alternatives in its letter to policyholders. For example, you could reduce the death benefit down to an amount that would allow the policy to carry to age 100 with no additional premium, assuming these new costs. That death benefit amount would be $3,110,000, but of course if costs go up again, the policy could still lapse prior to age 100. In order to ensure that does not happen, you could obtain a reduced paid-up policy that would be contractually guaranteed. If you accepted that offer, you would receive a death benefit of $2,834,222.
So, to recap, you could:

	Surrender the policy for the current cash value, creating a taxable event.
	Pay no premium, and if the insured is still alive at age 89, continue the policy to age 100 by paying an increasing annual premium.
	Pay a level premium of $81,595 each year to get the policy to age 100, if costs do not go up again.
	Accept a lower death benefit amount of approximately $3.1M and with no additional premium the policy would run to age 100, if costs do not go up again.
	Accept a contractually guaranteed death benefit of approximately $2.8M.
	Search the marketplace for a new policy, if the insured is still able to obtain coverage.

So what would you do if you were the Trustee? On October 20th at 2PM Eastern, we have scheduled a webinar designed to review the UL cost increases in general and specific case studies in particular. We are going to outline the steps you should take when analyzing a policy to ensure that you can document a prudent process was followed. And we will walk through all of the options in detail, including whether or not to “endow” the policy to ensure a full benefit is paid if the insured lives to age 100. The session has been approved for one hour of continuing education credit for both CFP® and CTFA® designations.  

We will be following up on this topic in future blogs.

It's been almost exactly one year since Kirk Cousins became the starter of the Washington Redskins for the 2nd time following Robert Griffin III's ankle injury Week 2 vs the Titans.  The fine folks at BreakingT created the Kirk Cousins the First(KC1) t-shirt to show support for the team's new starting QB, and we even gave a few of them away in a caption contest for this classic Cousins gif:


    





Cousins has once again been named the starter for the Washington Redskins and BreakingT has brought the KC1 shirt back! Robert Griffin III suffered a concussion in Week 2 of the preseason vs the Detroit Lions, and Captain Kirk took over the team the following week.  Head Coach Jay Gruden named him the starting QB, not only for Week 1 against the Miami Dolphins, but for the entire season, saying Kirk made the decision easy with his play.  Is it finally Cousins chance to take over the team, and show that he is a starting-caliber QB in the NFL?  He will be given that shot again this season to prove it.  Now it's time for everyone to support the Washington Redskins starting QB the same way that Tom Compton did above...

Kevin and Michael Price, 24, both of Gibbon Lane, Thorne in Doncaster and Catherine Price, 32, of Westerton Road, Tingley, appeared at Wakefield Magistrates’ Court today. 

Ms Price faced a further charge of possession of an offensive weapon - a machete, and Kevin faced a charge of possessing an imitation firearm - a sawn-off shotgun. 

			 
Richard Ogden, prosecuting, said the case was “not suitable” to be heard at Magistrates’ Court as it involved “weapons which could have caused serious injury”. 



 
Magistrates agreed the case would be transferred to Leeds Crown Court, where all three defendants will next appear on October 12. 

Martin Lord represented the brothers while mum-of-six Ms Price was represented by Damien Walsh. 

Chief magistrate Margaret Bradley granted the siblings bail. 

But Mr Ogden appealed the decision. 

			 
The trio have been remanded in custody until the outcome of their bail hearing later this week.

899,"MUMS, dads and children at locations across the Sunshine Coast set off on a walk with one common mission: to bring William Tyrrell home. 
 
Similar events were also held across Australia at the same time, 10.30am yesterday. 
 
Exactly a year earlier, three-year-old boy William Tyrrell (pictured) was taken from his grandmother's home in Kendall, on the New South Wales mid-north coast. 
 
While there have been reports of sightings, the little boy, who disappeared wearing his favourite Spiderman costume, has not yet been found. He would now be four. 
 
A group of Coolum locals organised their own Walk for William, starting at Tickle Park and walking along the beachside cliffs to Point Perry. 
 
Despite the grey weather at least 150 walkers participated yesterday. 
  Christina and Riley Clifford.   
Walkers wore red and blue in recognition of William's favourite superhero, and many kids - as well as organiser Angela Gray - donned full-length Spiderman suits. 
 
Ms Gray said the Walk for William idea was intended to ""make the community take note"". 
 
""We will not sweep him under the carpet,"" she said to the crowd. 
 
""We will keep onto this until he is brought home or until somebody is brought to justice. 
 
""He is a little boy, like all of the kids here. He should be at home with his parents. 
 
""Ours is a simple one in Coolum but it is in respect for William."" 
   
Organiser Angie Dunbavan said she hoped the various walks would jog someone's memory about the disappearance, or compel those with information to come forward. 
 
She said it also represented a chance for parents to start a conversation about safety with their children. 
 
""It's a really good opportunity to raise community awareness around stranger danger,"" she said. 
 
""About how to protect yourself as a child, and what parents can do to be more vigilant."" 
 
Yaroomba mum Christina Clifford attended the event with her son Riley, who turned three last week, the same age William was when he disappeared. 
 
Mrs Clifford said William's disappearance had hit her ""straight to the heart"". 
 
""I just cried and cried,"" she said. 
 
""Australia should be a safe environment to just let kids be kids, and taking advantage of a little three-year-old, it makes me sick in my guts, basically."" 
 
She said she was trying to talk to Riley about William during the walk. 
 
""I'm trying now to explain to him what we're doing here, but it's not easy to explain to a three-year-old,"" she said. 
 
""He keeps saying 'where is William, we have to try and find William'.""",c08a7181-e540-4bb4-b54d-24c68ffaf533,News,2015-09-12T20:10:20Z,Fraser Coast Chronicle,Stepping out to bring young William Tyrrell home,0.0,News

164,"On Monday’s edition of NewsOne Now, Roland Martin posed a question about the upcoming presidential election and one of the largest movements in recent history: “Should the Black Lives Matter movement invite Republican and Democratic presidential candidates to a debate/forum in an attempt to force them to address issues important to the African-American community?” There would be pros and cons behind holding the forum, NewsOne Now panelist Paris Dennard told Martin: “It would be very telling to those candidates who take this seriously and who may not agree with the slogan or the hashtag, but understand there are pros behind it.” He added, “Those who get it and have staff that say ‘This is something that you should do, if you want to reach and have these inroads and tap into how America feels’ will show up. Those that won’t, they’re not going to be there.” Lauren Victoria Burke, Managing Editor of Politic365.com, said, “I think we know who would not show up.” “Most of the Republicans would not show up.” She continued, “Jeb Bush, maybe Marco Rubio would show up.” Martin then interjected with Bush’s “free stuff” faux pas from last week, to which Burke said, “That is how they market to Black voters — the welfare queen.” Later, Martin suggested the forum would raise the Black Lives Matter movement to a different level. “Because if you go back to 2012, when you have the Tea Party that sponsored debates — Black Lives Matter movement should do it as well,” Martin said. Martin believes a Black Lives Matter-sponsored presidential debate would “force every Democratic candidate to have to show up and speak to our issues.” Watch Roland Martin, GOP strategist Paris Dennard, and Lauren Victoria Burke discuss the notion of the Black Lives Matter Movement hosting/sponsoring a 2016 presidential candidate debate/forum in the video clip above.

2953,"It has recently been brought to my attention that I may have an ‘obsession’, with ‘breathing’ and ‘movement’. I originally thought that ‘obsession’ was a bit strong of a descriptor but after thinking about it in a bit more depth, I may be guilty of being a bit obsessed. 
 

 
Breathing is one of the key principles of Pilates (and many other disciplines as well I must add) and I am sure you would have heard some reference to it at some point in your Pilates experience. 
 
Ever wonder why most relaxation techniques involve focus on the breath? From a physiological perspective, a simplified explanation is through the relationship between our breath and arousal level. When we are stressed, scared, anxious or angry the ‘fight or flight’ system is triggered in our bodies. This is controlled by our sympathetic nervous system and some key responses are shallow rapid breathing, increased heart rate and blood being diverted to our big power muscles. On the contrary our ‘relaxed’ or basal state is controlled by our parasympathetic nervous system, which has the opposite response; longer slower breaths, decreased heart rate and blood/ energy directed to more basal functions such as digestion or immunity. 
 
You may be thinking, “Well since I am exercising doing Pilates don’t I want to have more of my energy to my big power muscles?” My answer to that would be it depends what your goal is. If you are trying to generate power, sure, a strong powerful exhalation can be more beneficial (there are many opinions on breathing techniques for maximizing power but I am not going to go into that debate). However, Pilates training and exercise requires a focus more on ‘control’ than power. Through my experience, I have found that in this day and age most of us are normally in a slight state of over arousal and find it difficult to ‘relax’ and therefore breathe long relaxed breaths. Our movement reflects this. We are good at fast and powerful but find hard to slow down and control. 
 
Check out for an experienced and Reliable women’s health physiotherapy in Brisbane 
 
In reality not one form of breath or movement is better than the other; it is just more efficient and effective when we use them appropriately. 
 
Some breathing tips: 
 
* The breath should match the movement. I.e. Long fluid movements require long fluid breaths 
* Exhaling during the most challenging aspect of the movement is often easiest 
* To increase range or stretch allow for a FULL exhalation 
* Although breath can be a very powerful tool to improve your practice/ performance, it can be confusing and therefore hinder performance when you are first learning a new exercise or technique. If this is the case don’t worry about the specifics and just BREATHE.

2881,"As if the rash of shootings along a busy stretch of Interstate-10 in downtown Phoenix wasn't bad enough, authorities now may have a copycat on their hands. 
 
That's a real possibility after two additional shootings -- not on I-10 but along roadways elsewhere in the Arizona capital -- late Thursday morning. A source with direct knowledge of the investigation said this may be someone trying to emulate the earlier shootings. 

For now, though, police are investigating the latest incidents as separate shootings, having not definitively linked them to the earlier cases. Arizona State Troopers spokesman Tim Case said Thursday afternoon there have been 11 confirmed shootings in and around I-10 in less than two weeks, not including what he called ""numerous reports this morning of other vehicles with damage."" 

""This has not been confirmed to be part of this investigation,"" Case said of the new cases. 

Arizona's Department of Public Safety chief hasn't yet called this the case of a serial sniper, which could imply someone staking out a perch to selectively target people. Nor have authorities given any indication that they have a suspect in mind. 

But Col. Frank Milstead, the DPS director, has called tracking down the person responsible ""job one,"" a sentiment echoed Thursday by Arizona's governor. 

""This is our top priority in our administration,"" Gov. Doug Ducey said. ""I'd ask Arizonans to remain alert and aware. And we're going to find who's doing this and bring them to justice."" 

New round of shootings after break 

The first shootings were reported on August 29, when bullets hit three vehicles -- an SUV, an empty commercial tour bus and a passenger car -- as they traveled along I-10. 

There were two more shootings over the subsequent two days, then a break until the shootings apparently resumed on Sunday. Since then, there have been two box trucks, two pickups, a passenger car and a tractor trailer -- the latest incident Thursday morning -- struck. 

Milstead said then that some of the motorists didn't immediately realize their cars had been shot, thinking the loud noise they heard was an object on the highway that hit their vehicle. 

Bullets struck seven of the vehicles, according to the Case. The others were hit by projectiles that authorities are still trying to specify. 

The good news is that none of these shootings have been fatal. In fact, there's been only one related injury: A 13-year-old girl whose right ear was cut late last month when a bullet pierced the windshield of the SUV in which she was riding. 

But Milstead told CNN that luck may not hold out if this continues, which is why Gov. Doug Ducey referenced the shootings while tweeting that ""the safety of Arizonans is our number one priority."" 

""All of these acts are potentially lethal encounters,"" Milstead told CNN on Wednesday. ""When you're shooting into a moving vehicle with unwitting occupants, (it could be) lethal."" 

Official: Find shooter 'before someone is ... killed' 

Arthur Roderick, a former assistant director for the U.S. Marshals, noted the Phoenix shootings appear different from the October 2002 Washington-area sniper attacks that he helped investigate. 

For one, multiple weapons would be different from the single gun in the Beltway sniper case. And the latest shootings are more localized and not across several states. 

The more confined area could be a plus, with Roderick telling CNN, ""They're able to concentrate all their efforts in that one particular area."" 

That's what authorities are doing in Phoenix by utilizing state police, local departments' SWAT teams, FBI resources and highway surveillance cameras to keep an eye on the area. 

As to the motivation and who is responsible, Milstead said, ""We don't have a suspect in mind yet. 

""But we will find who this is,"" he added. ""And hopefully, we get to them before someone is seriously injured or killed.""",e446f8a4-fd5d-44f4-b15c-148023dae2a2,News,2015-09-11T02:27:32Z,KOCO 5,Phoenix I-10 shootings: Copycat possible,0.0,News
257,"2nd Sep 15 | Entertainment News  
Ed Skrein is desperate to team up with Jason Statham. 
 
Ed Skrein dreams of being as impressive in action scenes as Jason Statham. 

The two stars have a little something in common, as Ed is appearing in The Transporter Refuelled. It's the fourth film in The Transporter franchise and sees Ed replacing Jason as lead character Frank Martin. Frank is a highly-skilled driver who is known for being able to get any package from one place to another, no questions asked. 

Stepping into Jason's shoes was a big moment for Ed, who is in awe of the older star. 

""I'd love to work with him at some point if he was interested and it was right for the both of us. He's incredible and his skills in the action field are incredibly advanced. If I work hard and train hard, I can only hope to be close to what he's achieved,"" he told screenrant.com. 

This isn't the only major flick Ed is involved with. He's also scored a role in the eagerly-anticipated Deadpool, where Ryan Reynolds takes on the eponymous antihero. 

Ed's character is villain Ajax, but he's tight-lipped about whether we'll be seeing him on screens again. 

""[Tim Miller is] one of the directors I've most enjoyed working with. I feel like he got the best out of me in a lot of ways, so I'd love to work with him again whether it's another Deadpool movie or whether it's something else,"" he said. ""We'll have to wait and see. I'm just such a fan of what Ryan has done with the role and I'm just so proud to have done the one movie. Again, if it turns into 20 movies, great, or if it's just the one, I'm happy to have had the experience and the growth."" 

Although he's achieved a lot so far, there are still career areas Ed wants to explore. One of those would be taking on a superhero role himself, as he isn't all about the bad guy. 

""There's so many superheroes that I'd love to play, man. I always looked at Thundercats. I'd love to play Panthro! He was always a really cool dude, but then there's Lion-O!"" he laughed.",55eae05b-22a6-4bab-9dc2-b9947736451c,News,2015-09-02T13:00:00Z,TV3 Ireland,Ed Skrein: Me and Statham would be dream team,0.0,News

The suspects were not within our perimeter,"" Covelli told The Associated Press Wednesday morning. ""We had over 400 police officers out here yesterday. We had over 45 canine units and numerous aircraft,"" he said, adding that officers would now conduct ""saturation patrols"" in a wider area. Authorities from across the state and region joined the manhunt Tuesday in the village about 60 miles north of Chicago. Some wore tactical gear and toted high-powered rifles. Officers took up positions on rooftops and along railroad tracks, scanning the terrain with rifle scopes and binoculars. Others leaned out of helicopters with weapons at the ready. Federal agencies, SWAT teams and 48 police dogs assisted in the manhunt, Covelli said. Residents of the usually sleepy village were urged to stay indoors, and schools were on lockdown. In a statement late Tuesday, Covelli urged the community to reach out with tips and leads. Covelli said Gliniewicz radioed in Tuesday morning to tell dispatchers he was chasing three men on foot. Communication with him was lost soon after. Covelli said backup officers found him injured with a gunshot wound and that he died soon after. An emotional Fox Lake Mayor Donny Schmit described the slain officer as a personal friend, a three-decade member of the department and a father of four sons. ""We lost a family member,"" Schmit said of the 52-year-old officer known around town as ""GI Joe."" ''His commitment to the people of this community has been unmatched and will be dearly missed."" The area near the Wisconsin border area is popular for boating and other outdoor pursuits because of its forest preserves and a chain of lakes that partly encircles Fox Lake. Some longtime city dwellers move to the region for what is normally a quieter lifestyle. Authorities urged residents to stay home while they searched for the suspects, two of them white and the other black. Commuter train service was halted, and residents who wanted to take their dogs out to relieve themselves were told to stay inside, with the job of walking the pets handled by police officers. Several schools were locked down Tuesday, and seven cancelled classes on Wednesday, Covelli said. Gliniewicz's death is the third law enforcement fatality in Illinois this year, according to the Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. It says firearms-related deaths in the U.S. are down 13 percent this year compared to the same period last year, Jan. 1. to Sept. 1; there were 30 last year and 26 this year. Fox Lake residents expressed sorrow at the death of the immensely popular Gliniewicz. ""This particular officer is a pillar in my community and (is) definitely going to be missed, and (he) touched so many lives,"" said Gina Maria, a 40-year-old teacher. Dozens gathered for hours along a street in the village to show their support for law enforcement officers. Thirty-year-old Dan Raminick, who held a sign reading ""Police Lives Matter,"" said officers came by Tuesday evening and thanked the crowd. Caitlyn Kelly, a 22-year-old student, said she felt compelled to come out after other recent police shootings. She held a sign that said ""Blue and Brave.""",c2c12e0f-0eda-4c55-86cb-5c778d7705fb,News,2015-09-01T19:48:55Z,Wicked Local Boxborough,Hunt for 3 suspects in Illinois officer's death continues,0.0,News

3135,"For Donald Trump, the hits just keep on coming.  

A Rolling Stone profile piece on the billionaire front-runner recounts an episode in which Trump mocks rival Republican candidate Carly Fiorina's looks. The alleged slight took place aboard Trump's plane following a rally in Hampton, New Hampshire. The candidate was watching Fox News as staff members looked on. Reporter Paul Solotaroff described Trump's reaction when Fiorina appeared on screen:  

"" Look  at that face!"" he cries. ""Would anyone  vote  for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next  president ?!"" The laughter grows halting and faint behind him. ""I mean, she's a woman, and I'm not s'posedta say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we  serious ?""   

“Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!” 
 
Donald Trump 
 
""I think those comments speak for themselves,"" Fiorina said Wednesday on Megyn Kelly's show, adding, ""Maybe, just maybe I'm getting under his skin a little bit because I am climbing in the polls.""  

In fact, Trump had also singled out Fiorina at the Hampton rally, warning her in terms similar to those he used with moderator Kelly during the first Republican debate. 

""Carly was a little nasty to me—be  careful,  Carly! Be  careful ! But I can't say anything to her because she's a woman. . . . I  promised  that I wouldn't say that she ran Hewlett-Packard into the ground. I said I wouldn't say it! That her stock value tanked. That she laid off tens of thousands of people, and she got viciously fired. I said I will not  say  that. And that she then went out and ran against Barbara  Boxer,  and . . . lost in a landslide. And I said, 'I. Will. Not. Say. That!' "" 

Fiorina, who had strong performance in the GOP's undercard debate, lashed out at Trump over his attack on Kelly, tweeting, ""Mr. Trump: There. Is. No. Excuse."" 

The two candidates will share the stage during the second Republican debate on Sept. 17 on CNN.  ",0978cf4a-c9f5-40e0-9796-41dd24fb6e2d,News,2015-09-10T01:28:21Z,Bloomberg,Rolling Stone: Donald Trump Mocked Carly Fiorina's Looks,0.0,Blog

I'm no hypocrite. But I'm sick of seeing my posts that way too. If you've noticed, I've been trying to change my blogging style. More genuine, less cheese(to no cheese, even in real life I don't eat cheese) I'm in no position to criticize other bloggers so the only person I can push is myself. So last month, ELF Philippines sent me over their Eyebrow Doctor box filled with different products from brow pencils, brow powders, primers, and brow stencils to try. Ang dami no? Thank you ELF Philippines. I like multi-purpose makeup so I decided to use and feature their Eyebrow Lifter and Filler.  It's a dual-tip eyepencil with built-in sharpener One side is for highlighting. It is in light beige color The other side is for shading and filling in. It is in taupe brown color. My bare brows. I had these shaped at Benefit Brow Bar. The pencil is hard, and just gives off the right amount of pigment to fill in the brows without looking fake. I prefer brow pencils that is hard. The Elf Eyebrow Lifter and Filler reminds me of Shu Uemura's hard pencils. These are my brows are filling them in, and highlighting the under brows. Looks natural no? And it's pretty cheap! They didn't indicate the price but ELF products like this costs less than 200 pesos and can be bought at any SM Beauty located in SM Department Stores. I have LOADS of eyebrow products in my stash so I doubt I'll be repurchasing this really soon but this pencil isn't too shabby at all. It's quite nice. I like it. :) ELF Philippines Website: http://www.eyeslipsface.ph/ I hope you enjoyed this post as much as I did writing it!

2841,"Rising importance of e-commerce is reflected in students’ academic choices at university 
 
e-commerce subjects in high demand 

The value of e-commerce is expected to top $13 billion by 2020, making it one of the fastest-growing sectors in the region, and for students looking to future-proof their career prospects, it seems that focused education in this field is becoming increasingly popular. 
 
The new academic year at Canadian University Dubai (CUD) has witnessed more demand than ever for its unique ‘Bachelor of Commerce in e-Business’ program, which provides students with the opportunity to develop a multi-disciplinary skillset, while gaining hands-on experience of the processes and tools associated with technology-related business solutions. 
 
A strategic shift towards integrated, smart government systems, combined with improvements in commercial services operating online have helped to build consumer confidence in electronic retail, and the region now stands at the gateway of an e-commerce revolution for which a whole new blend of skills are required. 
 
Dr. Anas Najdawi, Assistant Professor at CUD said, “Degree programs have traditionally focused upon either the technical competencies, or the business skills, but rarely combine the two. Technology is now embedded in all business functions and professionals in any industry need to know how to apply it effectively.” 
 
He continued, “The growing proliferation of free tools and platforms means that technology is also the foundation of much of today’s entrepreneurial activity, as it offers a low-cost solution to test and grow innovations and new business concepts.” 
 
As the only undergraduate course of its kind in the UAE, the e-Business program at CUD offers students the unique opportunity to gain real-world insights into the application of technology in a business environment through its dedicated e-Business Lab, established in partnership with enterprise software corporation, SAP. 
 
Dispelling the notion that e-Business requires a technical mindset, Dr. Najdawi revealed that the program is as popular among students who are interested in pursuing a career in marketing, as those who want to be at the forefront of business technology solutions. 
 
“The e-Business program is about providing students with the theoretical knowledge and, most importantly, the practical skills to use existing technology to achieve business goals, whether that is as a digital marketer, enterprise resource planner, business intelligence analyst, or as an innovator and entrepreneur. The applications for technology, and therefore the career opportunities, are limitless.” 
 
As businesses continue to target technology as a strategic area of investment, and e-commerce accelerates to take on current boom industries such as aviation in the growth stakes, it’s clear that e-Business is emerging as one of the foremost programs for students who want to be a part of the next generation of wealth-creating enterprises.

83,"Residents threw garbage at a United National Congress (UNC) entourage and chased its candidate Raziah Ahmed, former Senate President and acting President of T&T, out of Ramsaran Street, San Fernando yesterday during a walkabout in the marginal constituency of San Fernando West. 
 
Police were called in even though Ahmed said she was in no way threatened by the disgruntled residents.  
 
As a banner of People’s National Movement (PNM) candidate Faris Al-Rawi fluttered in the wind, the residents said they did not want to see any politician at election time because of the “gimmicks.” 
 
Natalie Des Vignes, from Ramsaran Street apartments, who contested the local government elections on an Independent Liberal Party (ILP) ticket last year, said they were unhappy with the UNC. 
 
“We fight in the last elections with Carolyn Seepersad-Bachan and she give us nothing. We don’t even have a Cepep contract here to clean the place. We, the residents, have to chip up every month to raise money to cut the yard,” Des Vignes said. The lawn outside the apartment buildings was littered with beer bottles and other debris. 
 
She added, “We have no work here and we don’t mind getting a few contracts because people here cannot even afford to buy food.” 
 
Another resident, who requested anonymity, said, “We don’t want to see the UNC here. All they doing is passing and waving. What they feel this is a beauty contest? Children hungry here and the only way we will welcome them inside here is if they treat us better.” 
 
A third resident added, “Kamla need to come here to Embacadere and meet with us. Come and check the youths, don’t send anybody else.” 
 
Meanwhile, Vicky Ramlogan, who was part of Ahmed’s entourage said police were called in when the residents started to get unruly. 
 
“They should not get on so because people have a right to vote for whoever they want. This is a democracy,” Ramlogan said.  
 
He added that the residents threw their garbage at the entourage, without any care for the environment. 
 
Ahmed said yesterday that it was the first time that she received such a response during her walkabouts. 
 
“People came out on the road and started to shout. We continued to walk. I didn’t hear what they were saying,” she said. 
 
Asked whether she was getting a negative response from the San Fernando West constituents, Ahmed responded, “The feeling we are getting is that some people clearly supports us and there are others who clearly do not support us. This is the first street where we got that response. We haven’t had this kind of situation before where people are getting on with themselves. I don’t know what their problem is but we are here to bring service to the people.” Police continued patrols in the area up to press time but there were no incidents of violence.",07847437-3ffe-42d5-9f8a-0bec86b4d706,News,2015-09-02T06:57:53Z,Trinidad Guardian,Garbage thrown at Ahmed’s tour,0.0,News
1444,"One Maury County organization celebrated a decade of work with a mayoral proclamation recognizing its mission and September as “Suicide Prevention Awareness” month. 
 
Cowboy Up is a Maury County Junior Auxiliary service project that focuses on prevention of youth suicide through educational programs. The project began in 2005 as the brainchild of local educator Regina Peery. 
 
Maury County Mayor Charlie Norman signed the document at the courthouse last with Cowboy Up and JA members. 
 
The proclamation states suicide is “one of the most disruptive and tragic events a family and a community can experience.” There have been 69 recorded suicides in Maury County in the past five years, including three that were between the ages of 10 and 19, according to the document. 
 
“Whereas, public awareness of the terrifying problem is the key to preventing further suffering and loss of life; and the risk for human self-destruction can be reduced through awareness, education and treatment; and as the highest risk for suicide is among the survivors of those who died by suicide or those who have attempted suicide,” it reads. 
 
The document goes on to tout Cowboy Up’s role in the community and declares September as Suicide Prevention Month in the county. 
 
For Peery, Cowboy Up has a personal meaning. Her brother, Marcus, committed suicide in 2003, and she founded the organization in 2005 in his memory. The name is based on a saying he used. 
 
Peery said she wants to do anything in her power to prevent another family from going through the “wrath” of suicide. 
 
“I hope that this creates more awareness for people who may be having suicidal feelings to know that there is help available and for families who have been touched by suicide,” she said. “We want them to know that they are not alone.” 
 
The program has garnered attention from across the state. The Tennessee Suicide Prevention Network honored Peery with an award in 2013. 
 
Cowboy Up is presented to all seventh grade students in Maury County and other school districts. The group’s motto is taken from her father’s words. 
 
“If we help one family, one child, then it is worth everything that we put into it,” Peery said. 
 
Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among youth and young adults ages 15-24 in Tennessee and for the entire United States, according to the TSPN. There were 945 recorded suicide deaths in the state in 2014, at a rate of 14.4 per 100,000 people, according to the organization. 
 
Cowboy Up is a project of Junior Auxiliary members, the Maury County school system, the Jason Foundation, Tennessee Suicide Prevention Network and the Maury County Sheriff Reserves. 
 
“It has taken a lot of folks to make it successful, and to be able to celebrate that today and acknowledge that and create awareness, it means more than I can fit into words,” Peery said.

2184,"“He refuses to leave me alone…” “In trying to terminate a romantic relationship, Nick Haggenmiller has refused to leave me alone”, that’s part of an email sent to the City of Northfield’s Human Resources Manager Michelle Mahowald from the person who filed a complaint against the City Administrator.  The email is dated August 21st but within the formal complaint is an indication that this person complained in May when, according to the complaint, she tried to end the relationship for a 2nd time.  Her name and other information has been redacted from the complaint. The Northfield news reported that it is a female department head after listening at the door of the first closed meeting on September 8th.  There are only 2 of them at City Hall.  No one from City Hall is talking.  The only communication is through data request forms sent to Mahowald.   According to Haggenmiller’s separation agreement his employment formally ends September 30th.  He’ll receive another 2 months salary and health insurance paid through November 30th. redacted written complaint Haggenmiller separation agreement Council meets for work session The Northfield City Council meets tonight for a work session.  They’ll hear from Bike Northfield who is proposing more bike lanes in an effort to be get a bronze certification in the Bicycle Friendly Community program.  Leah Eby with Growing Up Healthy will give a mid-contract report as will Executive Director of the Northfield Historical Society.  Public Works Director Dave Bennett will report on the public works organizational analysis.   Mayor Graham will be in studio tomorrow morning at 7:20 with a recap.

3129,"Congress has until Sept. 30 to pass a spending bill

President Barack Obama met with top Democratic leaders behind closed doors at the White House Thursday as Congress scrambles to avoid a government shutdown. 

Speaking to reporters outside the West Wing following the hour-and-a-half-long huddle that focused on budget negotiations, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid announced that he, Obama and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi were in agreement on a short-term continuing resolution to keep the government running and allow time for negotiations on a ""meaningful"" budget. 

Democrats want to keep pressure on Republicans to negotiate a broader budget deal that would remove the across-the-board forced spending cuts, known as ""sequestration,"" that are in place now. The sooner they reach a deal, the sooner domestic programs would potentially be less impacted by these budget cuts. 

Pelosi said she felt prepared heading into budget talks focused on a deal that lifted sequestration caps in a way that domestic spending was increased at the same rate as defense spending -- ""dollar for dollar,"" as she put it. 

Reid praised Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for acknowledging that something needed to be done on caps as well as discussing a clean continuing resolution, one that addresses funding the government without adding on other provisions, such as defunding Planned Parenthood. 

Congress has until September 30 to pass a spending bill and avert a government shutdown. Many House Republicans say they will not vote for a bill that provides any funding for the controversial women's health organization. 

House Republican leaders are expected to soon move forward with a short-term funding bill. Separately, they would aim to pass a measure to defund Planned Parenthood through a process known as ""budget reconciliation"" that would bypass a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. 

But Pelosi said she was optimistic about the chances of avoiding a shutdown. 

""I'm hopeful that we're all in agreement ... that we should not have a government shutdown,"" she said. ""It's costly to the government and to the American people. So we are optimistic, we want to be cooperative, we want to negotiate in good faith."" 

The White House later released a statement, saying Hill Democrats ""would support a clean, short-term continuing resolution to provide more time to negotiate an agreement that invests in middle-class economic priorities and helps our entire economy grow."" 

Later Thursday, Pelosi met with House Speaker John Boehner for roughly 20 minutes in the speaker's office to discuss next steps on funding the government. 

""We're having a conversation about getting close to how we negotiate,"" Pelosi told reporters. 

She didn't know when they would sit down again to get into specific details, and said they had not arrived on an overall budget level yet. 

Pelosi said she didn't like a GOP proposal to pass a stopgap bill to fund the government through mid-December 

""I'd rather have it be a shorter term (continuing resolution),"" she said. ""Why should we put it off?""",e9eac59e-dcdf-458b-8f45-3edc3ed0386c,News,2015-09-18T03:01:42Z,Everything Lubbock,"Pelosi, Reid scramble to avoid gov't shutdown",0.0,Blog

1373,"Dear Dr. Carson,
 
 I write to express my disappointment at best for your statements on the NBC Sunday broadcast of ""Meet the Press"" on September 20, 2015. Host Chuck Todd raised the controversy surrounding Donald Trump's failure to correct an audience member in a town hall meeting in New Hampshire last week who asserted that President Obama is a Muslim, and then he advocated for the forceful deportation of Muslims from the U.S. Todd then asked you about your take on the controversy, to which you replied that a Muslim should not become president of our country: ""I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation. I absolutely would not agree with that.""
 
 As a highly educated person, as a candidate for the presidency, and as someone who has co-authored, along with your wife Candy, a book titled A More Perfect Union: What We the People Can Do to Reclaim Our Constitutional Liberties, you should have a more enlightened understanding of our nation's foundational document. 
 
 In the book you write generally about the ""basic principles"" of the Constitution and how ""they relate to our everyday lives."" You go on to state: ""I believe that making a difference starts with understanding our amazing founding document, the U.S. Constitution."" You assert that both you and Candy wrote the book to ""help defend"" the Constitution ""from those who misinterpret and undermine it."" 
 
 Well, now I'm really confused! How can you inform others and ""help defend"" the Constitution when you do not have even a basic understanding? Your recorded statements indicate that you have misinterpreted and undermined the document. If this were not the case, you would not have made your blatantly Islamophobic assertions on ""Meet the Press,"" especially when Todd asked you, ""So do you believe that Islam is consistent with the Constitution,"" and you replied, ""No, I don't. I do not."" 
 
 Your answer leads me to believe that you practice a version of ""cafeteria Constitutionalism"" picking and choosing which of the passages should refer to which groups of people. Since you are a Christian follower of the Seventh Day Adventist Church, I am assuming that you are not placing Article VI of the US Constitution on your cafeteria tray: ""No religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States."" In addition, you seem to want to delete the First Amendment from the menu and toss it down the garbage disposal: ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ...""
 
 When Donald Trump makes his racist and xenophobic statements about immigrants, and when he throws misogynistic tantrums about women, and when he does not correct questioners about President Obama's religion and birth status, I am not particularly surprised since Trump has centered his entire campaign on issues and discussions based on hate and fear that seem to have resonated with the base of the Republican Party. 
 
 You Dr. Carson, in fact, appear to practice the same sort of despicable tactics as Donald Trump (as well as many others with whom you share the debate stage and the clown car as you all drive down the path toward the presidential primaries). I see an underlying philosophical trend among many of you Republican candidates, whether on issues around immigration, issues of equity between genders and sexual identities, and issues of religion. 
 
 Once people like yourselves have entered the doorway of opportunity, you attempt to close the door in the face of others. All of the candidates are citizens of the United States, so now you want to close the door of citizenship to others. Since you all have quality healthcare, you want to take it away from the estimated 16 million people who now have health insurance for the first time under the Affordable Care Act. Though you may assume that all presidents since George Washington have followed Christian faiths -- though some have defined themselves instead as ""Deists"" -- you want to close the door of the office to anyone other than those of you with verified Christian credentials. 
 
 Dr. Carson, you are running for the presidency by standing on the shoulders of the brave and tireless pioneers who came before you who made it possible for you and for Mr. Obama. I still remember seeing on television the lunch counter sit-ins, the voting rights registration drives, the ""Freedom Schools,"" the marches, and the many other forms of civil disobedience aimed at abolishing discriminatory and abusive ""Jim Crow"" laws, which advanced and strengthened white supremacy by maintaining segregation and withholding the ballot from people of color. 
 
 Your statements and those of many of your challengers on the Republican side of the political spectrum are replicating discriminatory policies by advancing and strengthening Christian supremacy by maintaining segregation and withholding opportunities from non-Christians, in particular, Muslims. How ""Constitutional"" Dr. Carson are these actions? 
 
 In your book you write: ""And as someone who has performed brain surgery thousands of times, I can assure you that the Constitution isn't brain surgery."" Well, Dr. Carson, maybe you need to rethink your candidacy, and instead keep your day job, since you understand much better the structures of the brain instead of how to use it to defend and preserve the Constitution of the United States of America.

3884,"Manchester City were left to count the cost of wasted chances after surrendering a lead to lose their Champions League opener against Juventus. 
 
		 
City looked in control of the Group D encounter at the Etihad Stadium after taking the lead courtesy of a Giorgio Chiellini own goal just before the hour. 
  It was a night of missed chances for Manchester City   
But Raheem Sterling, David Silva and Wilfried Bony were then all denied by the brilliant Gianluigi Buffon and Juve claimed a 2-1 win with fine goals from strikers Mario Mandzukic and Alvaro Morata. 

			 
Sterling also spurned an opportunity in the second minute while Fernandinho twice went close and Bony sliced another effort horribly wide before the break. 



 
Manager Manuel Pellegrini admitted his side needed to be more clinical but refused to apportion blame, particularly with £49million man Sterling facing criticism for his misses. 

The Chilean said: ""I expect that when we have chances we must score. The differences are very slight, especially against a strong team like Juventus. Maybe Juventus didn't create so many chances but they had a strong finish. 

""I don't think this result is just because of Raheem. We controlled the game and didn't have many problems but football is like that. 

""I don't think we deserved to lose. We played better than Juventus and we had three clear opportunities to score. 

			 
""Buffon made some very good saves but I think we were very unlucky. We never want to lose here at home, we never want to lose important points, but we have 15 points more to play for."" 

Juve boss Massimiliano Allegri was more gushing in his praise for Buffon after a superb display from his veteran captain. 

The 37-year-old's double save from Sterling and Silva soon after City had taken a controversial lead - with Chiellini claiming he had been impeded by Vincent Kompany - was particularly impressive and a key moment. 

Allegri said: ""Buffon pulled off many miraculous saves, particularly just after we went 1-0 down. Buffon is an extraordinary goalkeeper, perhaps the best ever in the history of football. He never fails."" 

			 
Another critical moment came after 75 minutes, with the score at 1-1, as City skipper Kompany was forced off with a calf injury. 

His replacement Nicolas Otamendi, making his City debut, was caught out and Morata curled in a brilliant winner. 

City will now wait on updates on Kompany's condition ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash with West Ham. 

City missed Sergio Aguero up front with their star striker limited to just six minutes off the bench due to a knee injury. 

Pellegrini said: ""It was a risk to use him. I tried not to because if he got a kick in the same part it could take him more days to recover. Fortunately he did not have any problems and I hope he will be fit for Saturday.""

2438,"It will be no easy task for the New York Mets to retain Yoenis Cespedes, especially after his performance following the trade deadline. 
 
By Thomas Carannante  t.carannante@hngn.com | Sep 14, 2015 05:37 PM EDT 
    
Yoenis Cespedes (Photo : Mike Ehrmann/) 
    
The unprecedented rise of Yoenis Cespedes is still taking place right before our eyes. As the New York Mets storm through the MLB and lead the Washington Nationals by 9.5 games in the NL East, rumors are beginning to focus on the outfielder's future with the team. 

 
Cespedes, 29, is batting .308/.353/.680 with 35 runs scored, 16 home runs and 41 RBIs in 40 games with the Mets, which is incredible considering he was batting .293/.323/.506 with 62 runs scored, 18 home runs and 61 RBIs in his previous 102 games with the Detroit Tigers. 

 
Cespedes signed a four-year, $36 million deal with the Oakland Athletics before the 2012 season, but it wasn't until this year that he was regarded as an elite outfielder. In case you don't recall, Cespedes batted just .269/.296/.423 with 27 runs scored, 5 home runs and 33 RBIs in 51 games with the Boston Red Sox after he was traded for Jon Lester last season. 

 
On top of that, rumors suggested Cespedes ""marched to his own drum and the coaches all hate him,"" indicating he was a poor team player, and, perhaps at times, insubordinate. Well, much has changed over the past year. 

 
""Besides Oakland, the teams most interested in Yoenis Cespedes when he came from Cuba were the Indians, White Sox, Phillies and Marlins,"" FOX Sports' Ken Rosenthal said in his MLB weekend update. ""Of course, that was almost four years ago, and the market now won't necessarily include those teams, but it does stand to reason that it will be considerably larger. Cespedes has proven that he can solidify a lineup like few players in the game. We saw Oakland miss him after he was gone last year, and we've seen how the Mets have benefitted from his presence."" 

 
Last week we wrote the Los Angeles Angels could be a top destination for Cespedes , and a lot of that had to do with what was reported last week. 

 
""Cespedes won't be an easy sign, as people who know him say 'he's a businessman' at heart, and he's not likely to take an offer that isn't the best one he gets,"" writes Jon Heyman of CBS Sports . 

 
""Many others also wouldn't mind an outfield bat with impact power, not to mention an all-world arm, plus speed and unusual flair (a bonus), and he's probably raised his take by as much as 50 percent with his amazing stretch-run play, to the point where he looks like he's moved to the top of a star-studded free-agent outfield list that also includes Justin Upton, Jason Heyward and presumably Alex Gordon once he opts out. Even in this environment, Cespedes could fetch $175-million-plus."" 

 
A $175-million-plus deal does not sound like the New York Mets, does it? New York's payroll exceeded $100 million this season for the first time since 2011 . Aside from David Wright's 14-year, $192 million deal, the next biggest contract on the Mets belongs to Curtis Granderson - a paltry four-year, $60 million deal (for a New York franchise). 

 
""Yoenis Cespedes leaving Flushing after this season becomes evermore realistic,"" writes Jeff Passan of Yahoo! Sports . ""Do not see this as the tooting of the sad trombone so much as a reminder that Cespedes has played himself into the sort of monetary range from which the Mets have shied since double-barreling Carlos Beltran and Johan Santana. 

 
""And unlike Beltran and Santana, who were long among the best at their position, Cespedes crystallized his place near the top of this monstrous free-agent class only in the past few months. Coming into this season, Cespedes, 29, was regarded as a good outfielder with monstrous power and enough flaws to keep him from ascending into that elite class."" 

 
There are a number of MLB clubs that could use Cespedes' all-around contribution. The Mets did adjust the clause in his contract that would have forced them to re-sign him within five days after the World Series, but they're going to need much more help than that.",0301b656-5d17-475c-943c-2a2de015a6af,News,2015-09-14T21:37:33Z,Hngn.com,"MLB RUMORS: NY Mets, Yoenis Cespedes Headed for Divorce in Free Agency?

1299,"The following recap was provided by the Pittsburgh Riverhounds 
 
PITTSBURGH (Sept. 16, 2015) – The Pittsburgh Riverhounds tied the United Soccer League regular season champion Rochester Rhinos 1-1 Wednesday night at Highmark Stadium to set up a pulsating finale to the Eastern Conference this Saturday night in Harrisburg. 
 
The result allied with victories for the Harrisburg City Islanders and Richmond Kickers Wednesday leaves the Hounds needing to win in Pennsylvania’s state capital to clinch a spot in the USL playoffs. A tie or a loss will end the Hounds’ season. 
 
Lebo Moloto broke the deadlock after 69 minutes of a typically cagey affair against the Rhinos with a brilliant curling shot from 30 yards. Christian Volesky leveled for the visitors with seven minutes remaining. 
 
“We didn’t play well in the first half and we played into their style,” said Hounds head coach Mark Steffens. “I thought we did well defensively and had the better of the play in the second half. 
 
“I’m proud of the guys.” 
 
The Hounds (10-9-8, 38 points) lie in eighth place going into the final weekend. Harrisburg (11-10-6, 39 points) sits one point and one place ahead after thumping F.C. Montreal 5-0 earlier in the evening. Three points Saturday will pull Pittsburgh level with the fifth-placed Richmond Kickers (10-7-11, 41 points). Steffens’ men hold the head-to-head advantage over the Virginians. 
 
A scoreless first half was played to the tempo that the Rhinos preferred. Rochester’s towering fullback Onua Obasi proved prolific in winning his challenges and creating potentially dangerous turnovers in the midfield. 
 
Rochester forward Steevan Dos Santos came closest to finding the net in the opening period with a low shot on 34 minutes that Hounds’ goalkeeper Calle Brown tipped onto his right post. 
 
Max Touloute looked lively early in the game after receiving his first start since Aug. 22. The Haitian forward dribbled through multiple opponents on 17 minutes before going down under a fair challenge in the penalty area. Kevin Kerr released Touloute into space on the right side on 29 minutes. Rochester’s stuffy defense closed him out before he could get his cross over toward the lurking Vini Dantas. 
 
Moloto netted his fifth goal of his first year in Pittsburgh with a stunning finish that left Rhinos goalkeeper Adam Grinwis helpless. The South African playmaker spun toward Rochester’s goal after receiving a pass from Rob Vincent before creating space via a sharp one-two with substitute Miro Cabrilo. Moloto arched a spectacular shot high above Grinwis’ reach and into the goalkeeper’s top left corner. 
 
Grinwis was much more active in the second half. Cabrilo hit a wicked shot on 81 minutes that looked to be slicing towards the far post until the Michigan Bucks product touched it wide. 
 
Holding onto late leads has been the Hounds’ Achilles heel this season. They were outdone again by a rapid Rhinos sequence when substitutes Colin Rolfe and Nate Bordeau combined to send Volesky clear on Brown’s goal. The 23-year-old forward clipped a neat finish over the sprawling goalkeeper. 
 
Vincent almost won it for the Hounds on a 20-yard free kick two minutes later. The Steel Army’s Player of the Year unleashed a ferocious drive that drew an exceptional diving save out of Grinwis. 
 
The Hounds travel to Harrisburg also holding the edge in the Keystone Derby series by virtue of two wins to the Islanders’ one. Kevin Kerr’s hat trick fired the Hounds to a 5-2 victory at Highmark Stadium to open the season back on March 28. Kerr then supplied the dramatic late winner on May 30 when Pittsburgh recovered from a 5-3 deficit in the final minute to record an incredible 6-5 win. 
 
Harrisburg pulled off its own breathtaking comeback at the Skyline Sports Complex on July 26 to recover from 3-1 down with 10 men to win 4-3 in stoppage time. 
 
A tie will be enough for the Riverhounds to lift the inaugural Keystone Derby Cup. Harrisburg must win by at least a 3-goal margin to keep the trophy in the Pennsylvania state capital during the offseason.

4678,"Homemade pumpkin crayons are a fun non-candy Halloween treat to give out to trick or treaters.  DIY pumpkin crayons are also a great addition to kids Thanksgiving place settings to keep them busy before dinner. 
 

 
Last year I ran across the Teal Pumpkin Project on Facebook.  I am blessed with two healthy kids with no food allergies and I try not to take that for granted. It broke my heart to think of a little kid not being safe to go to trick or treating for fear of dying from eating the wrong candy.  Even though it was just a few days before  Halloween, I made sure to have a non-candy options for kids with allergies.  This year, though, I thought we’d make a cute little bag for non-candy options and include a coloring sheet and these adorable homemade pumpkin crayons! 
 
These little crayons just take a few minutes to make.  Not only are they great for non-candy trick or treating, they would also be adorable at the kids table at Thanksgiving! 
 

 
Supplies needed: 
Assorted orange/tan/dark yellow crayons 
Small donut tin 
Non stick cooking spray 
Oven 
 
Directions: 
 
1. Begin by breaking your crayons in half and removing all of the paper coverings. 
 
  
 
2. Break the crayons into smaller segments. You should be able to get 4 segments or so out of each crayon. 
 
3. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Spray your pan of choice with a mist of non stick cooking spray. 
 
4. Add the broken crayons pieces into the tray. You want to fill each cup about half full. 
 

 
5. Bake at 350 degrees for 10-15 minutes or until the wax is liquefied. 
 
6. Remove and allow to cool. Place in the freezer for 10 minutes to help loosen the wax. 
 
7. Gently turn over the pan and allow the crayons to fall out. 
 
8. Tie a length of green felt or ribbon through each crayon for a stem. 
 

 
Your pumpkin crayons are now ready to be used and enjoyed.

577,"HAMPTON, N.J., Sept. 30, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bellerophon Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:BLPH), a clinical-stage biotherapeutics company, announced that an oral presentation of late-breaking data from a clinical trial sponsored by the Company was presented today at the European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress 2015 in Amsterdam. The data showed that INOpulse® 

In the trial, 6 subjects (3 male and 3 female between the ages of 65-79) with pulmonary hypertension associated with COPD on long-term oxygen therapy were given an acute dose of INOpulse inhaled nitric oxide. Following treatment, the subjects underwent functional respiratory imaging to determine the geometry of their lungs, airway and pulmonary vascular structures.

In all of the subjects, administration of inhaled nitric oxide resulted in increased blood volume in the blood vessels in the lungs while also preserving oxygen saturation following treatment. Anecdotally, all patients in the trial reported having felt better following the treatment.

Jonathan Peacock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Bellerophon Therapeutics, stated, ""We continue to be encouraged by the progress we are making in the development of INOpulse as a potential treatment for pulmonary hypertension. This late-breaker session at the ERS Congress builds on earlier studies indicating that INOpulse has the potential to reduce pulmonary hypertension in COPD patients. In the next several months, we plan to test the effect of reducing pulmonary hypertension on exercise capacity for these patients.""

About Pulmonary Hypertension 

Pulmonary hypertension is a rare lung disorder in which the arteries that carry blood from the heart to the lungs become narrowed, making it difficult for blood to flow through the vessels. As a result, the blood pressure in these arteries -- called pulmonary arteries -- rises far above normal levels. This abnormally high pressure strains the right ventricle of the heart, causing it to expand in size. Overworked and enlarged, the right ventricle gradually becomes weaker and loses its ability to pump enough blood to the lungs. This could lead to the development of right heart failure.

About Bellerophon 

Bellerophon Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biotherapeutics company focused on developing innovative therapies at the intersection of drugs and devices that address significant unmet medical needs in the treatment of cardiopulmonary and cardiac diseases. The Company is currently developing two product candidates under its INOpulse® program, a proprietary pulsatile nitric oxide delivery device. The first is for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), for which the Company intends to commence Phase 3 clinical trials in 2015, and the other for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (PH-COPD), which is in Phase 2 development. The Company's plans also call for the completion of further work on the use of INOpulse to treat pulmonary hypertension associated with COPD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis during 2016. Additionally, management is reviewing alternative paths forward for its Bioabsorbable Cardiac Matrix program. For more information, please visit www.bellerophon.com.

1259,"The Saskatchewan Roughriders have opted go with experience over youth for Saturday's game against the Ottawa Redblacks. 
 
Interim head coach Bob Dyce announced on Tuesday that Kevin Glenn will start at quarterback ahead of rookie Brett Smith. 
 
""Our objective this week is to win. Kevin Glenn gives us the best opportunity to win this game against Ottawa, so he will start at quarterback,"" said Dyce. 
 
This decision was really the first major one that Dyce has had to make since being named to his new job a couple of weeks ago. 
 
There were two prevailing thoughts when it came to Glenn or Smith this week. Should the Riders put their best foot forward to win, or try and develop for the future with the playoffs all but mathematically out of the equation? 
 
""The playoffs may be out for (the media and fans) but not for us. There's still an opportunity,"" said Dyce. 
 
""The real reason is this, when we walked into the room a while ago, we said our focus was winning games."" 
 [embedded content] 
Glenn has been out since tearing his pectoral muscle against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats on July 26 at Mosaic Stadium. 
 
Even though it's only been a month-and-a-half, for Glenn, it's felt like an eternity since he was able to play. 
 
""My concern was just to get back healthy. Get back and healthy and when I can give the opportunity or I get an opportunity to help the team, then I'm just going to try and take advantage of it,"" he said. 
 
Smith will now return to the role of backup quarterback, a job he held for a few weeks after Darian Durant went down with a season ending injury in the opening week of the season. 
 
Dyce feels that Smith dropping down the depth chart will actually be a good thing for him. 
 
""Now it gives him an opportunity to see how a very successful professional quarterback operates and manages a game. That's just something Brett hasn't had the opportunity to see."" 
 
Smith admits that taking a step back is always a little frustrating because as a player, you want to play. Overall though, he understands the decision and will do what he can to help the team. 
 
""That's the direction that the coaches want to go, I'm going to be the best teammate I can for Kevin,"" he said. 
 MESSAM MISSES PRACTICE  
Another big story line out of practice on Tuesday was the status of running back Jerome Messam. 
 
During Saturday's Banjo Bowl, Messam left the game after taking a pretty serious hit. Messam returned to the game some 10 minutes later. 
 
On Tuesday, Dyce announced that Messam was going through the concussion protocol. That begs the question, why was he allowed to return the game? 
 
""Here's the thing, you don't know necessarily with regards to if someone has a concussion. There's a lot of different things that go into diagnosing a concussion. More than I can understand, that's for sure,"" said Dyce. 
 
""We have 100 per cent faith in our medical staff that they make the right decisions."" 
 NEWS AND NOTES  
Also absent from practice on Tuesday were defensive back Terrell Maze and fullback Scott McHenry. 
 
Fullback Spencer Moore returned to practice as he's eligible to return from the six-game injured list, as did receiver Seydou Junior Hadaira. 
 
The Riders announced on Tuesday the release of defensive back Mark LeGree and quarterback Blake Sims. 
 
Linebacker Denicos Allen, defensive back Kip Edwards and defensive lineman David Hunter were also added to the team's practice roster.",fe67bfc8-ab50-436f-ab73-147bdd26047b,News,2015-09-15T21:27:18Z,News Talk 650 CKOM,Kevin Glenn gets the call for Riders against Redblacks,0.0,News
3512,"WASHINGTON — Federal researchers recommended Friday that people 50 and older should work to push their blood pressure significantly below the commonly recommended target, saying a large new study offers critical guidance on a subject that has long been unclear. 
  
The new research advises those people to keep their systolic blood pressure — the top number in the reading that health-care providers routinely tell patients — to 120. When the study began in 2009, clinical guidelines called for a systolic blood pressure of 140 for healthy adults and 130 for adults with kidney disease or diabetes. 

In the study, blood pressure medication to keep systolic blood pressure at 120 cut the rate of heart attacks, strokes and heart failure by a third and the risk of death by almost 25 percent. Reaching the conclusions prompted researchers to cut the study short by about a year to report the news. 

Systolic blood pressure is a measure of the pressure in the arteries when the heart muscle contracts. Diastolic blood pressure, the bottom number, is a measure of the pressure in the arteries between heartbeats, when the heart muscle is resting and refilling with blood. 

""This study provides potentially lifesaving information that will be useful to health care providers as they consider the best treatment options for some of their patients, particularly those over the age of 50,"" Gary H. Gibbons, director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), said in a statement on the agency's Web site. The NHBLI was the primary sponsor of the study, which included 9,300 people age 50 and older. 

Between 2010 and 2013, researchers in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) divided people into two groups. One received medication to keep systolic blood pressure at 140, and another was given ""intensive treatment"" to bring blood pressure down to 120, through an average of three medications, according to the statement. 

The result shows that the lower pressure could save lives among adults age 50 and older with high blood pressure and at least one additional risk factor for heart disease. 

Howard S. Weintraub, clinical director of the NYU Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease, said in a statement, ""Physicians will need to make individualized decisions with each patient regarding how low their blood pressure should be."" He noted that for people over 75, there are risks involved in lowering blood pressure too far. 

About 70 million U.S. adults — nearly 1 in 3 — have high blood pressure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. High blood pressure greatly increases the risk of heart disease and stroke, the first and third leading causes of death for Americans, according to the CDC.",0a391d7a-5226-403f-84f4-117e7aaa4d59,News,2015-09-15T00:30:00Z,Register News,Federal researchers urge older adults to aim for much lower blood pressure,0.0,Blog
309,"Home Transportation Aviation News LOT and Frankfurt airport celebrate the 50th anniversary of Warsaw- Frankfurt flightsTransportationAviation NewsLOT and Frankfurt airport celebrate the 50th anniversary of Warsaw- Frankfurt flightsBy Iuliia Tore - Sep 7, 2015 Exactly 50 years ago, on 7 September 1965, LOT operated its  maiden scheduled flight between Warsaw and Frankfurt.  The German financial centre quickly became one of the key cities in LOT’s route network. Currently, the Polish carrier performs three flights a day between Warsaw and Frankfurt, offering three travel classes – LOT Business, LOT Premium Economy and LOT Economy Class as well as the most convenient schedule on this city pair. The first flight from Warsaw to Frankfurt was operated by an Ilyushin 18 aircraft. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, LOT was one of the first airlines using Western-type aircraft – mainly Boeing 737. Presently flights on this route are operated by comfortable Embraer 170, 175 and 195 aircraft, appreciated by passengers for their cabin comfort. Today, on the 50th anniversary of the inaugural flight, LOT, together with Frankfurt Airport, prepared a surprise for the passengers of the anniversary LO382 flight. Prior to the departure from Frankfurt all passengers participated in the cake cutting ceremony at the gate.  They were served snacks and refreshments and, naturally, a piece of the cake. Meanwhile, passengers travelling onboard the aircraft from Warsaw to Frankfurt and back to Warsaw heard a special announcement and were served an additional refreshment. “We are happy to celebrate this anniversary together with Frankfurt Airport and to recall how our offer developed over that time. We are currently the only airline that apart from Business and Economy class also offers LOT Premium Economy class on this route. It means that our passengers have even more freedom in choosing an offer which best suits their individual needs. We are also the carrier of choice for the business traveler. The 7:30 a.m. flight from Frankfurt to Warsaw is the first connection of the day between these two cities, catering to the business traveller community and ideal for a  one-day business trip” says Jiri Marek, LOT Sales and Distribution Executive Director.“German passengers choose Warsaw  more frequently to connect to LOT’s long-haul flights. Thanks to attractive prices and our Dreamliner fleet, as well as  continuously improved service, LOT flights with a transfer are becoming an ever more attractive alternative” adds Jiri Marek. Dr. Pierre-Dominique Prümm, head of Fraport AG’s Airside and Terminal Management unit, says: “Fraport AG is proud of the long-standing and excellent business relationship between Frankfurt Airport and LOT Polish Airlines. We look forward to the continuation of this very fruitful connection between Frankfurt and Warsaw. LOT is one of the most long-standing airlines serving into Frankfurt Airport. Today, LOT operates a modern fleet of environmentally-friendly aircraft, thus greatly contributing to our common success – now and in the future. This is all the more reason to celebrate this very special anniversary. We wish LOT many more years of ‘happy landings’.” LOT offers three flights a day between Warsaw and Frankfurt. Flights depart Warsaw at 7:45 a.m., 5:05 p.m. and 8:15 p.m., and depart Frankfurt at 7:30 a.m., 10:35 a.m. and 7:50 p.m. The Polish carrier is a member of Star Alliance as well as the Miles&More frequent flyer program. These are additional benefits for passengers travelling on this route. LOT is one of the most punctual airlines at  Frankfurt Airport.

1616,"Streaming service has crunched the numbers and has come up with a nifty equation that pinpoints the moment audiences commit to watching a show all the way to the end. 

Unlike traditional television, which puts viewers on a slow-drip diet of one or two shows a week, Netflix lets you hit the entertainment heroin as hard and as frequently as you want.

And it knows exactly how long you need to inject a stream into your main vein (your brain), before you get hooked.

The streaming service has crunched the numbers and has come up with a nifty equation that pinpoints the moment audiences commit to watching a show all the way to the end.

Netflix analysed data from January to July of this year in countries including Brazil, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the UK and the US. It took data from Australian and New Zealand accounts used between April and July.

It defines ""hooked"" as when 70 per cent of viewers who watched an episode went on to complete season one.

Netflix identified the hooked episodes first by country and then averaged them out to create a global hooked episode.

So how does Australia stack up?

Like most recreational drugs, different shows have different effects on viewers, and the data on the addiction equation therefore is a little all over the place. How long it takes to get addicted to a show on Netflix depends on the type and strength of the show.

According to the streaming company, Australians — we of discerning tastes — apparently remain eminently more resistant to the binge than our American brothers and sisters. 

It takes Australians one-to-two more episodes per show than the rest of the world before they are hooked. Australia takes six episodes of Daredevil to get hooked, whereas the rest of the world took five. It took the rest of the world only three episodes to get hooked on House of Cards. It took Australia five.

The resistance rate was slightly lower for ensemble dramedy Orange is the New Black, it took Australia only four episodes to get hooked. It only took three to hook the rest of the surveyed countries.

Surprisingly, the threshold for Netflix addiction was lowest in Australia for legal drama Suits and thriller The Killing, which took just three episodes to hook viewers into completing the entire series.

Crunching the numbers, Netflix also revealed the diminishing power of the pilot. Contrary to popular opinion, pilots are not what get viewers hooked, at least not according to Netflix' numbers.

""Given the precious nature of primetime slots on traditional TV, a series pilot is arguably the most important point in the life of the show,"" said Ted Sarandos, Chief Content Officer for Netflix. ""However, in our research of more than 20 shows across 16 markets, we found that no one was ever hooked on the pilot. This gives us confidence that giving our members all episodes at once is more aligned with how fans are made.""

This is a pretty interesting revelation by Netflix that supports the serialisation of entertainment.

It supports the idea that consumers that subscribe to TV streaming services have a longer attention span than traditional television studies assume.

It also means content creators get second, third, fourth and sometimes even fifth chances to impress viewers.

The data compiled by Netflix has the potential to create new metrics for TV viewing. Instead of counting the number of eyeballs on a particular show at a particular time, this data allows Netflix and other streaming services to measure a level of engagement and commitment not given priority in traditional entertainment measurements.

However, I do wonder what this means for the old fashioned movie.

Studios tightening their belts, producing less movies per year is already helping to hasten the demise of the action film, according to The New York Times 

But with the Netflix-isation of entertainment, could this data encourage a move away from film altogether? What will this do to the quality of independent cinema? Studios are already dependent upon the Marvels and LEGO movies of the world to fund the rest of their cinematic portfolio.

I can't imagine this data from Netflix is going to do anything to reverse those numbers.

--- 

1405 GMT 

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused Western nations of indifference to the plight of refugees, saying they shared the blame for the deaths of migrants off the coast of Turkey. 

Erdogan spoke Thursday, a day after 12 migrants drowned while trying to reach a Greek island. The dead included a 3-year-old boy whose body washed up on a Turkish beach, galvanizing a worldwide debate about migration. 

Erdogan said: ""It's not just refugees who drown in the Mediterranean, it's humanity, humanity!"" 

He said Turkey was hosting close to 2 million refugees, in contrast to about 200,000 in total being hosted by ""many times more"" prosperous Western countries.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has renewed her call for binding quotas to spread out tens of thousands of migrants among the European Union's 28 countries. 

During a visit to Switzerland, Merkel said she discussed the issue with French President Francois Hollande on Thursday morning. She said they agree that ""for those who need protection ... we need binding quotas within the European Union to share the task."" 

She stressed that a country's size and economic strength will be taken into account ""but otherwise we will not cope with this question."" 

Germany has taken in more migrants than any other European Union country. It expects 800,000 new arrivals this year.

1340 GMT 

German Chancellor Angela Merkel says the refugee influx ""is a problem that concerns us all in Europe"" and says her country is doing what is morally necessary. 

Merkel was asked Thursday during a visit to Switzerland whether she shared the Hungarian prime minister's opinion that the influx is Germany's problem. 

Merkel said: ""Germany is doing what is morally and legally necessary, no more and no less."" She said Hungary is right to say that the EU's borders have to be better protected and migrants registered ""but of course that's not the end of it."" 

She added: ""There's also an obligation to give protection to those who deserve protection. And the Geneva Convention on refugees applies not just in Germany, but in every European member.""

Greece's caretaker government says its coast guard has been rescuing hundreds of migrants from the sea every day — sometimes over 1,000 in one day — despite a severe scarcity of resources. 

Alternate Economy Minister Christos Zois said Thursday that 36 percent of the Greek coast guard's 240 vessels were not operational, as were four of its seven aircraft. Only one of its six helicopters is able to fly. 

Zois said the coast guard was facing difficulties finding funding and spare parts. 

Greece has been in the grip of a deep financial crisis for the past five years that has wiped out a quarter of its economy. Successive governments have imposed spending cuts across the board, leaving many state services struggling. 

-- 

1315 GMT: 

Financially strapped Greece says it needs more than 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) to deal with the current migrant crisis. 

The estimate was given Thursday by the country's caretaker economy minister, Nikos Christodoulakis. Greece says it has seen over 230,000 migrants enter the country this year, most coming by sea to its eastern islands. 

He said for now Greece is completing procedures to get money from nine different European funds, seeking 400 million euros ($445 million) from the asylum fund and 330 million euros ($367 million) from a fund for the poor.

Canadian Immigration Minister Chris Alexander says the tragic photo of young Aylan Kurdi, a 3-year-old Syrian boy who drowned off the coast of Turkey along with his mother and brother ""broke hearts around the world."" 

The boy's aunt in Vancouver had applied to sponsor the family, but the application was rejected by Canadian authorities. 

Alexander says ""Like all Canadians, I was deeply saddened by that image and of the many other images of the plight of the Syrian and Iraqi migrants fleeing persecution at the hands of ISIS."" 

He said Canada has one of the most generous per capita immigration and refugee resettlement programs in the world, and was planning to accept 23,000 Iraqis refugees and 11,300 Syrians.

1245 GMT 

Canada's immigration minister is suspending his re-election campaign to travel to Ottawa and look into why the Canada government rejected a request to take in the Syrian family whose mother and two young sons drowned this week trying to get to Europe. 

A senior government official said Chris Alexander's priority ""is to ascertain the facts of the case."" 

The photo of a 3-year-old boy who washed up on a beach in Turkey has galvanized a worldwide debate about migration. 

A Canadian legislator says he had submitted a request on behalf on the boys' aunt, who had wanted to bring the family to Canada, but was turned down by Canadian immigration officials.

1235 GMT 

A senior ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel is rejecting the Hungarian prime minister's assertion that the migrant influx is a German problem. 

Prime Minister Viktor Orban said the problem is Germany's because so many migrants want to go there. But in Berlin, Volker Kauder, the parliamentary caucus leader of Merkel's conservative bloc, noted that European Union rules say migrants are supposed to be registered in the first EU country where they arrive — and then stay there. 

Kauder says ""where people want to go is one thing, but they are registered and they are supposed to stay where they arrive in a safe country in Europe.""

Scuffles have broken out at the train station in the Hungarian town of Bicske between migrants and police in riot gear. 

Several hundred migrants excitedly packed into Thursday's first train leaving the Budapest train station, hoping to reach Austria. But when the train stopped on a police-packed platform at Bicske, which hosts a major refugee camp, disappointed migrants started chanting ""No camp!"" and refused to leave the train as police ordered. 

Several hundred migrants have remained on or beside the idling train at Bicske for hours. Police have distributed water, but many migrants have refused it or thrown it back, fearing it could contain sedatives. 

In Budapest, thousands of migrants remain camped out at Keleti, the main train station. Few agreed to board another train to northwest Hungary, fearing they too will run into another wall of police.

1135 GMT 

The president of the 28-nation European Union is calling for countries to share the burden of taking in at least 100,000 asylum-seekers arriving in the nations hardest hit by the migrant influx: Greece, Italy and Hungary. 

European Council President Donald Tusk said Thursday that the ""fair distribution of at least 100,000 migrants among the EU states is what in fact we need."" 

He warned if EU ""leaders do not demonstrate goodwill, solidarity will become an empty slogan and will be replaced by political blackmail, divisions and a new blame game."" 

EU leaders promised in June to share 40,000 migrants arriving in Greece and Italy, but the controversial plan is at a standstill amid bickering over how people should be distributed. Many European nations are reluctant to take in more migrants.

1125 GMT 

A Greek minister says over 230,000 migrants have arrived in Greece in the first eight months of this year, compared to roughly 17,500 in the same eight months last year. 

Christos Zois, the caretaker minister for the merchant marine, said 80 percent of those arriving were refugees. The migrant arrivals in just July and August alone surpassed 157,000, he said. 

The country's caretaker government — in power until Greece holds an early election on Sept. 20 — is announcing immediate measures in order to tackle the refugee crisis that has overwhelmed its eastern Aegean islands and northern border with Macedonia. 

Zois said authorities have received information that there could be millions more refugees waiting to cross toward Europe through Greece. The vast majority of refugees do not want to remain in financially stricken Greece and head north to more prosperous European countries.

1110 GMT 

French President Francois Hollande is calling an emergency meeting of top government officials to address Europe's migrant crisis. 

Among others, the meeting Thursday afternoon will include Prime Minister Manuel Valls, who earlier in the day had called for urgent solutions for Europe's migrant crisis. 

French public opinion appeared divided over the summer on whether to take in more migrants, but the government is under increasing pressure to help resolve the Europe-wide issue. 

Germany expects to take in over 800,000 asylum-seekers this year, the most in Europe, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged other EU nations to take in more migrants.

Turkey's state-run news agency says police have detained four suspected human smugglers a day after 12 migrants drowned while trying to reach a Greek island. 

The dead migrants included a 3-year-old boy whose body washed up on a beach, galvanizing a worldwide debate about migration. 

The Anadolu Agency said organized crime police detained the suspects, including at least one Syrian citizen, on a beach on Turkey's Bodrum peninsula. They were sent to a court Thursday to face charges. Anadolu said the four were suspected of acting as intermediaries for illegal migrant crossings. 

The 12 migrants drowned when two boats carrying them from Bodrum to the Greek island of Kos capsized on Wednesday.

Serbia's prime minister has warned of ""huge problems"" with migrants once Hungary's deploys military on its southern border with Serbia as part of a bid to stem the influx — and urged the European Union to come up with a plan before that happens. 

Prime Minister Aleksander Vucic said Thursday that ""no one knows what will happen"" after Sept. 15, when Hungary's new measures against migrants and human traffickers take effect. 

Vucic says Serbia is ready to share its part of the burden but ""we need to hear what would be that comprehensive solution.""

1030 GMT 

The Czech Republic is releasing 230 Syrians who have been detained in migrant centers. The move comes a day after Czech authorities announced they no longer intended to prevent Syrians who had already claimed asylum in Hungary from traveling via its territory to Germany. 

The Czechs previously had detained Syrian migrants, as well as those from other nations, for up to 42 days. The new policy could allow Syrian migrants to travel more freely to Berlin because the most direct Hungarian trains to Germany's capital pass through the Czech Republic.

Prime Minister Viktor Orban says he plans to deploy the military as part of a crackdown on migrants and human traffickers in coming weeks and blames Germany for the influx through his country. 

Arriving in Brussels for talks about the crisis, Orban said the Hungarian parliament is pushing through new measures ""that will create a new legal situation at the borders, even more strict than it was."" 

Asked by The Associated Press whether the military will be deployed to defend Hungary's borders, he said: ""Yes."" 

Orban said in Brussels that the migrant ""problem is not a European problem, the problem is a German problem, nobody would like to stay in Hungary.""

Czech police say they have stopped marking the arms of migrants with numbers — a practice reminiscent of the Holocaust. 

Police on Tuesday marked arms after they detained more than 200 people, mostly Syrians, in Breclav who arrived on trains from Hungary and Austria in Germany-bound trains. 

Spokeswoman Katerina Rendlova defended the practice, saying it was used in a chaotic situation to prevent children from being separated from mothers. Rendlova says police initially gave them the numbers on a piece of paper but the migrants threw them away. 

Rendlova said Thursday police will use wristbands instead. 

Klara Holikova from the Association for Integration and Migration commended the change but said the major problem is that migrants are detained at all.

Greece's coast guard says it has rescued hundreds of migrants or refugees at sea as they attempted to reach Greek islands clandestinely from the nearby Turkish coast. 

The coast guard says it had picked up 751 people in 19 incidents between Wednesday morning and Thursday morning off the coasts of the islands of Lesbos, Samos, Agathonissi, Farmakonissi, Kalymnos and Symi. The figures do not include the hundreds more who reach the islands' shores each day. 

With its massive coastline and proximity of its islands to the Turkish coast, Greece is the main point of entry into the European Union for a stream of people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and parts of Asia.

2585,"What the ACT politicians said, including the man who backed Tony Abbott to the end. Liberal senator Zed Seselja is ""very disappointed"" the leader he loyally served, Tony Abbott, was toppled by Malcolm Turnbull on Monday night and says the party should not forget its conservative supporters across the nation.

The ACT's only Liberal senator said he would ""back Tony Abbott 100 per cent"" going into the leadership challenge and on Tuesday was dealing with the setback of Mr Abbott's ousting and the prospect of the Liberal Party facing division.

""I'm very disappointed,"" Mr Seselja said.

""It's critically important that the Liberal Party continues to strongly represent conservative Australians.""

Senator Seselja had previously told media . At the time, he said those moving the spill motion did not represent a majority of Liberal MPs and senators.

But Liberal member for Eden-Monaro Peter Hendy supported the leadership change, voting for Mr Turnbull on Monday night.

""I thought the timing was an issue obviously, and there was a view taken by Malcolm and Julie Bishop that rather than see a very, very bad result in the Canning byelection... the time to act was yesterday and that's what happened,"" he said on ABC radio on Tuesday morning.

Mr Hendy said accusations that the Liberal's party right voted against Mr Turnbull were inaccurate, describing the right as ""splintered"" and Mr Turnbull's winning margin as ""very big"".

If Mr Hendy's bellwether seat was an indicator of political opinion across Australia, the tide was turning against Mr Abbott, he said.

""I was getting a lot of commentary from my constituents that the government needed to strengthen the strategy, particularly on the economy and particularly on explaining it to them and to Australians what we were doing,"" he said.

""I think Malcolm Turnbull, with his pre-parliamentary career, his time as a cabinet minister for many years, will strongly, strongly improve on that ability of the government.""

But Labor MP Andrew Leigh said Australia ""can't move beyond the current national paralysis"" while the Liberal Party remained in power.

""Malcolm Turnbull has said he supports 'every element' in the Liberals' two unfair budgets,"" Dr Leigh said.

""He has promised there will be no change to their ineffective climate policies, and no progress on critical social issues like marriage equality.

""So it makes no difference whether it's Tony Abbott or Malcolm Turnbull who leads the Liberals – it's their entire party that is holding Australia back.""

Dr Leigh swept aside suggestions Mr Turnbull's leadership would threaten Labor in the lead-up to the federal election while speaking on ABC radio Tuesday morning.

""If we can have a more sensible conversation about the future then I think that's terrific,"" he said.

""We're up for a policy-focused conversation. The question is whether Malcolm Turnbull is willing or able to move beyond the bad polices that have brought the Liberal Party to this point.""

Dr Leigh acknowledged Mr Turnbull was a good speaker but said he wouldn't tie himself to unreliable, ""horse race"" opinion polls.

""Malcolm Turnbull is a good speaker; I've said to him that he should have the permanent role as parliamentary eulogist,"" he said.

ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr said Mr Turnbull's ascendancy should herald in a time for ""serious progress on a number of key areas that impact upon Canberrans and the broader Australian public"".

""Primarily the Commonwealth's funding cuts to hospitals and schools,"" Mr Barr said.

""This was a broken promise by the Coalition that will have significant ramifications in the years to come.

""I hope Mr Turnbull will be willing to work closely with the state and territory leaders on reversing these decisions to ensure that all Australians continue to have access to quality public health and education.

""I would encourage Mr Turnbull to prioritise progress on reform of the Federation and a serious discussion on taxation reform.

""It's also crucial that the government tackles marriage equality and climate change – two areas in which Tony Abbott failed to take significant action in line with community expectations.

""The rollout of the National Broadband Network should also be a priority for a Turnbull government, especially to areas of Canberra that are experiencing poor internet service.""

ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr congratulated Mr Turnbull agreeing it was ""a very exciting time in Australia"".

""Our country needs strong leadership from the federal government, and I hope Mr Turnbull will bring this leadership and face some of the economic challenges the nation is experiencing,"" Mr Barr said.

Mr Barr said Mr Abbott's downfall was another example of the brutality of modern politics.

I also loved the wave design shown on the cover, which reminded me of Chinese and Japanese art. The size of the book means it is perfect for keeping in my desk drawer at work, so that I can use it to unwind at breaktimes and lunchtimes. However, I do find that I tend to get interrupted if I sit at my desk, so I've found a quiet spot I can escape to at lunchtimes if I want peace! Unfortunately there isn't space in my desk drawer for the huge box of coloured pencils shown here, either, I have to make do with a much smaller selection! There's a good variety of designs in the book, abstract, floral, teacups, a cat, waves, and much more! I did start colouring them in in the sequence they appear in the book, but then I started to just flick through the book and choose the pattern that most appealed to me that day.

2634,"We all like to think we’re gamblers at heart. 

You know it’s true. Whether it’s actually gambling — a friendly bet on the big game, the weekly lottery ticket, those trips to the casinos — or taking a risk in life, we all want to be seen as that bold adventurer. 

Clichés abound. “Nothing ventured, nothing gained.” — Anonymous “You’ll always miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.” — Wayne Gretzke “Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly.” — Robert F. Kennedy 
 
Of course, there are just as many sayings warning against gambling: “A fool and his money are soon parted.” — Anonymous “Gambling: The sure way of getting nothing for something.” Wilson Mizner “ And my favorite: “Horse sense is a good judgment, which keeps horses from betting on people.” 

In my younger days, one of my favorite pastimes was a road trip to Vegas. I fancied myself a bit of a Blackjack expert, even though I seldom won big. Okay, I usually lost. But I set myself a limit and quit when I lost that amount. Most of the time. 

I still go to Vegas, but now it’s for business or to take in the spectacle. The blackjack tables have gotten too pricey for me, and I do like to pretend that there is some skill involved in games I play, so slots hold no fascination. 

I admit to watching big money poker on television a time or two (when there wasn’t baseball, football, basketball, soccer, golf, tennis, etc. on ESPN), and now I have a bit of affinity for Texas Hold ‘Em. That’s the poker game of choice for poker tournaments. 

Now if you go to fundraisers, you know that one of the more popular attractions is a “casino” where you gamble play money to win play money, with the charity getting the real money. It’s a more active pastime than listening to speakers drone on, and it adds to the charity’s bottom line. 

Some of the more ambitious groups have tried to capitalize on poker’s popularity, and added a poker tournament to the mix. The leader in that regard is Rancho Los Alamitos, where a Texas Hold ‘Em tournament has been part of the Ranch Roundup fundraiser since day one. 

And yes, I have been sucked into that vortex. I have played every year. 

It started out as a charitable thing. I plunked down my money, took my cards, and after only a few hands got up and walked away empty-handed. 

But then there were a few players who, shall we say, enjoyed winning just a bit too much. The gleeful grin as I pushed my last few chips to the center of the table was more than I could handle. 
 
So I studied up and got serious. The last two years, I’ve made it to the final table. Last year, I finished fourth — just out of the money. 

Ironically — or not — last year’s winner wore that same gleeful grin as he flipped over his aces to beat my lowly threes. So you can bet I’ll be back at the table this Saturday night, hoping Lady Luck will be just a bit kinder to me. 

What does all this have to do with you? Well, you too can do some semi-serious gambling while supporting Rancho Los Alamitos. You don’t even have to decide to play until you get to the Rancho on Saturday evening — there will be day-of signups until 6 p.m. 

There will be plenty of other activities as well — auctions, a barbecue dinner, other casino games, western music and line dancing — but we both know the real attraction. Beating the guy with the gleeful grin. 

Go to www.rancholosalamitos.com for details and come on out. I bet you can’t beat me.",8ac32569-20d8-47bb-a288-c45624e8e908,News,2015-09-12T15:00:00Z,Gazettes Newspaper,Take Chance With Rancho Poker,0.0,News

Focus Verses: Genesis 24:26-27
26 Then the man bowed down and worshiped the LORD, 27 saying, ""Praise be to the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness to my master. As for me, the LORD has led me on the journey to the house of my master's relatives.""
Insight:
When the time came for Isaac to have a wife, Abraham sent his most trusted servant to find a wife from among the kinsmen Abraham had left behind. The servant was extremely faithful to Abraham. On his journey, he displayed responsibility, focus, honesty, and faith, and he was continually in prayer. God blessed his way and gave him success.
Response and Action:
I want to be a faithful servant—faithful to God and to others. I want to approach the tasks and responsibilities God has given me with a whole heart. I need to avoid distractions, pray continually, and be faithful and honest. I want to approach my days, my tasks, and my challenges with a prayerful attitude and with eyes ready to see how God is providing.
O Lord, help me to be a good steward of all you have given me. Grant me the wisdom and the will to guard my heart, feed my spirit, stimulate my mind, and care for my body. Help me, by faith, to do the good things you've prepared in advance for me to do. To be fruitful, faithful, and effective as a husband, father, son, brother, friend, neighbor, and co-worker. Through Christ, I pray. Amen.

 The plight of the actor-turned-director is an unpredictable one. The desire to tell your own story, direct and write or star in it (or sometimes take on all of those roles) is a attractive lure, and can turn out very well. But as Ryan Gosling learned at Cannes earlier this year with “ Lost River ,” ambition, if not matched by execution, can come at a steep critical cost. So credit to Chris Evans for keeping his goals modest with his directorial debut “ Before We Go ,” but unfortunately he can’t clear the low bar he sets for himself with this strained romantic drama that struggles desperately to be engaging, charming or relatable.  
 
READ MORE: Chris Evans On His Directorial Debut ‘Before We Go,’ Filming In New York, & ‘Avengers: Age Of Ultron’ 
 

  
Things kick off with a pretty decent meet cute: in a rush to grab the last train to Boston from Grand Central Station, Brooke ( Alice Eve ) drops and breaks her cell in front of busking jazz musician Nick (Chris Evans). She’s already gone before he can flag her down, but he gets another shot to return her mobile when, having missed the train, she comes back to the main terminal. It’s very late, and with the doors being closed for the night, both are forced outside. Sensing that she’s a bit adrift, Nick becomes the Captain America of chivalry, and upon learning her purse was stolen, which included her wallet and credit cards, he’s determined to help her get home. And so follows one night in Manhattan, with Brooke and Nick becoming drawn to each other, while harboring secret pains from their past, that will start being healed over the next few hours together. 
 
Evans clearly aspires to make a breezy and relatable, Richard Linklater -esque walk-and-talk movie, but lacks the skills to make it feel natural. The script for the 89-minute film is somehow credited to four different writers ( Ron Bass, Jen Smolka, Chris Shafer and Paul Vicknair ) which might explain why the film feels so clumsy and leaden as it contrives to keep the more sensible solutions to get Brooke to Boston out of reach. Not only are her resources gone, but conveniently, Nick’s cell phone has just run out of power, one credit card is overdrawn, the other is expired, and he’s got a limited amount of cash in his wallet. But one thing he does have in spades is resourcefulness. 
 

 
“I’ve got an idea,” Nick says a handful of times in the film. Eager to avoid a wedding reception where he’ll face an ex-girlfriend that’s still the love of his life, and with Brooke on a ticking clock to get back to Boston by 7 AM before her husband returns from a business trip at 8 AM (for reasons revealed later), Nick openly says he wants to be a hero and does everything he can, within his meagre means, to make that happen. But it really leads to a series of not very amusing or appealing misadventures, designed to force Nick and Brooke to face the problems they are trying to put behind them or ignore, while also realizing the future may lie with each other. 
 
“ Before Sunrise ” is an obvious touchstone and influence on “Before We Go,” right down to a running device involving pretend phone calls (except Nick and Brooke call their past selves), but it severely lacks that film’s heart and soul. What made Linklater’s film(s) work so well, and the characters feel so real, was that we learned everything about them. Celine and Jesse’s journey through Vienna was partially about escaping their respective breakups, but their discussions centered on all the things people connect over—love, life, religion, philosophy—and made them complex, compelling people you wanted to spend time with and know more about. By contrast, Brooke and Nick are not even half as interesting. “Before We Go” is like going on a date with someone who only talks about their ex; indeed, much of Brooke and Nick’s time together is spent focused on people who have hurt them, so when we’re supposed to believe during the third act that they are being drawn to each other, it’s a bit mysterious why they find each other interesting, beyond having a mutual shoulder to cry on. Their passions, motivations, dreams and thoughts never surface to help suggest why there is something more to their brief nighttime odyssey.

But one thing they do talk about a lot is love and fate, fighting for love and finding love. And it’s here where the movie, without spoiling anything, is curiously old-fashioned. Brooke in particular comes to a conclusion about what she needs to do about her marriage that is not the empowering or romantic notion the screenwriters might think it is, but that may also be because the details of what’s happening between her and her husband are also both cliché and underdeveloped.  
 
Meanwhile, when the script isn’t working, Evans turns towards the soundtrack and leans on indie rock when he can (and when the low-budget picture can afford it) to attempt to do some of the emotional lifting. But when those cuts includes overused or outdated choices like “Song For Zula” by Phosphorescent (see also “ The Amazing Spider-Man 2 ” and “ The Spectacular Now “) and Bloc Party ‘s “So Here We Are” (used on “ One Tree Hill ” twice, Katherine Heigl ‘s “ 27 Dresses “), not to mention a closing credit song by omnipresent soundtrack emotional shorthand Bon Iver . And it’s even more frustrating because the snatches of score by Chris Westlake , when used, are actually quite good and more effective than the safe indie rock selections. 
 

  
The final indignity committed by “Before We Go” is setting a movie in Manhattan that looks like it could’ve taken place anywhere. For a city that is alive late at night like no other, and offers endless possibilities for unique places for these characters to go, the screenwriters and Evans (perhaps due to budgetary reasons) keep most of the action on anonymous streets, and even less familiar bars (though hey, Cup And Saucer). We’re not sure who was doing the second unit work, but someone should’ve provided them with a tripod as the shots of the New York City skyline look mistakenly shaky, and we’re pretty certain it had nothing to do with the digital projection. 
 
If there is anything Chris Evans can take away from “Before We Go,” it would be to treat the film as a tremendous learning experience. Making a good film requires more than simply aping the structure and superficial qualities of better movies, and that there is much to be learned by digging deeper into the technical and emotional mechanics of what makes them work. Otherwise, you end up with an effort like this: a movie so firmly convinced it has all the moving parts, it never investigates whether they work well together. While Nick and Brooke might walk away from the evening wondering if those few hours together stoked something that’s real, for the audience, those 89 minutes will feel like an eternity that they’ll be ready to be divorced from.

Mandatory Credit: FightingIllini.com The Illinois football team is entering the 2015 season with expectations that have been lowered by many because of recent issues that have gone on in the program.  Well, some people like me expect a lot more out of the Illini this year. Illinois isn’t bringing back their head coach from last season, but they are bringing back the same team. Wes Lunt will be under center again this season and hopefully he will be able to stay healthy.  Josh Ferguson is once again starting at running back.  He seems like he has been around since 1902.  Illinois is bringing back the same wide receiving core from last year as well.

The defense hasn’t changed much either.  Mason Monheim will hold his familiar spot at middle linebacker, while the defensive line remains solid. The Illini also have their offensive coordinator from last season, Bill Cubit, leading the team onto the field this season.  He is taking over the duties and that is great because the team is already familiar with how he coaches. Some people may be looking down on Illinois this season, but what they don’t realize is how experienced and talented this team truly is.  They are a great group that has a great coach leading the way.  I look forward to the 2015 season.

This mother and daughter duo, Kayla and Georgina, are the ultimate BFF’s, to the point that they even want to look EXACTLY alike. 
 
Technically, not look like each other but more like their idol and British model “Kate Price.” 
 
“She’s perfect, she has the whole package, there’s just something about her,” Georgina, 38, said. 
 
This pair has invested more than $63,000 dollars on plastic surgery to achieve their dream of looking just like the celebrity. All the money has gone to enhance various parts of their body including getting breast implants, lip fillers, hair extensions, collagen injections, nail treatments, tooth whitening, Botox, permanent make-up and their tan! 
 
Kayla, the 20-year-old daughter, had began stripping at the age of 17 years old and a few months into stripping found herself a sugar daddy who would provide her with enough money to be able to get her and her mother Plastic Surgery. 
 
“I don’t mind Kayla having a sugar daddy or stripping to pay for plastic surgery because we’re living a dream!” Georgina, her mother, said. 
 
“We look how we want to look and we’re happy,” Kayla reiterated. 
 
It doesn’t end here. The duo plans to continue with the plastic surgeries and plan on getting a second butt transplant, nose job and breast augmentation. 
 
“Were not as close to looking to Kate Price as we’d like,” Kayla said.

2871,"LONDON — Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho conjured up American cowboy movies, fictitious fights in the dressing room and a statement of faith in struggling forward Eden Hazard as he prepared for Saturday’s clash with Arsenal. 

The two sides meet at Stamford Bridge for the Premier League’s showcase match of the weekend, with neither having made an ideal start to the season. 

Chelsea has taken only four points from five league games, amid speculation of problems in the dressing room and a disagreement between Mourinho and captain John Terry - a claim the manager has strongly denied. 
  
“I don’t have any problem with any one of my players,” Mourinho told reporters at the club’s training ground near Cobham, southwest of London. 

“Normally when bad results happen, the first thing that comes into your laptops, iPads and pens is to find a dramatic story: ‘Somebody punch somebody in the dressing room,’ ‘The manager doesn’t want to speak with this guy’. 

“‘Diego Costa fought with John Terry and before they start the fight they brought a translator for them to understand each other in the fight, because Diego cannot speak English and John cannot speak Spanish’... They organize like Far West duels - at this time we are going to fight, bring a translator to help us.” 
  
The reality, according to Mourinho, is much less dramatic. And has much more to do with the effects of poor results. 

“The other direction you (the media) don’t go is the direction which is real: you lose matches, you are affected, you lose confidence, you don’t want the ball.” 

However, despite its recent troubles, Chelsea will have been lifted by its 4-0 victory on Wednesday against Maccabi Tel-Aviv in the Champions League, despite Hazard missing an early penalty. 

Hazard, who helped Chelsea win the Premier League last season, certainly has the public backing of his coach as the gifted Belgium playmaker tries to rediscover his form. 
  
“He’s the best player in England,” Mourinho said. “He is the best and he will be the best again. I don’t know if it is tomorrow or if it is next week.” 

While Chelsea has failed to click, Arsenal clearly has a few problems of its own. 

Despite having a solid 10 points on the board, Arsene Wenger’s side has rarely looked really convincing this season and a re-shuffled team slumped to a 2-1 defeat away to Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League in midweek. 

Former Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech was on the bench, while Aaron Ramsey and Hector Bellerin and didn’t even make the trip to Croatia. 
 
 
  
“In football you have to forget cheap excuses and focus on what matters on the day, which is the performance on the day. If you want to make a career at a club without any disappointment, or individual disappointment, it is not possible,” Wenger said. “I believe you can repair what happened. We are on a good run in the Premier League and it is important now to look at that.” 

As if it were needed, adding further spice to Saturday’s game is the fact that the two managers clearly don’t get along. 

They squared up on the sidelines during Chelsea’s 2-0 win last season and there was no handshake between the pair following Arsenal’s 1-0 victory last month in the Community Shield at Wembley Stadium. 
  
Wenger brushed off the media scrutiny of his relationship with Mourinho, saying: “No special relationship is my worry. All I worry about is our performance tomorrow. 

“I respect everybody in the job and focus on what I love and that is football. All the rest honestly does not concern me much.” 

Wenger wasn’t concerned either by Chelsea’s poor start to the season. 

“It can happen,” he said. “Let’s not forget it is the start of the season and only five games have been played. 

“For us it is a big game and we know our position at the end of the season will depend on how well we do in the big games.”",55039afd-a094-4df2-b3b0-873c438f4eab,News,2015-09-18T07:01:00Z,Los Angeles Daily News,Mourinho denies locker room drama ahead of Chelsea-Arsenal clash,0.0,News

5787,"Do you feel insecure about your appearance? Do you wish you could change the way you look? No matter what you look like, there are plenty of things you can do to make yourself more beautiful. This article will provide you with some beauty tips that can make anyone look and feel better.Rub Vaseline on your cuticles once a week. This will help to keep your nails as healthy as possible during the day. It helps your nails and the skin around them to look shinier and healthier, too. It won't take long to see results, as this works on your nails almost instantly.Gently brush your lips with a soft toothbrush. This will help you remove dead skin cells from your lips and make them soft. You should then apply Vaseline or another type of lip balm to moisturize your lips and keep them soft. You can do this every day or every other day.You can adjust your hair's style and color to better accentuate the shape of your face. Seek cuts featuring long lines and that fall somewhere between the jawline and the shoulders. Use low-lights and highlights as appropriate to frame your face. Asking your hair dresser http://www.abimelec.com/epilation_laser.html - http://www.abimelec.com/epilation_laser.html - to include these special touches to your next hair appointment will make you look more beautiful.Exfoliate your face and neck at least 2 times a week. Exfoliating helps remove dead skin cells and bring new skin cells to the surface. This will make you look healthy and refreshed when you do this, but you should avoid doing it too much because it can irritate your face.Use a face mask at least once a week. Depending on which one you choose, this will help remove impurities from your face. A mud or clay mask is best for removing impurities. You will see results immediately. Once you find a mask you like, you should stick with it.If you have overly round eyes, you can elongate them by adjusting your eyeliner application. The outer two-thirds of your lower and upper lash lines should be lined with a dark brown liner. The two lines should meet at the outer corner of each eye. Finally, apply two coats of mascara to your outer upper lashes.Choose your eyeshadow based on your eye color to make your eye makeup really pop. If your eyes are blue, shades of brown are the most flattering. For brown eyes, try purple shadows like lavender or plum.

These will naturally cool and calm your eyes while lightening the skin underneath them. Take a pad that is made of soft cotton, dip it in the rosewater or cucumber juice and take a fifteen minute rest with the pad on your eyes.Improving beauty starts with improving your knowledge on how to take care of yourself.

The yellow helps to cancel out the purple, leaving a smooth palette for applying your foundation. A thin layer of creamy yellow concealer also makes a great primer layer for your eyeshadow, because it minimizes the appearance of capillaries and helps the shadow stick.Never ever apply a tanning lotion when you are in a hurry as this will always lead to disaster!

755,"ABU DHABI // Residents in some of the capital’s exclusive gated communities have expressed concern over what they claim are excessive charges for chilled water since a new utility billing company took over. 

In July, Al Zeina, Al Muneera, Al Bandar and other Al Raha beach communities had the company responsible for district cooling services changed from Dimarco to Tasleem. Both  charge users based on metered consumption of chilled water. Residents, however, are questioning a new “infrastructure service charge” that they claim has resulted in huge increases to their monthly bill. 
 
“In effect, this has increased our monthly chilled water charge by between 50 and 300 per cent,” said Briton M W, who has been living in Al Zeina for a year. “In my case, it’s a 132 per cent increase.” 

The 60-year-old was paying an average of Dh260 a month to Dimarco compared with the Dh600 a month he now pays to Tasleem. He said that 33 per cent of the amount was because of the infrastructure charge. 
 
“Without Tasleem’s infrastructure charge, it would still be a 35 per cent increase over Dimarco,” he said. “But with the warmer weather of late, I could accept this. I would liken this to staying in a hotel, then having my room rate doubled to cover hotel maintenance.” 

A Dutch tenant in Al Zeina said the charges should be based on consumption only. 

Her Tasleem bill amounted to Dh332 of which Dh44.09 was the metred usage. Dh288 was the infrastructure charge. 
 
“The more you use, the more you pay,” I S said. “Also, this would mean that clients that are environmentally conscious are better off.” 

An Al Muneera resident said he used to pay Dimarco between Dh1,000 and Dh1,200 a year for consumption charges on a three-bedroom apartment, with no fixed monthly fee. 

“We used to pay Dimarco Dh60 during the normally hot months and Dh150 during the hotter months,” said  A L, 40. 
 
“My bill for July was Dh354, Dh66 of which was for consumption and Dh288 for what they call the infrastructure service charge,” the Italian said. 

“It’s unbelievable. You cannot change the company name, provide the same service and ask four times more than what we were paying before.” 

Emirati A A, however, said he had experienced a drop in prices. “I have owned a villa in Al Raha Gardens since 2010 and in comparison to last year’s June/July bill of Dh1,800, I have seen it drop this year to Dh1,200.” 
 
A Tasleem spokesman said the infrastructure charge was “not an additional charge levied by the company, and had always been part of the overall cooling fees paid by consumers”. 

“Tasleem has separated the infrastructure service charge from the consumption charge to bring greater transparency to customers’ invoices,” he said. “The fee structure is a  standard industry practice, and is in line with global benchmarks.” 
 
Residents also complained of being required to pay a Dh3,000 deposit, 300 per cent more than that charged by Dimarco.

205,"NEW YORK , Sept. 17, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The Credit Suisse Research Institute today released a report entitled ""Fat: The New Health Paradigm"" which explores the influence of medical recommendations on fat consumption globally, the recent change in consumer perceptions of fat, and what impact this shift has for investors. 
  
While historically medical recommendations encouraged dramatically reducing consumption of saturated fats and cholesterol and placed no limits on polyunsaturated fats and carbohydrate intake, consumer buying patterns and medical research are now moving gradually away from these recommendations to favor food products with more natural unprocessed fats and rich in saturated and monounsaturated fats (organic dairy, grass-fed meats, natural oils, and nuts). The report illustrates this evolution by evaluating over 400 medical research papers and books written by academics and industry experts, and at the same time reveals the results of two proprietary surveys of doctors, nutritionists, and consumers. 
 
""We found that 40% of nutritionists and 70% of general practitioners surveyed believe that eating cholesterol-rich foods has damaging cardiovascular effects. This is not true, according to the extensive research that has become available in recent years. Furthermore, they have limited knowledge of the potential benefits and risks of increased fat consumption,"" said Giles Keating, Vice Chairman of Investment Strategy & Research and Deputy Global Chief Investment Officer for Private Banking & Wealth Management. ""There is a concerning knowledge gap between the facts on fat and what consumers have been told."" 
 
In spite of this, consumer purchasing habits reveal that consumers are making new choices, which presents powerful investment ideas: global consumption of butter is growing globally at a rate of 2-4% annually; whole milk sales are up 11% while skim milk sales are down 14% in the US in the last six months; and organic egg consumption in the US is up 21% in the last 12 months. The report shows that fat consumption will continue to grow over the next fifteen years with fat accounting for 31% of calorie intake by 2030, up from 26% currently. Saturated fat should account for 13% of all calorie intake by 2030, from just above 9% now. 
 
""We believe that consumers are at a turning point and this has distinct implications for investors. The report's conclusion is simple – natural unprocessed fats are healthy and are integral to transforming our society into one that focuses on developing and maintaining healthy individuals,"" said Stefano Natella, Global Head of Equity Research and an author of the study. 
 
Additional forecasts for macronutrient and fat-containing food consumption levels by 2030 include: 
 
GLOBAL 
 Fat consumption per capita is likely to soar by 23%, protein by 12%, and carbs will likely decline by 2%. Total demand for fat will be much higher—up 43% or 1.9% a year—given the 16% growth in the global population expected over the next fifteen years.  Within fat: Saturated fat is likely to grow from 9.4% in 2011 to 12.7% of daily energy intake and monounsaturated from 10.2% to 12.2%.  Polyunsaturated omega-6 is expected to decline slightly from 6% to 5.4% and omega-3 will grow from 0.50% to 0.55% (excluding supplements).   Carbohydrates will decline from 60% of global energy intake in 2011 to 55% by 2030. The rising awareness of the link between excess carbohydrate consumption and metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular issues will largely contribute to this decrease.  Red meat consumption is expected to grow 23% over the next fifteen years.  Egg consumption is expected to grow at a rate of 4% a year, as the cholesterol-heart link gradually disappears from people's minds. By 2030, the world could consume close to 300 eggs a year per capita (just over five eggs a week).  
REGIONAL 
 The US :  Meat consumption is forecasted to trend higher with red meat in the lead.  Egg consumption should be 350 per year (almost one a day) up from 235 currently.  Among solvent-extracted oils, a small decline is expected, with soybean oil still as the best-selling, including the new high-oleic versions.  Butter should grow faster as the market learns the benefits of eating butter and as negative perceptions linked to saturated fats gradually disappears.   Europe :  Red meat consumption per capita is expected to grow 9% and poultry 19%.  Fish consumption should grow slower at 12%, as consumption is already at a relative high level and availability is more constrained.  Milk, cheese and yogurt should expand 11% or 0.7% a year, but butter consumption should grow 4% a year. The 5.5 kg per capita expected for 2030 is almost 10% below consumption in 1990.  Egg consumption should increase sharply and expand by 42% or over 2% a year to 300 eggs a year per person.  Vegetable oil consumption on a per capita basis should remain basically flat.  Solvent-extracted oils should decline 10%, while natural oils (olive, palm, and coconut) should grow more than 30%, albeit from a small base.

 The rapidly changing retail market could favour independent health retailers and eco brands, a leading retail analyst has suggested.  
Martin Watkins, head of retail and business insights at analysts Nielsen, said there was “no going back” to the retail model that dominated the pre-internet era. 
 
Speaking at a recent Soil Association Trade briefing, Watkins said that the new landscape was characterized by features such as ‘Channel shifts’, ‘retailer disruption’, ‘small store shopping’, ‘digital and disloyal’, ‘low growth in FMCG’ and ‘spending less, saving less’. 
 
The single biggest change in retail, he said, was “the shift of spend away from large store formats”. That change in behaviour is boosting footfall on local high streets to the potential benefit of independents. 
 
Meanwhle, with an improving economic outlook, health has been rising up the consumer agenda. 60% of shoppers polled by Neilsen said they were “actively looking for healthier options” when food shopping, with 33% saying their main focus is “longevity and maintaining good health” (tellingly, in 2015 “reducing sugar intake” has replaced “getting my five-a-day” as consumers’ number one health priority). 
 
“34% would be willing to switch to a more environmentally friendly brand, and 23% to more a environmentally friendly retailer” 
 
Eco and organic brands are also likely to benefit from shoppers’ “wider ethical expectations”, says Nielsen. 67% of shoppers said they like to support local businesses and farmers, while 34% would be willing to switch to a more environmentally friendly brand, and 23% to more a environmentally friendly retailer.",d5f22844-432d-493d-98f7-6f2515f05797,Blog,2015-09-24T06:33:57Z,www.naturalproductsonline.co.uk,New retail landscape could favour health stores and eco brands,1.0,Blog
2242,"in BOLYWOOD / 					by / 					on September 28, 2015 at 8:47 am /  
Sriharikota (Andhra Pradesh) : India on Monday joined a select group of nations owning space observatory with the successful launch of ASTROSAT by its rocket, which also put into orbit six other foreign satellites. 
 
With the successful launch of ASTROSAT, India gained an entry into the select club of nations having its own space observatory after the US, Japan, Russia and Europe. 
 
Exactly at 10 a.m. the 44.4 metres tall weighing around 320 ton polar satellite launch vehicle's XL variant (PSLV-XL) blasted off the first launch pad at the rocket port here, around 80 km from Chennai. 
 
The PSLV-XL rocket with seven satellites cumulatively weighing 1,631 kg climbed up steadily gathering speed amidst the cheers of Indian space agency officials and the media team assembled here. 
 
The expendable rocket carried Rs.180 crore ASTROSAT, India's first dedicated multi-wavelength space observatory that will help in understanding the universe, and six other foreign satellites. 
 
While ASTROSAT with a five year life span weighed 1,513 kg, the six foreign satellites (four from the US and one each from Indonesia and Canada) together weighed 118 kg. 
 
Incidentally, this is the first time that an Indian rocket launched satellites from the US. 
 
According to an official of Antrix Corporation - the commercial arm of India Space Research Organisation (ISRO) - a deal has been signed to put into orbit nine American nano/micro satellites by the end of 2016. 
 
While four US satellites have been put into orbit on Monday, the remaining five would also piggy back on a bigger satellite later. 
 
At the mission control room, space scientists at Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) were glued to their computer screens watching the rocket escaping the earth's gravitational pull. 
 
Just over 22 minutes into the flight, the rocket slug ASTROSAT at an altitude of 650 km above the earth. 
 
Soon after, six other satellites were put into orbit and the whole mission ended in just over 25 minutes. 
 
For the third time a PSLV rocket has launched seven satellites in a single mission. In 2008, ISRO had launched 10 satellites in one go, including India's Cartosate-2A satellite. 
 
Immediately on the successfully ejection, scientists at the mission control centre were visibly relieved and started clapping happily. In the process India crossed the half century milestone when it its rocket injected the six foreign satellites successfully into their intended orbit. 
 
Till date, India has launched 45 foreign satellites for a fee. 
 
ISRO chairman A.S.Kiran Kumar described it as an ""eventful day"" and congratulated the entire ISRO team. 
 
P.Kunhi Krishnan, director, Satish Dhawan Space Centre, said: ""PSLV's success is continuous. Today it injected seven satellites in 
precise orbit."" 
 
However, it will not be right to call ASTROSAT as India's 'Hubble'. The Hubble owned and launched by the US in 1990 is 10 times heavier than the ASTROSAT and is said to cost $2.5 billion. 
 
While the Hubble space telescope is still working now, India's ASTROSAT's life span is five years. 
 
ASTROSAT, will observe the universe through optical, ultraviolet, low and high energy X-ray components of the electromagnetic spectrum, whereas most other scientific satellites are capable of observing through a narrow wavelength band. 
 
The five payloads/instruments of ASTROSAT are selected to facilitate deeper insight into the various astrophysical processes occurring in the various types of astronomical objects constituting our universe, ISRO said. 
 
The payloads are developed by different institutions-domestic and foreign- on their own or collaborating with ISRO. 
 
Of the five payloads, the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) is jointly developed by Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), Bengaluru and Inter University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) at Pune in collaboration with Canadian Space Agency and ISRO. 
 
This instrument can observe the sky in the visible near ultraviolet and far ultraviolet regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. 
 
The second payload Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter (LAXPC) is developed by Tata Institute for Fundamental Research TIFR), Mumbai and Raman Research Institute (RRI), Bengaluru. 
 
The third payload Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) is developed by TIFR in collaboration with the University of Leicester, UK and ISRO. 
 
The fourth payload Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager (CZTI) was developed by TIFR and IUCAA in collaboration with ISRO. 
 
And the fifth one Scanning Sky Monitor (SSM) was jointly developed by ISRO Satellite Centre at Bengaluru and IUCAA. 
 
The Indonesian 76 kg LAPAN-A2 is a micro-satellite from the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space, meant for providing maritime surveillance using automatic identification system (AIS), supporting Indonesian radio amateur communities for disaster mitigation and carrying out earth surveillance using video and digital camera. 
 
The 14 kg NLS-14 (Ev9) of Space Flight Laboratory, University of Toronto Institute for Advanced Studies, is also a maritime monitoring Canadian nano satellite using the next generation AIS. 
 
The remaining four LEMUR nano satellites from Spire Global Inc., San Francisco, US, are non-visual remote sensing satellites, focusing primarily on global maritime intelligence through vessel tracking via AIS and high-fidelity weather forecasting using GPS radio occultation technology, the ISRO said.

Robert T. Williamson, of Lafayette, the former private investigator at the center of a bribery scheme involving the Lafayette-area district attorney’s office, was sentenced Friday to six-and-a-half years in a federal prison. 

He must surrender to authorities by 2 p.m. Nov. 12. 

Williamson, 67, a former Rapides Parish resident, pleaded guilty June 8 to one count each of conspiracy to commit bribery, bribery involving a program that receives federal funds and Social Security fraud. 

U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Foote, prior to sentencing, said Williamson was the mastermind behind the bribery scheme, convincing and bribing five others with no prior criminal activity into participating. 

Between 2008 and 2012, Williamson paid three employees of the district attorney’s office to bypass the normal judicial process to quickly resolve cases for his clients. The cases involved mostly drunk driving offenses, but also drug cases and felony cases. 

He also bribed workers at a nonprofit and a driver’s education business to forge documents saying his clients completed community service and driver’s ed classes when they did not. 

Williamson was the subject of a 2001 Town Talk series about his disputes with law enforcement officials and insurance companies related to electrical shock injuries his wife, Sonya, suffered in 1989 at an Alexandria hotel. His wife, a Glenmora native, was left with debilitating injuries. 

Authorities were suspicious about Sonya’s injuries because of numerous previous insurance claims filed by members of the Williamson family, but doctors said Sonya’s injuries were real. 

In the Lafayette case, Williamson, who is not an attorney, was paid as much as $5,000 by his clients. 

On Friday, when Williamson’s attorney asked for a reduced sentence, claiming there was no victim, Foote disagreed. 

“The victim in this matter is the public trust,” she said. “And that’s far worse than if Mr. Williamson had simply stolen money from an individual.” 

Williamson addressed the court, saying, “I apologize to the community and the court ... I am greatly sorry for what I caused.” 

Thomas Damico, Williamson’s attorney, argued unsuccessfully for a lesser sentence, saying the scheme would not have happened without the cooperation of Barna Haynes, the long-time secretary to former district attorney Mike Harson. Haynes, 61, is serving 18 months in a federal prison after pleading guilty for her role in the conspiracy. 

The plot worked this way. Williamson paid Haynes to transfer cases from city court to district court, to fill out documents and to schedule his clients to appear before a judge outside of the normal court process. 

Greg Williams, the assistant district attorney who handled all of those cases, also accepted gifts and cash from Williamson. His secretary, Denease Curry, knew of the payments and failed to report the bribery. 

Williamson also paid Sandra Degeyter, an Acadiana Outreach Center employee, in cash and in-kind contributions to falsify certificates stating his clients completed court-ordered community service work when they had not. After Degeyter left the nonprofit, she allegedly split the bribes with Elaine Crump, who still worked at the outreach center. 

Williamson also paid Lawrence Bergeron of Safety Premiere Training to create false and fraudulent driver safety certificates.The federal government did not pursue charges against Bergeron. 

With the bribery system in place, Williamson’s clients were able to appear before a judge faster than through the normal court process and present “proof” that they completed the usual court-ordered community service work. As a result, they would never lose their driver’s license and their charge would be wiped off their record faster thanks to Haynes. 

The Social Security fraud charge against Williamson is because he received $77,677 in Social Security payments while claiming he had no income even though he was receiving income from the bribery scheme, federal officials claim. 

Haynes pleaded guilty in July to one count of conspiracy to commit bribery. She is serving 18 months in the Carswell Federal Medical Facility, a medium-security prison/medical facility in Fort Worth, Texas. 

Williams, 47, and Degeyter, 64, both pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bribery and were sentenced to two years probation and six months of home confinement. 

Curry, 49, and Crump, 62, both pleaded guilty to one count of misprision of a felony for failing to report the bribes. They were sentenced to two years probation and 200 hours of community service. 

The case was investigated by the FBI and Social Security Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys John Luke Waller and Robert Abendroth prosecuted the case.

But I, on the other hand, had been living in Taiwan, and I had to cross an ocean to get here, to where Bow would be born, and I could adopt him.
Shoko and Leben , two Israeli chimpanzees raised among humans Yesterday, I read about two chimpanzees who were born in Israel. and were raised by a human couple and then sent to Zambia when they were five years old. They are now thirty and doing well.
Shoko and Leben (named for the colors black and white as represented by chocolate milk and a dairy rich fermented milk, respectively)  were adopted because their chimpanzee mothers abandoned them. But why were they sent to Zambia at age five? And who was that other adult female that Jane Goodall brought to the wildlife preserve in Zambia at about the same time? Could it have been Lucy Temerlin? Fleetingly, the thought crossed my mind.  We know that Lucy was sent to Gambia, That's a totally different country in West Africa and not the same as Zambia, so probably not. But the thought briefly crossed my mind as I listened to the story. Lucy Temerlin died a tragic death  -- killed by poachers -- when her human parents, the Temerlins, sent her ""back to Africa"", though she had never been there and was Oklahoma born and bred.
Shoko and Leben and their adoptiveIsraeli parnts I think Israeli chimpanzees should stay in Israel, American chimpanzees should stay in America. And there ought to be chimpanzees the world over, because Africa is not a safe place for them. If we want to preserve chimpanzees from extinction, we should not send those born on other continents ""back to Africa.""  We should make sure they have good lives where they are, in touch with the people who raised them.
Yesterday, on my walk after lunch, I spotted a daisy.
 This is not the season for daisies, I thought, but there it was.
I almost made a poem: ""It is not the time for daisies at all, but this one is here even in fall."" I am including daisies as a plot element in the The Courtyard of the Happy Way, which is the second half of Our Lady of Kaifeng. Did you know that daisies are only partially edible, because they include a natural pesticide, but they are a great medicine, as this chemical is an antispasmodic and anti-tussive? I did not know that till yesterday. Daisies are even better than GMOs.
A bird flew over me on the way back to the house, and its silhouette hung for a moment over the sun.

2066,"Scientists now have a way to cloak something very small, making it effectively invisible. But what if scientists and engineers created a much larger version? What if we all had access to invisibility cloaks? A few days ago, a team at Berkeley published a paper called “An ultrathin invisibility skin cloak for visible light” in Science. It’s the first step in a long slog toward invisibility cloaks. But in this future, their discovery has become a gadget you can buy anywhere.
Advertisement The first person I talk to in this week’s episode is David Smith from Duke University, who works on these kinds of cloaking systems, also called “transformation optics.” In 2006, Smith and his team demonstrated that they could cloak something at microwave frequency. Since then, they’ve managed to cloak things using visible light. And this is all possible because of something called metamaterials—materials made from mixing a lot of different things together. To help explain what transformation optics and metamaterials are, I also talked to Ainissa Ramirez, a former professor of materials science and the author of a book called Newton’s Football. She explains the premise behind this whole “transformation optics” idea, which goes like this: Imagine a stone in a river. The water passes over the stone, moves around it, and then continues to flow on the other side. A little ways down from the stone, looking at the water you might have never known the stone was there. That’s what they’re trying to do with light, move it around an object and to the other side such that it appears to have moved in a straight line. That might seem simple, but it’s actually pretty complicated to do. Right now, scientists can only disappear very small things. And often, it’s only invisible if you look at it from the right direction, not all the way around. You see, to make a big invisibility cloak this way, there’s a pretty fundamental obstacle: the speed of light. If the object is big, scientists have to push light to travel faster than the speed of light — that way, it can get to the other side at the same time it would have if it passed right through the object.
Invisibility cloaks are a staple of science fiction and fantasy stories. Of course there’s the Harry Potter cloak, but Smith says that he thinks a different movie showed a more realistic version of what this might be like: Predator. In Predator, the alien can turn his invisibility mechanism on and off. But it requires a power source, and it’s not perfect. Smith says that if they do manage to build a bigger cloak, it will be more like that than like any kind of magical item. But since this podcast tends to be unconstrained by reality, let’s say that scientists could make invisibility cloaks. There are an endless number of ways people might use them: to spy on people, to hide things, to sneak around. Personally, I would use it to help with social anxiety at parties and conferences. When things get a little too overwhelming, I’d just slip it on and take a little break. We talk about a lot of other uses in the episode too. So with all these uses, how would this kind of technology be regulated? To answer that question, I called up Margot Kamisnki, a professor of law at Ohio State University. Kaminski says that actually some states have a law that might apply: in some places there are anti-mask laws on the books. So in New York for example, it’s illegal to wear a mask in public. An invisibility cloak would probably fall under the same umbrella. But anti-mask laws don’t always stand up to supreme court decisions. Kaminski explains how other decisions might impact our use of invisibility to do things like peacefully assemble. Now, invisibility cloaks aren’t coming any time soon. But the way we think about these cloaks is closely related to the way we think about privacy and anonymity today. How do you deal with anonymity on the internet? How do you regulate cameras in public spaces? Should you be notified when some company or person is watching you? In the episode we talk more about that, as well as some of the other ways the cloaks might be used, regulated and built. Have a listen!

1653,"Rick Perry is gone. Scott Walker is gone. It doesn't make a bit of difference. Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee this time around – unless it's Carly Fiorina or Ben Carson. The polls show that – it has come down to the bombastic real estate mogul and reality star, a guy who has never held elective office in life and with no experience in government, and the former CEO who had been fired in 2004 and never worked a day since, with no experience in government, and the retired neurosurgeon who's a little shaky on the Constitution and stuff. These three, combined, have the majority of the party behind them. Jeb Bush is polling at a bit less than five percent, for a reason – prior experience in elected office seems to be a disqualifier now, and everyone knows why. Most Republicans are seething with anger that their party let them down for eight years. Abortion is still legal. Obamacare is still the law of the land. Gays can get married now. Confederate flags came down. We didn't send a half a million troops to the Middle East to get rid of ISIS once and for all. We didn't get rid of Assad in Syria. We haven't stopped Vladimir Putin from doing anything and we're actually talking with the Cubans. And Mexicans are pouring across the border and murdering Americans left and right, and laughing at us. The list goes on and on. No Republican in office stood up and stopped any of this. That's the issue.

The other issue is noise. Donald Trump is an insult-machine. He specializes in Hispanics and women. Carly Fiorina is an acid-tongued ball-buster. One quip from her and Donald Trump is reduced to a limp stammering schoolboy. Her specialty is emasculation (and with Donald Trump that's a good thing). They go at each other day after day after day – no one can get a word in edgewise.

Ben Carson doesn't even try. He doesn't have to. While those two make all the noise, saying one outrageous thing after another, he's the quiet guy who is far more radical than either of them will ever be. That's why he's right up there with these two, while Jeb Bush and all the others have faded into the background. Those who are seething with anger that their party let them down for eight years, or maybe longer, sense this guy will actually blow everything up. Donald and Carly is the sideshow. He's the main event. He'll go where no one else dares.

Carson does skirt the edge:
Ben Carson is changing his position on whether Muslims are fit to be president. After sparking a controversy over the weekend by saying he doesn't think a Muslim should be in the White House, the Republican presidential contender said Tuesday that he is more interested in the president prioritizing the U.S. Constitution over his or her faith. ""I don't care what a person's religion beliefs are or religious heritage is,"" he said at a news conference in Sharonville, Ohio. ""If they embrace our Constitution and are willing to place that above their religious beliefs, I have no problem with that.""
That's a significant shift from Sunday when, during an appearance on ""Meet the Press,"" NBC's Chuck Todd asked Carson, ""Do you believe that Islam is consistent with the Constitution?""
""No, I do not,"" Carson responded. ""I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation. I absolutely would not agree with that.""
But Carson told an audience in Cedarville, Ohio, he was ""asked about who should be allowed to be President of the United States.""
""And I said I think anybody, regardless of their religion, if they are willing to embrace the values and principles of America and our Constitution and subject their beliefs to the Constitution,"" he said. ""I have no problem with that at all. And that's perfectly reasonable.""
The Washington Post's Chris Cillizza goes to the transcript. That's not how it happened, and Cillizza offers this:
When Carson says he is being misquoted or taken out of context, what he really seems to mean is that the words he used didn't convey the fullness of what he meant. Like, he meant to condemn Sharia law and radical Islam in that interview with Todd. But Todd isn't a mind-reader and shouldn't be. Carson's argument - ""Trust me, that's what I meant even if it's not what I said"" - is a tough one to swallow without any further proof of his intent.
Running for president is hard - especially if you, like Carson, have never run for any office before. You make mistakes; you say one thing and mean another. But, to refuse to acknowledge those mistakes - or at least try to deflect blame before acknowledging them - is the sort of stuff that hurts the political process in the long run.
Own up to what you say and/or what you believe. If you make a mistake, say it and explain what you really meant. Looking around for someone to blame is the stuff my six-year old does - and what I scold him for.
Cillizza knows better. Politics doesn't work that way:
In a post on Facebook on Monday night, Carson said a Muslim could serve as president if they disavow Sharia law in order to get his support.
""I could never support a candidate for president of the United States that was Muslim and had not renounced the central (tenet) of Islam: Sharia Law,"" he wrote. ""I know that there are many peaceful Muslims who do not adhere to these beliefs. But until these tenets are fully renounced ... I cannot advocate any Muslim candidate for President.""
He was back on track and more popular than ever:
On Monday, former neurosurgeon Ben Carson was bailed out of the controversy over his views of Islam by an unexpected ally. Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, called a news conference to ""ask Mr. Ben Carson to withdraw from the presidential race.""
The mild disrespect of calling a medical doctor ""mister"" was apparently unintentional, but the sheer audacity of CAIR's ask lit a fire on the right. CAIR, which plays a role in Islamic controversies similar to the one the Anti-Defamation League plays in Jewish ones, is not viewed that way by elements of the conservative movement. To many, like Center for Security Policy founder Frank Gaffney, it's viewed as a veritable fifth column that may be ""engaged in money-laundering foreign funds to pay for civilizational jihad here.""
So things went well for Carson:
Gaffney and others were reacting to more than Carson's stumbling interview with ""Meet the Press"" host Chuck Todd. In a subsequent interview with The Hill's Jon Easley, Carson had said that he had been talking not about Islam generally but about sharia law specifically. ""Obviously if a Muslim was running for president, there would be a lot more education about sharia, about taqiyya,"" he said, referring to Islam's term for concealing one's religion in the face of a credible threat. On the ""anti-sharia"" right, Carson was being railroaded.
""Let me help out these genius journalists, a.k.a. Democrats, a.k.a. liberals, a.k.a. know-nothings,"" snarked conservative radio host and author Mark Levin. ""There's a difference in Islam that does not apply to Judaism and Christianity and other religions. That is, sharia law is not just a governing law in your personal lives. It is a governing law. That's why in Saudi Arabia, they set up sharia courts.""
Ah, Carson was being railroaded. There are votes there, and Slate's Jim Newell notes this:
Carson's rival candidates sensed that the political novice had committed something in the ballpark of a gaffe. They attacked his position from different angles, many hoping to affix themselves to the outrage du jour to secure more attention for their own presidential efforts. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has about as much support in the presidential contest as you do, encouraged Carson to apologize to the ""American Muslim community"" and concluded ""that Mr. Carson may be a good doctor, but he is not ready to lead a great nation."" Sen. Ted Cruz hardly expressed a love for Islam, but he did note that Carson's approach is at odds with the spirit of the Constitution. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, as usual, submitted the most hilarious take thus far. In an unsolicited statement sent to the press that whines about how the press is always nagging candidates with questions, Jindal explained that he'd be fine with a Muslim president who submits to certain conditions, such as being sworn in on a Bible.
Carson and his team aren't sweating the modest rebukes from oxygen-deprived competitors.
Newell says Carson need not worry:
What's the simplest way to put this? The American public is broadly hostile to Islam, and the Republican base is especially hostile. Sure, we've had one GOP presidential candidate overtly defend the ""American Muslim community,"" but that was just Lindsey Graham - and the Republican base is hostile to Lindsey Graham, too. No one else, even the candidates who won't go so far as to affirm Carson's stance, is going to be seen hugging the neighborhood imam anytime soon.
For evidence of this hostility: Look around. A Huffington Post/YouGov survey conducted earlier this year found that only 21 percent of the American public has either a very or somewhat favorable opinion of Islam. Fifty-five percent has either a somewhat or very unfavorable opinion. Among Republicans, 13 percent has either a somewhat or very favorable opinion, while 76 percent has either a somewhat or very unfavorable opinion. (As with many surveys, one imagines the thought process here. Muslims, you ask? You bet I view them somewhat unfavorably!) A 2014 Pew survey found that Muslims were viewed even less favorably than the dreaded atheists; an Arab American institute from the same year found that 57 percent of Republicans ""doubt that Muslim-Americans or Arab-Americans would be able to perform in a government post without their ethnicity or religion affecting their work."" And not affecting their work in a good way, either.
And there's that other factor:
Forty-three percent of Republicans, per the most recent CNN poll, believe President Obama to be a Muslim. That's a lot of people. They believe that the country has already ""put a Muslim in the White House,"" and the experiment didn't turn out very well. President Obama, in their minds, was unable to perform his government job without his religion affecting his work. Why else would he agree to hand Iran nukes or take it easy on ISIS? Why would we ever put another Muslim in the White House?
Carson simply did what no one else would do, not even Trump or Fiorina:
Perhaps we should expect more from potential presidential nominees. Well, go ahead and try that; be sure to tell the rest of us how it works out. Carson's response was so obviously in his political self-interest that it only would've been surprising had he responded a different way.
Trump and Fiorina make all the noise, but Carson, the quiet man, will go places they wouldn't dare go. One shouldn't underestimate how appealing that is to the angry Republican base, and Jamelle Bouie notes how deceptive this is:
Ben Carson's brand is ""nice."" ""Carson has the bedside manner of the physician he is,"" says the Christian Science Monitor. ""Ben Carson doesn't shout,"" writes Adam C. Smith for the Tampa Bay Times. ""He doesn't throw zingers, and he rarely disparages rival presidential candidates. In a period when Donald Trump's bluster dominates the 2016 presidential race, Carson seldom says anything provocative enough to generate TV news coverage.""
They got it wrong:
The Council on American-Islamic Relations slammed the retired neurosurgeon, who with Donald Trump leads the Republican presidential pack. ""Mr. Carson clearly does not understand or care about the Constitution, which states that 'no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office,'"" said the group's national executive director in a statement.
The Carson campaign wouldn't budge. ""Mr. Carson has great respect for the Muslim community,"" said spokesman Doug Watts, ""but there is a huge gulf between the faith and practice of the Muslim faith, and our Constitution and American values."" Despite the reality of the American Muslim community, which is as loyal and patriotic as any group of Americans, Carson - the soft-spoken, genial doctor who runs on his religious faith - believes they are unqualified for high public office and that Islam is fundamentally incompatible with ""American values.""
But this isn't shocking. Of course Carson believes in the disloyalty of American Muslims. His genial reputation conceals a deep commitment to paranoid politics, honed over years of conservative activism and deployed in speeches, op-ed columns, and now a presidential campaign.
Bouie reviews the record:
At the Values Voter Summit in 2013, for example, he compared the Affordable Care Act - President Obama's signature health care law - to chattel slavery. ""You know Obamacare is really I think the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,"" said Carson in his remarks to the conservative gathering. ""It is slavery in a way because it is making all of us subservient to the government, and it was never about health care. It was about control.""
There's no question this is outrageous. But it pales next to the reactionary paranoia of much of his other rhetoric. ""I mean, our society is very much like Nazi Germany,"" he said last year, in a rant against ""political correctness."" ""You know, you had a government using its tools to intimidate the population. We now live in a society where people are afraid to say what they actually believe.""
If political correctness is akin to German fascism, then it's no shock the doctor thinks the IRS is a bona fide secret police. ""You know, we live in a Gestapo age, people don't realize it,"" he said, in reference to the federal tax agency. He believes that President Obama might suspend elections in 2016, that Democrats want immigrants to increase the welfare population and keep themselves in power, and that - as he explained in the first Republican presidential debate this year - Hillary Clinton and ""the progressive movement"" are ""trying to destroy this country"" by driving up the national debt and stepping ""off the stage as a world leader.""
This is beyond Trump and Fiorina:
Carson, the doctor, is a brilliant pediatric neurosurgeon. Carson, the candidate, is a crank - a creature of deep suspicion and conspiratorial thinking, who gives the mainstream a rare glimpse into the American Negative Zone of far-right fear and fetid fever dreams. There, anti-Muslim prejudice is common and unapologetic while Carson's claim - that Islam is inherently anti-American - is axiomatic. Given his political background, his remarks were typical, if not even expected. …
If his comments surprised, it's because of his style. Carson's gentle affect is his greatest asset; it soothes listeners and obscures the degree to which he's the most extreme candidate in the race. With that said, he's a Kessel Run away from the Republican nomination. Barring the catastrophic collapse of every other ""establishment"" or conventional candidate, he has little chance of becoming the GOP nominee, much less president. But that's no consolation.
That may not matter:
Right now, the top candidates in the Republican primary are a nativist demagogue and a right-wing paranoiac. They're channeling and emboldening the worst impulses in American politics, and winning the polls because of it. They will fall, but not before making a dangerous, and potentially enduring, mark on our politics.
And Bouie doesn't even mention Carly Fiorina, the new Queen of Mean. Leona Helmsley step aside. You didn't destroy Hewlett-Packard, lay off tens of thousands of Americans and send their jobs to Asia, and get rich. You went to jail. Carly Fiorina is running for president – but Ben Carson, the quiet man, is the sleeper here. He's not mean – bat-shit crazy maybe, but not mean.

There's another factor at play here too. Leah Wright Rigueur is an Assistant Professor of Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School and the author of The Loneliness of the Black Republican: Pragmatic Politics and the Pursuit of Power so she sees this:
That an African American that has never held political office is now a front-runner in the Republican primaries has surprised many observers. But his candidacy is perhaps less surprising if you consider two things: the long traditional of black conservatism in America, and how black Republicans like Carson have often appealed to largely white voters. …
African Americans are no strangers to conservatism. It crops up in the 19th and early 20th centuries, especially among black churches, despite their political radicalism. Conservative thinking was evident even in some of the most progressive civil rights leaders of the 1960s and 1970s. Even today, studies have shown that about a third of black people self-identify as conservative, although their conservatism rarely translates into support for the Republican Party.
nd this is how we make sense of Ben Carson. He comes from a long conservative tradition, one that is rooted in a belief in religious morality, personal responsibility, self-help, individualism and free-market enterprise, and one that sometimes exists outside the boundaries of partisanship. Some have attributed Carson's switch from ardent Democrat to conservative Republican as a matter of opportunism. That may very well be true, but Carson's book, Gifted Hands, indicates that he has long exhibited the kind of ""everyday black conservatism"" that defines a portion of black communities. … It's a rhetoric that conservative audiences, almost exclusively white, embrace.
Then there's the matter of race:
For white conservative audiences, Carson is ""safe."" His words on racism, for instance, while profoundly critical of racist acts, differ sharply from the words of black liberals. For Carson, racism is something to be changed through individual acts rather than something to be eradicated through structural change. Conservative voters can thus look at Carson and have their personal beliefs on race validated, especially because a black man is articulating these same beliefs.
He has all his bases covered. Ben Carson, not Donald Trump, may be the man of the moment. You have to watch out for the quiet ones. And yes, they're often dangerously crazy. But that's what the Republicans seem to want this time.",9662058b-fca5-4771-8058-c7fd7bd548a3,Blog,2015-09-23T04:00:00Z,Just Above Sunset,The Quiet Man,1.0,Blog

1559,"It seems every Republican you talk to or hear from is a Biblical scholar. Just about every letter you read in the newspaper is about someone’s religious beliefs or how sinful it is for women who become pregnant through rape or incest to abort. 
 
If you believe, as do Franklin Graham, Mike Huckabee and Pat Robertson, everything is an act of God or God’s will, why aren’t you angry about God aborting his own creations via miscarriages? 
 
As a Christian who doesn’t force anyone to share my beliefs or values, I can hardly believe God would be so careless with his creations as to create people attracted to the same sex and capable of loving one another. According to the Bible, the Lord came to Jeremiah saying: “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you.” 
 
If these are the words of God, why would he create someone attracted to the same sex knowing they would be living in sin? 
 
God gave us a free will. We are not programmed robots. Our strength does not come from within us, our strength comes from God through prayer.

Ramallah, Sep 7 (IANS) The Palestinian Foreign Ministry stressed on Sunday readiness to accommodate Palestinian refugees into the West Bank, particularly those fleeing war-torn Syria. 
 
The ministry said in a statement that ""despite limited and humble resources, we are ready to open all Palestinians' houses to welcome those who venture into a new refuge, or risk the unknown,"" Xinhua reported. 
 
It added that the Palestinians have the right to live in their homeland and not in exile or turning from one refugee camp to another. 
 
Meanwhile, Israeli politicians expressed opposing views on how Israel should handle the Syrian refugees' crisis. 
 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that while Israel has helped wounded Syrian in the past four years amid the Syrian civil war, it could not take in Syrian refugees into its territory. 
 
""Israel is not indifferent to the human tragedy of the refugees from Syria and Africa. but Israel is a small country, a very small country that lacks demographic and geographic depth,"" Netanyahu said in the weekly cabinet meeting, according to a statement issued by his office.

3100,"Stuart Lancaster praised England's try hero Mike Brown for lifting the team ""by the scruff of the neck"" to secure victory against Fiji - and a potentially crucial bonus point. 
 
The England head coach admitted however that the hosts will have to improve on their display in the opening match of the Rugby World Cup in their Pool A games against Wales and Australia. 
 
After an opening penalty try for England, Brown scored twice before Billy Vunipola crashed over for the fourth - and the bonus point - in the last play of the match. 
 
Lancaster, who described the atmosphere of the opening match as ""phenomenal"", said: ""I thought Browny was excellent. His ability to beat the first defender is a great trait and he inspires the team - he plays with such courage, pace and power. 
 
""He lifted the team by the scruff of the neck in the second half."" 
 
Lancaster admitted the introduction of replacements including Vunipola and his brother Mako, Owen Farrell and Sam Burgess had given England the final momentum - and put the substitutes in contention to start next weekend's meeting with Wales. 
 
He added: ""Yes I think they have. We always select one game at a time and the the bench really put their hands up and that's what you want them to do. With the quality of the team coming up against next week we need to be at our best and it's a big challenge against Wales. 
 
""The key messages are to play in the right areas of the field, trust the game will come to us and be more direct. We were too lateral in the first half and the players realised that. Billy, Mako and Sam came on and did well for us, provided quicker ball and that proved the difference in the end. 
 
""We need to improve, that's no doubt, but had we been offered four tries and the bonus point I would absolutely have taken that at the start of the game. 
   Promoted stories   
I think Fiji will cause every team problems. They play Australia next and then have an eight-day break before Wales."" 
 
Lancaster confirmed lock Geoff Parling had come off with an injury that was a ""mild stinger"" but that he would be fit for Wales. 
 
Fiji's head coach John McKee claimed England would have been disappointed with their display and would need to sharpen up for their big games with Wales and Australia. 
 
McKee said: ""We are a bit disappointed in the dressing room - we came here with high ambitions and felt we had England under pressure at times but critical turnovers and penalties allowed England to come back into the game and stopped us building any momentum.

New York, Sep 24 (IANS) As much as 47 percent of the edible US seafood supply is lost each year, mainly from consumer waste, new research suggests. 
 
""If we are told to eat significantly more seafood but the supply is severely threatened, it is critical and urgent to reduce waste of seafood,"" said study leader David Love, assistant scientist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, US. 
 
After compiling data from many sources, the researchers estimated the US edible seafood supply at approximately 2.1 billion kg (4.7 billion pounds) per year. 
 
Some of the edible seafood supply is wasted as it moves through the supply chain from hook or net to plate. 
 
The researchers found the greatest portion of seafood loss occurred at the level of consumers (51 to 63 percent of waste). 
 
Sixteen to 32 percent of waste is due to bycatch, while 13 to 16 percent is lost in distribution and retail operations. 
 
To illustrate the magnitude of the loss, the authors estimated this lost seafood could contain enough protein to fulfill the annual requirements for as many as 10 million men or 12 million women. 
 
Waste reduction has the potential to support increased seafood consumption without further stressing aquatic resources, said Roni Neff, assistant professor with the Bloomberg School of Public Health. 
 
The researchers offer several approaches to reduce seafood waste along the food chain from catch to consumer. 
 
Suggestions range from limiting the percent of bycatch that can be caught at the production level to packaging seafood into smaller portion sizes at the processing level to encouraging consumer purchases of frozen seafood. 
 
The findings were published in the journal Global Environmental Change.",6383b4c3-750c-44f6-809a-1009fa749b77,News,2015-09-24T10:36:06Z,Yahoo! India,Nearly half of US seafood supply goes waste,0.0,Blog

3720,"Android 6.0, known as ""Marshmallow"" is nearly here on Google Nexus devices yet only 21 percent of Androids currently run on Android 5.0, aka: Lollipop.
The figures are based on Google's own data; the company routinely tells developers the percentage of devices hitting the Google Play Store running on each Android version. The latest figures were taken over a 7-day period ending on September 7.
Here's how Apple will ensure your iPhone can fit the iOS 9 upgrade Read More The adoption rate for the latest Android software sorely lacks behind that of iOS, although with iOS 8 last year, Apple's own adoption rates were lower than in years past.
The main reason for the sluggish upgrade numbers was a lack of free space available on some iPhone models. Apple says it won't have that problem this time around with iOS 9.
While Google Play Services have helped mitigate Android's version fragmentation, it doesn't completely resolve the issue.
Numerous developers have reached out to me citing that they're still constrained by the new APIs Google introduces with each version of Android. Google Play Services can only help with that challenge so much, leaving developers to target more recent handsets with their apps. Perhaps that's another reason developer interest in iOS 9 is greatly on the rise in certain circles. Google expects to launch Android 6.0 later this year -- possibly later this month with a pair of Nexus handsets -- and the upgrade cycle will begin again.

1650,"It’s one of the most dismaying poll results I’ve seen: In October 2008, a month before they elected him president, 12 percent of Americans thought Barack Obama was Muslim.  Seven years later, now that they know him better, 29 percent have the religion of their president wrong. During those seven years, Obama has done nothing to indicate he is anything other than the practicing Christian he’s always said he was. It’s not that he’s become more Muslim. It’s that Americans have gotten more stupid. Some things are matters of fact, and technology has made it easier than ever to confirm facts. But instead of getting everyone on the same page, technology – email, the Web, social media – has accelerated the distribution of myths, caricatures, falsehoods and lies. Call it the Misinformation Age. Ignorance isn’t new, of course. Seven percent of Americans think Elvis is alive and the moon landing was a hoax. But the persistence of untruths in the political sphere, among people supposedly paying attention, is a problem on many levels. Obama’s biography isn’t the only example. Al Gore never said he invented the Internet, a lie that has dogged him for decades. The most recent Republican presidential debate offered several untruths: Carly Fiorina misidentifying a grisly video – and challenging others to go watch it; Donald Trump peddling long-discredited links between vaccinations and autism; Jeb Bush praising his brother George W because “he kept us safe” – as if someone else was president when terrorists struck on Sept. 11, 2001. But the myths about Obama have a special persistence, including the much-discussed and much debunked fact of where he was born. I’ll risk being obvious, because apparently 20 percent of Americans require it: Obama was born in Honolulu in 1961. We’ve seen his birth certificate, of course. But his birth was also announced in the newspapers. Faking a birth certificate is hard; it’s even harder to falsify newspaper pages that have been on microfilm for 50 years. As for the president’s religion, Obama has told his story, and it has been confirmed by reporters and biographers: The grandfather he never met converted from animism to Islam but was not devout. The father he barely knew was an atheist. His mother and the grandparents who raised him were Unitarian Protestants. His Indonesian stepfather was a non-practicing Muslim. Obama converted to Christianity in 1988 and joined a Protestant church. Settling some disputes require both evidence and definitions. In common American usage, your religion is what you were brought up as, or the faith you choose and follow as an adult, taking its oaths, celebrating its sacraments, honoring its scriptures, and attending its services. Both point to Obama’s Christianity. He was not raised a Muslim and there’s no evidence that he acts like a Muslim in his religious life. So by the common American definition, he’s a Christian, not a Muslim. Page 2 of 2 - I’ve heard theories that purport to prove Obama is a secret Muslim, using some other definition of religious identification. But redefinition cannot change a fact. Nor can repeating a lie over and over again make it the truth. Unless it’s a lie people want to believe is the truth. A lot of Republicans prefer the lie: A recent CNN poll found 43 percent of registered Republicans think Obama is a Muslim, and among supporters of Donald Trump, the number grows to 54 percent. “A lie will go round the world while truth is pulling its boots on,” wrote 19th century humorist C.H. Spurgeon, a quote often wrongly attributed to Mark Twain. Even faster, he might add today, if it comes with a note line screaming “Forward to all your friends!” Today’s lies come with Photoshopped images of Obama dressed like a Islamic scholar and mash-up videos labeled “Obama Admits He Is a Muslim!” They are peddled relentlessly by websites that have incorporated conspiracy-mongering and partisan libels into their business models. But they are just as false as the rumors spread by political enemies about every president since Washington. The truth is out there, provided by credible fact-checking organizations, but truth has always been optional in politics. Stephen Colbert had it right on his very first show, when he coined the term “truthiness” to describe things that may not be true, but that FEEL like they should be true. For 29 percent of American voters, truthiness is good enough. Rick Holmes writes for GateHouse Media and the MetroWest Daily News. He can be reached at rholmes@wickedlocal.com.

708,"Dear students,
the following posts were chosen best, since they were most interesting to read, demonstrated  pain and effort and... were in accordance with the actual task (unfortunately, some of you somehow got the task wrong and commented on GM food instead - I appreciate your work either way ;-). 1. Do you know what you consist of?
Our genes make us who we are, determine what we look like and even  what our children may look like.
Genes can control behaviour, physical abilities or diseases which reveals the power of such little information in our cells.
So the next time you eat an perfectly shaped red apple you should question where it's perfection comes from. You maybe wonder what food has to do with genes but If I tell you that 90% of groceries in a supermarket are genetically modified then you got the clue!  Cloning animals or foreseeing deseases is only the beginning of an era where changing genetic information becomes a children's game. This leads to the hearing that took place on Friday the 28th of August where a lot of experts of the topic ""genetically modified food"" gathered together in the GBG to discuss advantages and disadvantages of GM Food.  While the representatives of the church tried to make up every negative aspect that could one ever think of, the International Farmer Association brought up convincing arguments regarding to the risk of losing their work and business.  Furthermore the farmes explained the risks of genetically modified food like the ignorance about the aftermaths that this food could bring along since there isn't enough research on it.  On the other side the invited scientists and gen food producers, that among other inventions, invented the fish tomatoe, showed the audience the positive aspects gen food brings along. For instance the easy reproduction or cloning of food by producing seeds which would decrease the number of people starving in third world countries. Other than that gen food helps fighting allergic reactions towards fruits and vegetables.  A mixture of different tastes, fruits or vegetables would also be possible and the variety in supermarkets would increase.  All in all, the hearing was a success and a battle between ethical conventions and modern beliefs which cannot be united all the time but where can be found compromises. by Merve 2. Hey, guys! 
So today's blog post is about a hearing on the relevance of genetically modified food we had with my class on Friday, hope you like it! The idea was to divide our class into different groups and give every student a role they had to take on. So everyone had a role with a special opinion, and no matter what opinion they actually had, they had to support the opinion given with the role they got. I played the role of cardinal Onori - a strict Catholic and member of the Catholic church - obviously against genetic engineering due to moral und religious reasons. Although I am not completely against genetic engineering, as long as it is not damaging to our health, I had to act like I was against it and find reasons for that. Besides my group, there was also a scientists group, a GM Food group and a farmers group.  We also had some journalists who were supposed to ask questions to our groups.  The task was to create convincing posters and issue a statement. After that, we had to answer the questions of the critical journalists. So my group of two - the catholic group - of course stated that genetic engineering is a sin , because only god has the right to change things. To convince the audience about that, we read out an excerpt from the holy bible, in order to show that god did not want us to manipulate his creations. The scientists' group showed us a genetically manipulated tomato, made out of fish, in order to make tomatoes edible for allergy sufferers. Their strongest argument was the fact that tomatoes could grow in several sizes, packed with a lot of nutrients, even more than a natural tomato has. But the main reason was obviously the money they earn out of that.  The GM Food group presented several reasons on why genetically manipulated food is important for our society, and how it could possibly save third world countries. The farmers groups goal was obviously to gain compassion. Their argument was that genetically manipulated food might make them lose their jobs, because GM Food is way cheaper than biologically planted food, so the majority nourishes themselves with GM Food.  The seeds for the plants are way too expensive and there is going to be a time, where they just can not afford them anymore.  The journalists were really critical, they questioned everything we stated and this gave the entire hearing a nice touch and made it even more funny to take on roles. I thought that it was really nice and funny to take on another role, although it is not really my personal opinion, it was a lot of fun to act like I am a strict catholic, praying to god that this has to stop or we are all going to hell haha.  Now to my real opinion, I really do not see a big problem with genetically modified food, as long as everything positive they say about it is real, but the problem is, that we can never be sure if this has damaging causes after years of consuming it. I guess just because I was born eating genetically modified food, I just got so used to it, that I am not really concerned about the causes.  One thing that I just experienced with living in a country full of genetically modified food was that I actually think that tomatoes in Iran, my home country, look and taste different than tomatoes in Germany. They do not modify their tomatoes so I have to admit that I only eat them there because they just taste so good. Tomatoes in Germany just look perfect, but they are not nearly as tasty as the ones in Iran.  All in all, there is only left to say, that the lesson on Friday was really fun and that we should do that more often. We were laughing, but also we were learning about the different aspects and views of this topic. Moreover, I honestly have to admit that I think that GM Food will always have its benefits, but also negative sides, so I could discuss that for hours and never come to a conclusion by Sheyda Delicious genetically modified food So last week we had an interesting hearing in our class and discussed the question: Should we allow GM food in our supermarkets in Germany? Before the discussion, 95% of the class were against it, because it is a health risk and so on.The funny thing is that after the discussion we were not so stable in our opinion anymore, but why did it change? Firstly, everyone of us got a role which we needed to play, so if you had bad luck you got a role with another opinion than yours, for example me. Joking aside I believe that it is better to see things from another point of view and to learn new things. Before the discussion I always connected GM food with something unnecessary, chemical and disgusting, but after I read all the advantages of this GM food, for instance it could help to prevent the hunger in the third world, we could modify tomatoes to grow in a new geographical zone so they can plant them and eat them, it could be a help for our world and society. But on the other hand the people are not always open-minded as to such things especially if they eat modified food and do not know what is in it. It is a little bit scary, like the other groups mentioned (the Church) it is not normal and people should accept the thing we have in our environment. Moreover, we do not have long-time statistics which demonstrate us if GM food is not a health risk in the future and that with GM food no new problems like new illnesses or allergies arise. Another good point being mentioned was that many people will get jobless because GM seeds are cheaper and will grow faster and better, a normal farmer cannot afford such expensive things and will perish under the big companies. After looking at both views it is difficult to have a clear opinion on this topic.  I am undecided since it has many advantages and also many disadvantages, but the feeling that you do not eat real vegetables is a little bit too scary, Maybe in a few years when more statistics and tests are done on GM food I will change my mind, but for now I think it is better to use our normal resources and to find other ways to help the people in the third-world. The health of humans is far more important to me than the money the scientists can make with this idea. by Renata ",68c80656-7a06-4dfc-bcfe-a659bf20c492,Blog,2015-09-01T15:00:45Z,englischphilo,The 3 Winning posts: Last Friday`s Hearing on GM Food,1.0,News

This came on Thursday from Seoul's unification ministry that cited no big difference of vehicle circulation in the North and an increase of taxi companies.

803,"Below is an extract of another of Pete Davison’s excellent definition blogs. You can find the full version at angryjedi.wordpress.com / I’m Not Doctor Who Jud House 2056: Pete’s Probably Non-Comprehensive Visual Novel Primer
Pete Davison •#oneaday •4h ago
0056_001 I posted the following over on the Squadron of Shame forums the other day, since we were getting into a discussion on visual novels. I thought it might be of some interest to people who don’t frequent the Squawkbox, so I present it here in slightly extended format for your enjoyment and information. Pete’s Probably Non-Comprehensive Visual Novel Primer
What is a visual novel?
First things first, get out of the habit of thinking of a visual novel as a “game”, despite the fact that they’re typically sold as games, referred to as “games” and share a number of stylistic and mechanical elements with games. In Japanese popular culture, visual novels are treated as their own distinct medium, and in the pantheon of media which creators tell stories across, they comfortably sit alongside light novels, manga, anime, movies, live-action TV shows and, yes, video games. Transmedia productions often span several or even all of the above formats, and any one of them can prove the starting point for a successful franchise. The reason I mention visual novels’ distinction from traditional games is because visual novels very often don’t have any “gameplay” as such, and coming to them with the expectation that you will be “doing” anything is often a recipe for disappointment. There are exceptions of course, since some visual novels do incorporate “game” elements — notable examples include Aselia the Eternal’s extremely deep and satisfying strategy game and its spiritual successor Yumina the Ethereal’s dungeon-crawling and peculiar argument-based battle system — but for the most part, visual novels are about reading reams of text accompanied by some combination of art, music and voice acting. In other words, they’re a dedicated storytelling medium that occupies a peculiar space at the intersection between manga, anime and traditionally written prose. Danganronpa, Corpse Party and Ace Attorney are often described as visual novels due to their text-heavy nature and emphasis on linear storytelling, but there’s a strong argument that they are more adventure game than visual novel due to their balance between story and game being firmly in favour of “game”. Ultimately it doesn’t matter all that much; if you’re less than familiar with the visual novel medium as a whole, though, just don’t go in expecting to actually have any interaction whatsoever, and then you can only be pleasantly surprised if you do get to do something. The appeal of a visual novel is in the storytelling, not the interaction. Types of visual novel
The presentation of pure visual novels can be roughly broken down into two main types: NVL (“novel”) types fill the screen with text, usually in a semi-transparent box so you can see the artwork behind it, and read like a traditional novel. Examples of this type include Kana Little Sister and KiraKira.
ADV (“adventure”) types look more “gamey”, with a dialogue box at the bottom of the screen and a clear view of the art and characters. These tend to have a sharper demarcation between narration and dialogue, compared to NVL types, which will often mix both on a single screen of text. Examples of this type include Katawa Shoujo and The Fruit of Grisaia. This is probably the more common type we see in the West.
Visual novels can also be split into a couple of different categories according to structure: Kinetic novels have no choices whatsoever. You start them up, you read them, you reach the end. You have absolutely no interaction whatsoever — it’s a pure storytelling medium.
Multi-scenario visual novels are the more common type. Most of these start with a common route, then branch off in a number of different directions according to choices you make in the common route. Some further split the branches into other routes, not all of them necessarily ending well; others guarantee you a specific good ending once you lock in a particular route. Other useful terminology
Bad/Wrong/Dead End — an ending in which the protagonist and/or hero/heroine dies, usually. Not necessarily a “fail” state; if the story is a tragedy, there might be nothing but bad endings!
Good End — an ending in which everything resolves nicely and cleanly, and (usually) no-one dies.
True End — an ending which is treated as canonical for the purposes of sequels, whether or not sequels actually exist. True Ends are often inaccessible until you complete all the other routes.
Decision point — being presented with a choice. Not every choice in a visual novel has an impact on how the story ends out, but most don’t tell you one way or the other, and some don’t even allow you to save while a decision point is on screen, so choose wisely!
Clear — reading a visual novel to one of its conclusions.
Full/100% Clear — reading all of the possible routes to a visual novel, including bad endings, and unlocking all the bonus content.
Flag — hidden binary variables that are set and unset according to the choices that you make. The most commonly referenced is the “death flag”, where a choice you made will result in someone’s death, not necessarily immediately. Some visual novels use flags to determine which route you end up on.
Points/stats — other visual novels have hidden “stats” according to your choices, and use these to determine which route you end up on. Kana Little Sister is an example of this; the choices you make in the first half of the game determine the personality of the protagonist and his sister, and this determines how the latter half of the game plays out.
Skip — the ability to fast-forward through text you’ve already read. All but essential for subsequent playthroughs to get different routes, unless you really want to read all the same text again. Most visual novels stop skipping when they reach a decision point.
CG/event image — a piece of artwork that isn’t a character sprite overlaid on a background, usually depicting something significant happening. You are considered to have 100% cleared a visual novel when you have unlocked every CG in the game’s gallery page.
H-scene — pronounced “ecchi scene”, these are the erotic scenes in an eroge or nukige. * * *",dddfdf7a-2fce-4f35-adb4-321bbb38664e,Blog,2015-09-07T03:21:46Z,Jud's PC Game Reviews & Problem Solving,PETE'S PROBABLY NON-COMPREHENSIVE VISUAL NOVEL PRIMER,1.0,Blog

1057,"The Senate Spokesperson, Senator Dino Melaye, has on Wednesday disclosed that the senate is yet to receive President Muhammadu Buhari’s ministerial list as deadline looms. 
 
“We are still waiting for the ministerial list from the President. I want to advise that there is no need for agitation because September expires by midnight and the office of the Senate President is open, “ Melaye said. 
 
Meanwhile, reports from New York, where Buhari has been attending the UN General Assembly, quoted the president as saying he would be minister of petroleum resources, with a junior minister taking charge of day-to-day affairs in the sector. 
 
“Confirmed. He said so,” his spokesman Femi Adesina told AFP in a text message, without giving further details. 
 
Buhari’s caution in appointing ministers has seen him nicknamed “Baba Go Slow” in Nigeria, but he has promised to name his cabinet by Wednesday, Sept 30, 2015.

49,"Two Jersey City men armed with a handgun were arrested Wednesday afternoon and charged with a brazen daylight attack at a car wash, Jersey City spokeswoman Jennifer Morrill said. 
 
Jersey City Police responding to the report of an aggravated assault at a car wash on Broadway at around noon quickly identified and arrested the two men, and also recovered a loaded handgun and drugs, Morrill said. 
 
Johnny Rojas, 33, of Romaine Avenue, was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, terroristic threats, possession of a handgun, and numerous narcotics charges, including possession and possession with intent to distribute. 
 
Alexis Diaz, 33, of Duncan Avenue, was charged with possession of a handgun, terroristic threats, and numerous narcotics charges, including possession and possession with intent to distribute. 
 
The victim, a 26-year-old Griffith Street resident, told police two men approached him while he was washing a black SUV and asked him the whereabouts of his cousin, whom they claimed owed them money, Morrill said. 
 
Rojas and Diaz then attempted to punch the man, with Rojas lifting his shirt and showing a black handgun to the victim. The Griffith Street man then fled to the entrance of the business and called police, Morrill said. 
 
The man provided a description of his attackers to a police dispatcher, as well as the white Infiniti they fled the scene in. Plainclothes officers in the Street Crimes Unit who were working in the area, as well as West District patrol, responded to the Romaine Avenue address to which the vehicle was registered, Morrill. 
 
Police saw the vehicle parked at the home and eventually spotted Rojas and a third individual, Hector Poll-Ortiz, walking on Broadway. When officers approached the two men, they saw the handle of a handgun sticking out of Rojas' waistband, Morrill said. 
 
When one officer yelled ""gun,"" Rojas attempted to turn around and flee but was forced to the ground. A loaded, black Remington semi-automatic handgun was recovered from Rojas, who was also in possession of $468 in cash and the keys to the Infiniti, the spokeswoman said. 
 
Meanwhile, Diaz was spotted walking nearby with cuts on his hand. Due to the proximity of the crime location and the apprehension of Rojas, officers detained Diaz, who was later identified as the second attacker from the car wash. 
 
While the car was being impounded, officers found six bags of suspected CDS cocaine in the cup holder in the middle console, Morrill said. 
 
Poll-Ortiz, who was not charged in connection with the car wash attack, was arrested on an open Hudson County Sheriff's Office warrant and was turned over to that agency for processing, Morrill added.",2aeffe17-61cb-42a4-a533-de3ee204b813,News,2015-09-25T07:00:50Z,Jersey Journal,Cops quickly nab 2 men in Jersey City car wash attack,0.0,Blog
3053,"STANWAY ROVERS marched into the second qualifying round of the FA Cup thanks to a stunning 3-0 victory at home to Needham Market tonight. 
 
Angelo Harrop’s side were three-up at half-time, following an amazingly one-sided first half against their shell-shocked Ryman Premier opponents. 
 
Jake Clowsley slotted them into a ninth-minute lead, after Dan Heath’s goal-kick caused indecision between the Needham centre-halves. 
 
Craig Hughes then fired home from the penalty spot after a clear foul by Needham keeper Shaun Phillips. 
 
And Jordan Palmer steered home a right-wing delivery on the stroke of half-time to cap a dream first half for Stanway . 
 
Needham fielded a strong side that included former Colchester United heroes Kem Izzet and Karl Duguid. 
 
However, Rovers could have been four-up at the break as they also missed a golden chance earlier in the half. 
 
Ben Newson crossed from deep on the right but Jemal Fox headed back across goal and wide of the far post. 
 
Needham’s night went from bad to worse three minutes into the second half. 
 
Phillips was shown a straight red card for an off-the-ball incident and under-18s keeper Tyler Hursey had to replace the crestfallen former U’s youngster. 
 
The writing was on the wall for Needham and although they had spells of possession in the second half, they were unable to penetrate a well-organised Stanway defence. 
 
The Suffolk side were reduced to nine men in the closing stages when substitute Adam Mills was sent off for a foul on Clowsley.

1663,"Thousands of pounds of NHS cash is being spent on treats for patients, including  holidays, aromatherapy, new clothes and a summer house, according to an investigation. 
 
		 
Personal health budgets are being spent on activities such as horse riding, art classes, massage and personal trainers, Pulse magazine found. 
  Together with an NHS team or GP, patients can develop a care plan on how the money should be spent   
The budgets were introduced by the Government to allow people with long-term conditions and disabilities greater choice and control over the healthcare and support they receive. 

			 
Together with an NHS team or GP, patients develop a care plan on how the money should be spent. 



 
The pot of cash can be used to pay for a wide range of services, including therapies to help with depression, help with personal care such as dressing and washing, and equipment. 

The amount of money varies from person to person and depends on a patient's needs. 

Pulse used the Freedom of Information Act to find out how much was spent in 2014/15 on personal health budgets. 

Some 33 Clinical Commissioning Groups out of 209 in England provided full responses. 

			 
The NHS Nene Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) and the NHS Corby CCG, which handle health money for Northamptonshire, spent £2.55 million between them on personal health budgets for 161 patients. 

From this, some money was spent on a family holiday to allow a patient to ""re-establish relations"" with their children while another went on holiday with a dog. 

Cash was also spent on a satnav, new clothes, an iRobot cleaner and the construction of a summer house so one patient could have ""their own space"". 

Further money was spent on  hydrotherapy, shiatsu, Indian head massages, art classes and kitchen equipment, including a food processor. 

			 
A spokesman said the money was to achieve outcomes that ""focus on improving an individual's health and wellbeing."" 

He added: ""All personal health budgets are clinically agreed and monitored."" 

In Kernow in Cornwall, £267,000 was spent on five people, including £2,080 on aromatherapy, £248 on horse riding and just over £7 on hiring pedalos. 

A spokesman said ""We follow national guidance when agreeing personal health budgets."" 

The NHS Stoke on Trent CCG spent £114,000 between 115 patients, including money for a Wii Fit computer game and more than £1,000 on music lessons. 

			 
A spokesman said these were judged to help patients and ""represent excellent value for the NHS."" 

In Horsham, Crawley and coastal West Sussex, £2.6 million was spent on care packages for 44 people, the highest spend per patient of any of the CCGs. 

The 33 CCGs also submitted details to Pulse of their predicted spend on personal health budgets in 2015/16, with an expected spend of £589,000 each. 

Extrapolated across all CCGs, this would lead to a spend of more than £120 million on fewer than 5,000 patients. 

Dr Richard Vautrey, deputy chairman of the British Medical Association's General Practitioners Committee, said: 'We continue to have real reservations about this scheme and the inappropriate use of scarce NHS money on non-evidence-based therapies. 

""While individuals may themselves value a massage or summer house, others will understandably start to question why they can't also have such things paid for by the state - and that will just fuel demand."" 

Dr Vautrey said CCGs were always looking to ""penny-pinch"" in order to maintain current NHS services. 

He said a small loss of income could jeopardise a whole service. He added: ""This can have serious implications for large numbers of people just based on the whims of a small number.' 

A spokesman for NHS England said: ""Personal health budgets are designed to meet identified health needs in ways that give patients more control over the care and support they receive. 

""The spending must be agreed between the individual and the NHS, meet the patient's individual health needs and achieve the desired outcomes. 

""An independent evaluation has shown that personal health budgets are cost effective, help people manage their health and improve quality of life."" 

Research by Nick Watson, professor of health and wellbeing at the University of Glasgow, has found that patients who received the budgets had £4,000 more spent on them than others receiving usual care, irrespective of the complexity of their needs. 

He said: ""The policy fits the current rhetoric - it is very consumerist and individualistic. 

""Looking at the level of resourcing for the project and the evidence it has been based on, I would say it's at best spurious. I think we are going forward on poor evidence and there is a clear ideological drive behind it.""

2866,"Rick Ross Being SUED After His Associate ALLEGEDLY Drugged & Raped A Woman + Lira Galore’s Mother Addresses Rozay Cheating On Daughter by DatzHott on September 21, 2015 in Hott Culture Leave a comment Well…it looks like one of Rick Ross‘ associates has gotten him involved in some ish. And now a woman is SUING him for allegedly being drugged and raped. Meanwhile, Rozay’s possible mother-in-law is speaking out on her future son-in-law’s bedroom antics. And she has an interesting take on the matter. More inside…. When you make a track about drugging a female and having sex with her unbeknownst to her, you better get lawyered up because clearly someone will take your word for it…whether it’s true or not. Case in point: An anonymous woman has a filed a lawsuit against MMG honcho Rick Ross alleging that one of his associates drugged her, rapped her….and she “ain’t even know it” during GRAMMY weekend back in February. Here’s what TMZ is reporting: The woman — who is ID’d as Jane Doe in the lawsuit — claims she was at the W Hotel in L.A. where she met up with Rick and his entourage, who had invited her to go to Cannabis Cup … a weed convention.
She says she got in the van with Rick, a guy named Thaddeus “Black” James, a DJ, 3 security guards and the driver. She says she was offered a glass of booze and shortly thereafter became dizzy and eventually passed out. She says the next thing she knew, 2 hours had passed and she was in the van with Black. The woman says she went back to Black’s hotel room and passed out again. She woke up at 8 AM, examined herself and realized her clothes had been removed and she had been sexually assaulted. The woman believes Black is the one who raped her. Yikes! So why is she suing Rozay? Well she feels since the guy who allegedly violated her is Rozay’s agent and it supposedly happened on his van, she wants him to pay up too. Sighs…this all could be so easily avoided. In other Rozay news…. We told you Rick Ross might have popped the question to his girlfriend Lira Galore a few days ago. Chick didn’t waste any time to spread the word to the masses on her social media accounts. Yet, Ross still hasn’t confirmed or denied the news yet. But, Lira’s mother (above) seems super excited about the news letting one “fan” know that even IF the Bawse is cheating on her daughter, her baby is still winning. Oh? On Instagram, Lira’s mom happily posted: In the comments, a follower responded to her post saying, “But he still f*ckin’ my gf from Philly smh #fact guard your heart girl.” Yikes! Well, Momma Galore quickly clapped back, “lmfao he a celebrity of course that’s to be expected! Tf! U think we don’t know that? As long as ya home girl getting wet a** while my baby getting diamonds, his heart & treated like a queen in his palace then who winning tho boo? Where ur friends diamonds at?” Umm…thoughts?

446,"FORMER PM John Howard once described himself as ""Lazarus with a triple bypass"" for rising from the dead to reclaim the leadership of the Liberal Party. 

While I wouldn't put Labor's Janelle Saffin in the same category, her political comeback in Page was hardly surprising. 

She is set to challenge Kevin Hogan of the Nationals, who unceremoniously dumped her from the federal seat at the 2013 election. 

This is going to be a tight contest one way or another. 

Both parties will need to spend big bucks on election advertising. 

That's one area Hogan was streets ahead of Saffin in 2013 as the Nats were able to swing money they were going to spend on Barnaby Joyce's campaign in behind Hogan after Tony Windsor dropped out of the race in a neighbouring electorate. 

Saffin also suffered from Labor's toxic brand and dissatisfaction over leadership changes. She was one of Kevin Rudd's key supporters. 

Her job in booting Hogan out of her former seat would have been a whole lot easier a week or so ago when Tony Abbott was in power. 

Malcolm Turnbull has swung swinging voters in behind the Coalition again and now her path back to Page looks far from certain. 

Hogan hasn't done a bad job since taking up the reins. He's safe and steady and has ""saved"" a few things from the axe.

2669,"Michelle Rounds was rushed to the hospital Tuesday night after a concerned friend called police. She was released Wednesday afternoon An insider says that Rounds had 'taken pills and drank wine' after having a 'bitter argument' with her ex Rosie O'Donnell Police kicked down the door to Rounds' hotel room at the Doubletree in Nanuet, New York after she did not respond A source tells DailyMail.com that Rosie was recently given full custody of the couple's two-year-old daughter Dakota  Rosie is still allowing Rounds to see Dakota says the source, and has been to the hospital to see Rounds following her reported suicide attempt ' O'Donnell was photographed last week on a romantic getaway in Florida with her new girlfriend, actress Tatum O'Neal     
The estranged wife of Rosie O'Donnell was hospitalized in New York Tuesday night after attempting suicide. 

DailyMail.com has confirmed that Michelle Rounds was rushed to the hospital Tuesday night after a concerned friend called police, who then kicked down the door to her hotel room.  She was released from the hospital Wednesday afternoon. 

Rounds had allegedly 'taken some pills and drank wine' according to an insider with knowledge of the situation. 

The incident comes just one week after DailyMail.com released exclusive photos of O'Donnell and her new girlfriend Tatum O'Neal enjoying a romantic getaway at her West Palm Beach mansion.  

A source also revealed to DailyMail.com that Rounds recently lost custody of the couple's daughter Dakota to O'Donnell.   

  
   
Rosie O'Donnell's ex Michelle Rounds was rushed to the hospital Tuesday night after a concerned friend called police (couple above in 2012) 
   
Back home: Michelle Rounds returned to her Nyack home today after hospital treatment for a suicide attempt 
   
Moving on: O'Donnell was photographed last week on a romantic getaway in Florida with her new girlfriend, actress Tatum O'Neal 
 
Custody: O'Donnell and Rounds  have been fighting over custody of their adopted daughter Dakota, 2, (above) since O'Donnell filed for divorce in February 

Radar  first reported on Wednesday that Rounds was taken to Nyack Hospital.   

O’Donnell was at the side of her estranged wife after her she was hospitalized following the suicide attempt. 

The television host then drove Rounds from the hospital to her home overlooking the Hudson River. The former couple pulled up their hoodies and fled inside the three story house through a garage upon their arrival. 

Three other women joined them, but left the pair alone soon after they had unloaded a suitcase and other personal items belonging to Rounds. 

One friend, asked by DailyMail.com, how Michelle was, said: ‘She’s doing pretty good.’  

O'Donnell is doing her best to help Rounds according to another source, and letting her see their child after she was awarded full custody. 

'She's bending over backwards and won't try to prevent Rounds from seeing Dakota,' says the source. 

They also said that Rounds behavior has been erratic lately and that she wants O'Donnell back and is jealous of her new relationship. 

'Basically, Michelle is deeply in love with Rosie and wants her back. She hopes it can still happen,' says the source. 

'It hasn’t been an easy time for Michelle with Rosie stepping out with her new girlfriend and losing custody of Dakota to her.' 

On Tuesday, O'Donnell retweeted a video that has recently gone viral of a young girl, 6, asking that everyone be friends - especially her divorced parents. 
   
Rosie also has four children she shares with first wife Kelli, including adopted daughter Chelsea, in black hoodie, who went live with her birth mother on her 18th birthday. This photo was taken six months ago 
 
Rounds, 43, and O'Donnell, 53, separated last November a little over two years after being married in June 2012, with the talk show host filing for divorce in February this year. 

The pair's whirlwind romance started in the summer of 2011, when Rosie approached the corporate headhunter in a Starbucks because she thought Rounds' puppy was cute. 

They were engaged in December 2011 and married in June 2012 in a private ceremony after Rounds tried to get pregnant and Rosie suffered a heart attack. In January 2013 they announced they had adopted a baby girl following Rounds' battle with desmoid tumors.  

The two have been fighting in court ever since their separation last year, with the primary issue being the custody of their adopted daughter Dakota. 

Rounds had requested sole custody initially claiming she was a more attentive parent, and TMZ reported in May that she said O'Donnell should be subject to drug tests because of her excessive drinking and marijuana usage. 

She has also maintained she is not looking to profit from her divorce, telling Entertainment Tonight; 'I made my first million before the age of 39, that was before I met Rosie. I don't need Rosie's money. 

'I don't want Rosie's money. Nothing was in my name. The prenup money means nothing to me.' 

O'Donnell also has four older children. Her second eldest, adopted daughter Chelsea, recently moved to live with her biological mother on her 18th birthday after briefly running away from O'Donnell's home to be with a convicted felon when still 17 just last month. 

O'Donnell's relationship with O'Neal meanwhile - which began this summer - has heated up recently, with the two taking off on vacation last week. 

Photos showed them laying by the pool and boating while spending time at O'Donnell's newly purchased $4.975million mansion, which she scooped up in July. 

O'Donnell and O'Neal, 51, were both in need of downtime as they were recovering from health scares. O'Donnell had a minor heart procedure in New York at the beginning of the month, while Tatum was under the knife for a second operation on her knee in Los Angeles.

Scene: Police kicked down the door to Rounds' hotel room at the Doubletree in Nanuet, New York (above) 

O'Neal, who has three grown children from her marriage to tennis great John McEnroe, announced she was 'dating mostly women' in an interview with People  in May, saying; 'Women are the most amazing creatures on earth. 

'They're gentle and also more intelligent than the men that I've met recently.'  

She then expanded on her new-found sexuality in a piece she wrote in the September issue of Harper's Bazaar . She said she hadn't dated a man in two and a half years. 'In the physical sense, I'm not attracted to men right now at all,' she wrote. 

O'Neal, who won an Oscar aged just 10 for her role in Paper Moon, has fought a life-long battle with heroin. She said she had experimented with women in the past, but it is only now she is drug-free that she has gone further. 

'Now I'm clean and aware and alive and interested in the world, saying: ""Dating women is exciting to me, and this is turning me on."" 

'I dated in the heterosexual world up until about four years ago, when I started thinking about dating women — just thinking about it.' 
   
Getting close: O'Donnell's relationship with O'Neal  - which began this summer - has heated up recently (pair above last week) 

O'Neal said she was in her hair salon and saw a couple of pretty assistants. 'I said: ""I want to go on a date with her!"" 

'I finally decided to pursue it last year,' added O'Neal. 'I went to a Super Bowl party…and I saw this hot beautiful woman in her mid-30s serving drinks. She was kind of tough and sassy. I got her number and I think she called me, or I called her — I can't remember — and we went on a date.' 

She said they dated for a couple of months but her friend wanted to get more serious. 'But it was too soon for me,' wrote Tatum.  

A rep for O'Donnell did not respond to request for comment, and previously denied that her client was dating O'Neal.

2730,"The state of Britain's local roads is the number one gripe among drivers, according to a survey. 
 
One in 10 motorists said the condition of local roads was their top concern, while a further 20% listed it as one of their four main issues. 
 
The RAC said the figures show that councils should be under the same legal obligation to maintain roads as they are to provide minimum standards for education and social services. 
 
The Local Government Association (LGA) insisted that current funding levels mean councils cannot afford to carry out long-term improvements on roads. 
 
Half of the 1,500 motorists polled believe the quality of roads in their area has deteriorated in the past 12 months with just 10% claiming it has improved.  The remainder reported no change. 
 
The study was commissioned for the RAC's 2015  Report on Motoring. 
 
Among the 50% who believe the roads in their area are getting worse, the vast majority (99%) attribute this to potholes and general damage to the road surface. 
 
Litter is a source of annoyance for a quarter of people (24%), while poor maintenance of verges annoys one in five (21%). 
 
RAC chief engineer David Bizley urged councils to spend more of their funds on repairing and replacing road surfaces. 
 
""They are under specific legal obligation to provide minimum standards in education and social services whereas their obligations to maintain roads are far less prescriptive,"" he said. 
 
""It is therefore inevitable that expenditure is biased against investment in the likes of road maintenance where prescriptive legal obligations do not exist and councillors therefore do not face legal sanctions."" 
 
Mr Bizley warned there is a ""damaging disconnection"" between what a ""large proportion"" of council tax payers want local government to spend their money on and where it actually goes. 
   Promoted stories   
But councillor  Peter Box, transport spokesman for the LGA, said councils have to prioritise their expenditure. 
 
"" While councils share the frustration of motorists at the state of our roads, it is impossible to compare repairing potholes with keeping children safe and caring for our elderly,"" he said. 
 
""With demand on these life and death services continuing to rise and funding from central government continuing to reduce, councils have little choice but to squeeze budgets for other services, such as maintaining our roads."" 
 
He added:  ""Current funding levels mean councils are only able to keep pace with patching up our roads and filling potholes rather than carrying out more cost-effective and long-term improvements."" 
 
Michael Dugher, Labour's shadow transport secretary, said:  ""Ministers are just not listening to motorists' concerns. They promised they would fix our local roads and the pothole crisis, but it was just all talk. 
 
""Road users have understandably had enough of their failure and broken promises."" 
 
But the Department for Transport (DfT) insisted that it was ""playing our part"". 
   
 Share article  
   
A DfT spokesman said: ""A well maintained local road network is essential for all road users. 
 
""We are playing our part by providing nearly £6 billion to councils in England to maintain local roads over the next six years. This funding includes incentives so councils plan ahead and repair roads properly so potholes never form in the first place.""",aa35a92f-667b-4e1d-8c62-8574c3fb9c51,News,2015-09-08T01:24:44Z,Daily Gazette,Potholes and poor surfaces top gripe for drivers on local roads,0.0,Blog

4083,"Story highlights Swiss prosecutors open criminal proceedings against Sepp Blatter Blatter's lawyer says ""no mismanagement occurred"" FIFA says it is cooperating with investigation UEFA yet to comment on situation 
A statement released by the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) of Switzerland confirmed it was examining a contract signed by Blatter with the Caribbean Football Union and an alleged ""disloyal payment"" of $2 million to UEFA president Michel Platini. 

Former senior FIFA official Warner was indicted in the wide-ranging bribery scandal, while Platini entered the race to succeed Blatter as FIFA president in July. 

The statement was released after Blatter, who has been in charge of soccer's world governing body since 1998, was interrogated by OAG representatives Friday following a meeting of the FIFA Executive committee in Zurich. 

Blatter's lawyer Richard Cullen, said that ""no mismanagement occurred."" 

In a statement sent to CNN, Cullen said: ""We're confident that when the Swiss authorities have a chance to review the documents and the evidence they will see that the contract was properly prepared and negotiated by the appropriate staff members of FIFA."" 

The OAG confirmed that it had conducted a search at FIFA headquarters with the help of the police -- including Blatter's office -- and ""data seized."" 

""The OAG suspects that on 12 September 2005 Mr. Joseph Blatter has signed a contract with the Caribbean Football Union (with Jack Warner as the President at this time); this contract was unfavorable for FIFA,"" said the statement. 

""On the other hand, there is as suspicion that, in the implementation of this agreement, Joseph Blatter also violated his fiduciary duties and acted against the interest of FIFA and/or FIFA Marketing & TV AG. 

""Additionally, Mr. Joseph Blatter is suspected of a disloyal payment of two million Swiss Francs to Michel Platini, President of Union of European Football Association (UEFA), at the expense of FIFA, which was allegedly made for work performed between January 1999 and June 2002 ; this payment was executed in February 2011,"" added the statement. 

UEFA was not immediately available for comment after the OAG said that Platini had been ""heard as a person asked to provide information,"" while one of Warner's officials told CNN ""he wouldn't be saying anything."" 

Platini, who became president of Uefa -- the European governing body in 2007 -- is also a vice-president of FIFA. 

The 60-year-old became a member of FIFA's executive committee in 2002 as well as chairman of the technical development committee and worked on the 2006 World Cup organizing committee . 

In a statement, FIFA said it had been ""cooperating"" and has ""complied with all requests for documents, date and other information."" 

It added: ""We will continue this level of cooperation throughout the investigation. We will have no further comment on the matter as it is an active investigation."" 

The incident comes eight days after Secretary General Jerome Valcke was suspended by FIFA, while the organization investigates allegations he participated in a scheme to profit off the sale of World Cup tickets on the black market. 

Valcke has been relieved of his duties until further notice. 

FIFA was plunged into crisis in late May when seven officials were charged for racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering by the FBI. 

The charges are part of a U.S. prosecution that indicted a total of 14 people from around the globe. 

Meanwhile, a separate probe by Swiss authorities is investigating potential corruption into the bidding process for both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups , which will be hosted by Russia and Qatar. 

Qatar's controversial bid for the latter was backed by Platini, and the tournament has since been switched from the emirate's summer months to the winter following concerns over unsafe temperatures. 

Platini, South Korea billionaire Chung Mong-Joon, Jordan's Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein, ex-Brazil player Zico and Liberian FA chairman Musa Bility have all announced their intention to run for president. 

To stand in the February 2016 presidential election, candidates will need letters of support from at least five FIFA member nations. 
U.S investigation 
Meanwhile, a U.S. law enforcement official says the U.S. Justice Department is coordinating and sharing information with the OAG on the ongoing FIFA investigation. 

Blatter is among the senior FIFA officials who remain under investigation, U.S. law enforcement officials told CNN. 

The importance of the Swiss investigation against Blatter is that while the FBI has been focusing on his possible role in FIFA corruption, there are limits to U.S. jurisdiction. 

U.S. prosecutors have claimed jurisdiction based on the fact financial transactions that are part of the alleged bribery schemes used U.S. banks or occurred in the U.S. 

The U.S. investigators have had some trouble directly linking Blatter to those U.S. transactions, according to a U.S. official familiar with the investigation. Swiss investigators may have an easier time making those links, if they exist, since Blatter is based there.

What a difference a week makes, right? After suffering another crushing loss to Florida last Saturday, the Cats rebounded tonight, beating #25 ranked Missouri 21-13. 
 
There was a LOT riding on this game for Kentucky, and they delivered on almost every front, Patrick Towles silencing the haters, the defense holding up their part of the bargain, and the program getting a crucial win, its first over a ranked opponent in five years. 
 
Let’s break it down, because that was a lot of fun. 
 Patrick Towles redeemed himself  
Towles’ play was the story of the game. After a bad showing against Florida, many in the fan base were calling for Patrick’s curly-locked head. Towles swore off social media to escape the haters this week, and his focus today showed. Towles was 22-27 for 249 yards, two touchdowns and zero interceptions, and added another 21 yards on the ground for a touchdown. “Patty Feet” was back in a big way, with Towles scrambling like the QB of old. Jared Lorenzen called for Patrick to take back the reins and scramble when needed, and thankfully, he did tonight. 
 
After the week he’s had and the game he turned in tonight, can you blame him for celebrating like this? 
 

 
Stoops told reporters afterwards that he’s pretty stingy with game balls, but he had to give one to Patrick tonight. 
 
“I gave him a gameball. I thought he played a really good game and made some really good plays with his feet and was aggressive down the stretch,” Stoops said. He added he was careful not to pile on the criticism before the game. “I don’t like to get involved with that. I really didn’t say much. Just go do what he does every day. Give him support and give him a pat on the back.” 
 Five guys who were also crucial   Garrett Johnson : “Towles to Juice” is becoming a familiar refrain in Commonwealth Stadium, and Johnson led the team in receiving tonight with 6 catches for 119 yards. He and Patrick are developing some major chemistry, and I feel most confident when the ball goes in his direction.  Ryan Flannigan : The senior linebacker finally returned to the field tonight after recovering from a nagging shoulder injury, and his presence made a difference. Flannigan had 8 tackles tonight, and kept the pressure on Maty Mauk and his receiving corps. It’s really nice to have him back.  CJ Conrad: Conrad got his first touchdown as a Wildcat tonight, finally making the highlight reel for something other than blocking. He finished with three catches for 55 yards and the aforementioned touchdown. Stoops knew it was only a matter of time until the true freshman made his mark.   
“I told Shannon to finally throw him the ball,” Stoops joked. “It was nice to see him get some catches. We knew it would happen.” 
  Dorian Baker:  After two huge drops in first quarters this season, admit it, you were a little worried when the ball headed in Baker’s direction. He didn’t help himself early on with an unfortunate unsportsmanlike penalty, but rebounded quickly to finish with 5 receptions for 51 yards and a touchdown. This catch should be in the SportsCenter Top 10:   

  JoJo Kemp:  Kemp has become the forgotten running back in UK’s rotation, but he looked like the JoJo from the South Carolina series tonight, leading Kentucky’s rushing attack with 13 carries for 66 yards. In typical JoJo fashion, he came through in clutch moments, giving Kentucky renewed life when drives were becoming stale.   
“I think he really had some critical runs,” Stoops told Tom Leach. “You never know who will have the big game, and our backs understand that.” 
  Honorable mention: I could go on and on, but for brevity’s sake, game balls also go out to Cory Johnson, Chris Westry, Jason Hatcher, and AJ Stamps. As Stoops emphasized in his postgame remarks, this was a team win in every form and fashion.   UK finally got a third quarter touchdown  
The third quarter has not been Kentucky’s friend this season, and I was pretty worried when the Cats seemed to implode after halftime. Patrick Towles, who looked so confident to start the game, was reverting to bad habits, and the rest of the team wasn’t doing much to help him out. Thankfully, CJ Conrad came along and broke the dry spell, hauling in his first touchdown reception as a Wildcat. That was enough to earn him a shoutout from legendary UK tight end Jacob Tamme: 
 
I see you @cjconrad1  #BBN

 The pass interference call on Blake McClain was terrible  
Again, it’s a win, so I don’t want to harp on negative things, but the pass interference call on Blake McClain at the start of the fourth quarter was really frustrating. The officials claimed McClain grabbed the other guy’s jersey, which wiped out a 70-yard interception return for a touchdown by AJ Stamps. Thankfully, the defense stood tall and recovered, but that could have been a call that would come to haunt the Cats. 
 Stoops apparently danced in the locker room  
Garrett Johnson told reporters that Stoops joined in the postgame locker room revelry, breaking out some dance moves that hopefully were recorded by a player with a quick iPhone trigger. Stoops laughed it off in his interview with Tom Leach, claiming that he was only trying to get the guys rounded up to talk about the win and got lost in the moment, but can you imagine? I’ve seen a LOT of awkward dancing to “Grove Street Party” in the past two weeks, but Stoops dancing would probably take the cake. Stoops paused several times during his remarks, telling reporters and Tom Leach the win felt like a blur. Apparently defensive coordinator DJ Eliot was so happy he walked around the Wildcat Den randomly hugging media members. As he kept repeating, this was a “huge win.” 
 The path to a bowl looks MUCH more manageable now  
A week ago, the world looked pretty bleak, didn’t it? The loss to Florida bruised the hopes of a fragile fan base that was finally believing, but, thankfully, the team’s resolve remained strong. Patrick Towles silenced the haters and showed he’s still the guy to lead this team. Most importantly, the path to the postseason looks promising, with the Cats halfway to bowl eligibility. All they need to do is beat EKU, Charlotte, and Vanderbilt. Four games in, would you have imagined a more manageable path? If the Cats can’t handle that, they don’t deserve to go to a bowl. 
 
“Much like a week ago, we were put in a situation where you needed to make some plays,” Stoops said. “It was nice to do it tonight. We were on the wrong end a week ago, but we have been in a bunch of close football games this year and came out with three victories – so, proud of that.” 
 
After falling on their face against Florida, the Cats took care of business and took a major step forward tonight, beating a ranked opponent and moving one step closer to a bowl. Not only that, they overcame some mistakes and won. How often have we been able to say that? For that reason alone, we should all feel like this right now:",1911297c-3fb3-459b-9d5b-13faff0f4752,Blog,2015-09-27T04:24:50Z,Kentucky Sports Radio,Patrick Towles bounces back with a huge win over Missouri,1.0,News

2505,"For three Tampa attorneys gone rogue, it's about to end as badly as possible. But maybe it didn't have to. 
     
The judge overseeing the infamous disciplinary case against attorneys Stephen Diaco, Robert Adams and Adam Filthaut is recommending what amounts to a career death sentence: All three should be disbarred for good for plotting and pulling off the DUI arrest of opposing counsel one night after court. 
 
I say one night, though according to testimony, weeks earlier one of them tried to get attorney C. Philip Campbell similarly arrested with the help of a friend who was a sergeant on the police DUI squad. There was a stakeout, though Campbell wasn't stopped that night. 
 
But you know what they say: If at first you don't succeed, try, try again — next time, with the help of a comely undercover paralegal cozying up to your mark at a dark downtown bar. 
 
Now a state Supreme Court that does not look kindly upon lawyerly high jinks that embarrass the profession will decide punishment for the three. 
 
So how about a what if. 
 
What if, instead of insisting they were upstanding citizens acting nobly to get a drunk off the streets that night, these three stepped up and admitted what they did? 
 
What if, once accused and confronted with damning evidence, they stopped behaving like high-powered hot dog lawyers who never met a line they wouldn't cross? 
 
What if they said they got caught up in a bitter, high-profile, high-stakes court battle and made a terrible, grievous mistake? 
 
In a different but also notable story involving attorneys, the Times ' Susan Taylor Martin reported this week that the Bar is hiring a public relations firm to the tune of $96,000. Critics fear most of that money will got to putting a positive spin on controversial ""reciprocity."" In lawyer-speak, that's letting out-of-state lawyers ply their trade here without taking the Bar exam. Plenty of Florida lawyers do not like this idea, since our state is already thick with lawyers and law schools churning out more. 
 
Imagine the Bar instead spending that kind of money on, say, free legal services to people in need. That could help offset the damage done to their image by lawyers gone wild. 
 
So back to what did and did not happen in the Diaco deal. The Florida Bar, which acts as prosecutor, often settles disciplinary cases short of trial, particularly when there is contrition. This happens sometimes in cases involving lawyers with substance abuse issues, though rarely when client money has been stolen. The Bar appears to have zero sense of humor on that subject. 
 
In fact, the Bar had been ready to agree to plea deals in this case — Diaco disbarred for at least five years and 91 days for the other two. But nowhere in those deals did the lawyers accept responsibility for what they were accused of. The judge rightly rejected them. 
 
Yes, an FBI investigation continues into the DUI set-up, and that's enough to give the lawyers for the lawyers pause about their clients coming clean. 
 
But all that ugly evidence against them would be laid bare either way — as the judge put it, evidence of ""a deliberate and malicious effort to place a heavy finger on the scale of justice.""

2628,"Story highlights Estonia, a neighbor of Russia, welcomes U.S. stealth fighters U.S. jets conducting training in Europe 
The Baltic nation of 1.3 million people shares a border with Russia, and tensions have escalated in the region since Russia's takeover of Crimea from Ukraine in early 2014 and subsequent fighting between Ukraine government forces and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. 

""Over the past year and a half we've seen the security situation in Europe change quite fundamentally,"" Estonian Defense Minister Sven Mikser said during Friday's visit of the F-22s, as reported in the military newspaper Stars and Stripes . ""The more aggressive and provocative behavior by our eastern neighbor Russia has made it necessary for ... the NATO alliance to readjust."" 

The Raptors, based at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, have been on temporary assignment at Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany as part of the European Reassurance Initiative, ""which provides support to bolster the security of our NATO allies and partners in Europe while demonstrating the U.S. commitment to regional and global security,"" according to an Air Force statement. 

""It is also a huge recognition of the Estonian state, the Estonian Air Force and, more specifically, of the Amari (Air Base). We are ready to and capable of welcoming such aircraft,"" Mikser said, according to a report from Estonia's Postimees English news website. 

A-10 Thunderbolt II attack jets joined the F-22s in the Estonia flyover. The A-10s, nicknamed ""Warthogs,"" have also been conducting training missions in the Baltics. 

""This as a whole is the most important message in a situation where our eastern neighbor is still aggressive and is carrying out different unnecessarily aggressive and provocative activities,"" Mikser said, according to Postimees.",96b993b2-320f-457a-bab2-6bc214c05013,News,2015-09-07T18:09:09Z,CNN,U.S. stealth fighters visit Estonia,0.0,Blog
4802,"Traveling on a plane can come with a slew of seat-based comfort challenges, whether you’re assigned to a seat that doesn’t recline or located just adjacent to the bathroom. If you want to get the best seat without having to pay extra cash, there are a few simple tips to follow. While you might not feel like you’re lounging in a featherbed in one of the many luxury hotels in Milan, you will optimize your chances of having a travel experience that’s comfortable, pleasant and relaxed. 1. Don’t Pre-Select Seats Many flyers are tempted to pre-choose seats when they book their plane flights on Hipmunk. However, it’s best to actually let the airline assign you seats when you check in; particularly for full flights. Airlines cannot require you to pay for premium seats if they are the only spots available. If you wait until everyone else on the plane has chosen a seat, there’s a good chance that one of the premium seats will be assigned to you at no cost. 2. Volunteer to Sit in an Emergency Exit Flight attendants need to fill emergency exit rows with capable passengers who can assist in an emergency. If you feel physically fit, you can volunteer to move to an exit row if flight attendants are looking to fill the seats (or swap someone out who is not qualified). Sitting in an exit row affords you a lot of extra leg room. It’s also often is an emptier row, as airlines usually pre-charge an extra fee to sit there. 3. Fly During the Middle of the Week Statistics show that the smallest number of travelers fly on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. To ensure you have the most room on the plane–and the biggest selection of great seats–fly during the work week. 4. Take Seats Freed by Upgrades Once you board a plane, some may opt to pay extra for first class or business class seats. Ask if you can take the seats they left empty. Many of these seats will have been occupied by frequent flyers or business travelers, which means that you might earn yourself a premium seat with extra legroom, greater recline or other great features. No matter whether you’re crossing a few state lines or the Pacific Ocean, having a comfortable seat can ensure you have a restful and pleasant flight. By following a few simple tips, you can find yourself the best seat possible without forking over any extra dough.",f8ce2cfd-95f7-44ec-ae5b-330d24eb75c1,Blog,2015-09-02T16:17:07Z,Tailwind by Hipmunk,How to Get the Best Seat on the Plane,1.0,Blog
1700,"DEAR JOAN: I have seen many inquiries about squirrels in your column, but nothing that addresses our situation. 

Squirrels are making problems for us all around the gutters of our house. 

I first heard the noise about three weeks ago, but this has obviously been going on for some time. The noise sounded like something was dragging a huge piece of concrete across our roof. When I went out to check, I found a squirrel attacking one of our gutters, which are now badly scratched. 

Our son has gone on our roof and found the same problem all around the perimeter of our house. Can you explain this behavior? What can we do to keep our gutters from being damaged further? We appreciate your advice. 

Squirrels anywhere you don't want them can be problem. (Courtesy of Mike Gordon) 

Sandy Esposito 

Danville 

DEAR SANDY: Although squirrels will sometimes gnaw on gutters to because of their continuously growing teeth, I think in this case the squirrels have built a nest in the gutters. 

It can happen when the gutters get filled with debris, which makes them pretty attractive to squirrels. 

You'll want to check to see if you have any young squirrels still in the nest. If it's all clear, clean them out and try putting gutter guards over them, or cover them with a mesh. 

If the squirrels still have youngsters in the nest, wait until they are grown before doing anything disruptive.

Too many bunnies 

The Hayward Animal Shelter is inundated with bunnies, and volunteers and staff are hoping you can help. 

Rabbits always are a bit of a difficult placement because most people going to shelters are looking for dogs and cats. But the shelter recently took in 14 rabbits, all of which had been cruelly left in boxes alongside the road. 

A kind soul spotted the boxes and checked them out, finding more than a dozen rabbits that most certainly would have died if they hadn't been found. 

Two rescue groups -- House Rabbit Society and East Bay Rabbit Rescue -- stepped in to help, but they also are now at capacity. In an attempt to find these rabbits their forever homes, East Bay Rabbit Rescue is having an adoption event featuring mostly Hayward Animal Shelter bunnies. 

All the bunnies are friendly, volunteers report, and all will be spayed or neutered before the event, which is slated for noon to 3 p.m. Saturday at Petsmart, 6960 Amador Plaza Road, Dublin. 

The adoption fee is $70 and includes a care packet and cardboard carrier. 

If you're wondering how to care for a rabbit, volunteers will be on hand to answer your questions. Rabbits are different from cats or dogs, but they make good pets for the right person.

680,"For the first time, the Food and Drug Administration has ordered a major tobacco company to stop selling brands of cigarettes. 

The FDA on Tuesday ordered the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company to stop selling for brands: Camel Bold Crush, Vantage Tech 13 and the regular and menthol versions of Pall Mall Deep Set Recessed Filter cigarettes. 

The FDA has ordered other cigarettes off the market before, but those actions involved much smaller companies selling much less popular cigarettes. 

The agency says it took the action because R.J. Reynolds had failed to prove the brands were no more dangerous than brands that have been on the market longer. 

""These decisions were based on a rigorous, science-based review designed to protect the public from the harms caused by tobacco use,"" Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, said in a statement. ""The agency will continue to review product submissions and exercise it's legal authority and consumer protection duty to remove products from the market when they fail to meet the public health bar set forth under law.""

4471,"It’s time to give credit where credit is due. 
 
The Edmonton Oilers’ amateur scouting department — and that of the AHL’s Bakersfield Condors — deserves some praise for finding a handful of free-agent talents this summer to improve the organization’s overall depth at every position. 
 
It starts up front, with a trio of new forwards signed to AHL-only contracts in Braden Christoffer, Alexis Loiseau and Connor Rankin. Josh Winquist, who led the Oilers’ prospects in scoring (4-1-5) at this past weekend’s Young Stars tournament, also re-upped with the Condors this summer after an impressive debut last season. Christoffer (3-1-4) was the biggest revelation in Penticton, looking like a legitimate prospect as opposed to fodder for the ECHL’s Norfolk Admirals, while Loiseau (2-2-4) and Rankin (2-0-2) also had their shining moments. 
 
Braden Christoffer may have been the Oilers best player here with 3-2-5. Comes out of nowhere. Well, Sherwood Park and REG Pats, actually 
 
— Mark Spector (@SportsnetSpec) September 14, 2015 
 

 
In goal, Eetu Laurikainen, a 22-year-old from Finland who previously played major junior in Canada with the WHL’s Swift Current Broncos, was another standout (at times) during the four-team showcase that also featured rookies representing the host Vancouver Canucks, Calgary Flames and Winnipeg Jets. 
 
Every team earned at least one win, but Edmonton won the tournament with a 2-0-1-0 record thanks in large part to those unheralded prospects. The Oilers were also the only team with a positive goals for-against ratio (18-10). Connor McDavid (1-1-2) played just one game and wasn’t a huge factor in an 8-2 blowout victory. Leon Draisaitl (2-3-5) was the more dominant force, while Darnell Nurse (1-0-1) scored a power-play goal and led the way physically.

On defence, the intriguing name was Loik Leveille, an undrafted tryout from the QMJHL who turns 19 next Friday but is already built like an NCAA linebacker. He had a mixed-bag showing, but could still earn an entry-level contract from the Oilers depending how he fares at training camp back in Edmonton this weekend. 
 Give these guys the credit  
Three men, in particular, should be commended for these signings to date. The first is Condors GM Bill Scott — the lucky man who helped land Connor McDavid at the NHL draft lottery — for getting those prospects to put pen to paper on AHL-only deals. The second is Oilers director of player personnel Bob Green, who was promoted to that position in January and effectively replaced the since fired Stu MacGregor, formerly Edmonton’s director of amateur scouting. Green is a great talent hawk, specializing in Western Canada and the WHL where he cut his teeth with the Edmonton Oil Kings and Medicine Hat Tigers. Green and the third man, amateur scout Jim Crosson, who was among those retained in Edmonton’s staffing overhaul, have their fingers on the pulse of the WHL and certainly had a hand in the additions of Winquist, Christoffer and Rankin. 
 
That trio may never develop into NHL impact players or even full-time big-leaguers — Condors coach Gerry Fleming compared Christoffer to retired role-player Bob Bassen — but they will be pushing Edmonton’s drafted prospects every step of the way and forcing them to step up in order to earn their keep. That’s called healthy competition, something the Oilers have been lacking at every level in recent years. It bodes well for the future, especially in terms of helping the higher-profile prospects reach their potential. If they don’t, this next wave will be nipping at their heels and capable of overtaking them going forward.

The Oilers may get a bad rap for their drafting record — which is full of well-documented failures from the last decade — but they do seem to be making strides in identifying late-bloomers and developing them into possible steals. Edmonton’s brass may not be discovering these diamonds in the rough when they are draft-eligible, but if the Oilers can manage to land them when they are ready to turn pro, that still makes for a happy ending. Perhaps subscribing to the better-late-than-never theory, Edmonton’s persistence appears to be paying off as evidenced by this latest haul. 
 
Granted, a guy like Christoffer had more to prove at the Young Stars tournament than a guy like Vancouver’s Hunter Shinkaruk, but when your free-agent signings are outperforming the opposition’s first-round picks, that’s an endorsement of your aptitude. A source of pride for Scott, Green and Crosson — they had to be all smiles from their lookout points at the South Okanagan Events Centre. 
 Getting personal with Crosson  
The latter is somebody I’ve got to know well since getting my start in this business a decade ago. In fact, Crosson is a reference on my resumé from his days as general manager of the AJHL’s Lloydminster Bobcats (2005-08) during my time as the team’s beat writer and local newspaper’s sports editor. We’d talk multiple times a week back then — off the record at length on some occasions — and even though the team didn’t achieve much success during his tenure there, I got an appreciation for Crosson’s scouting ability and knowledge of the game. I still run into him from time to time in the press box at Prospera Place — home of the reigning WHL champion Kelowna Rockets — but the Oilers keep Crosson and all of their scouts more tight-lipped, especially around draft time. What little tidbits I can glean from him always prove invaluable and his insights tend to be accurate. 
 
Edmonton #Oilers hire Jim Crosson as scout for AJHL, CIS, and WHL. He is a former prospect of the Oilers from 1980. 
 
— The Oilers Report (@OilersReport) September 9, 2010 
 

 
Crosson is very connected in the Edmonton-area hockey scene and he would have been familiar with Winquist, from St. Albert, and Christoffer, from Sherwood Park, since before their bantam draft year. Crosson likely built relationships with their fathers and families over the course of their junior careers as well. That they are both essentially local products and probably grew up idolizing the Oilers makes for an easy sell, but establishing and maintaining those connections goes a long way in securing commitments too. So give props to Crosson, whose opinions are obviously trusted by Green and all the way up the line to new Oilers GM Peter Chiarelli.

I was happy to see Crosson keep his job amidst that turnover, even if my redrafting of the Oilers came across as an indictment of his work and that of his associates, some of them now former associates. Reality is, they are employed in a results-driven, cutthroat environment that relies on accountability. 
 
Things are finally trending in the right direction for Edmonton — knock on wood — and the right people appear to be in place. That includes Scott, Green and Crosson, who together have a knack for finding prospects who can play at the next level — free assets that are flying under the radar on other teams. One of them will eventually boom and Edmonton’s scouts will go from goofs to geniuses. That’s just how the hockey world works.

The New Apple TV 4 Specs: 2GB RAM, WiFi 802.11ac, No Optical AudioBy Oliver Haslam | September 11th, 2015 AdvertisementsApple’s new fourth-generation Apple TV is so much more than the media streaming device that it replaces, and that’s mainly down to the inclusion of a full-blown App Store, allowing developers to bring apps and gaming to the big screen. Apple demoed things like shopping apps during the device’s big unveiling, but it’s clear that the main target here is gaming. Lots and lots of gaming. If there’s one thing that game developers like to know, it’s what hardware they are dealing with. Unfortunately, Apple isn’t known for sharing just what internals its devices carry, and the new Apple TV’s specifications page on apple.com is suitably sparse, but all is not lost! In a break from the norm, Apple has detailed additional information about what is inside the fourth-generation Apple TV or, at least, it has to developers. As is always the case, though, it didn’t take long for those developers to tell the world. Thank you, devs! While we already had some inklings as to what was beating at the heart of the Apple TV 4, the complete list of specifications makes for an interesting reading. On top of the Apple A8 64-bit CPU that we already knew about, it appears that Apple’s new set-top box also ships with 2GB of RAM. That’s more than the iPhone 6, for example, and should see the Apple TV perform particularly well when it comes to handling cache from video streams. Did we mention gaming? Games like RAM! Another interesting tidbit is the fact that the Apple TV still does not ship with a gigabit Ethernet port, but it has 802.11ac WiFi, meaning the new 802.11a/b/g/n/ac WiFi will be quicker than plugging a cable into the back of the thing. Apple has also removed the optical audio output from the back of the new Apple TV, meaning the only way to get sound out of the device is via HDMI – a real shame to those with more interesting home audio setups. There are HDMI doohickeys that can get around this particular problem, but when an upgrade removes a port you’re already using, that never leaves a good taste in the mouth! That said, people complained when the floppy disk and then SuperDrive was removed from Macs, too. Following is a shot of the specifications on the official Apple TV page: And here are the specifications from developer documents, revealing RAM which isn’t mentioned publicly on the main Apple TV page on Apple’s website: 64-bit A8 processor 32GB or 64GB of storage 2GB of RAM 10/100Mbps Ethernet WiFi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac 1080p resolution HDMI New Siri Remote / Apple TV Remote Thoughts?

1021,"Novak Djokovic said he had come ready for Roger Federer's attacking game and his fervent home support after beating the Swiss to secure the US Open - his 10th grand slam title.

Federer had swept aside six opponents without dropping a set en route to the final at Flushing Meadows, but his bid for an 18th major title was undone by Djokovic, who won 6-4 5-7 6-4 6-4.

It means the world number one has another US Open success to add to his first in 2011 and he moves just one short of Bjorn Borg in the Open era all-time list.

The 28-year-old has enjoyed a superb season, winning three out of four grand slam finals, and he now sits seven short of Federer's record 17 major triumphs.

Federer stuck to his attacking guns in Arthur Ashe Stadium, hitting the net, releasing his rush-return and deploying as much variety whenever he possibly could.

But the Swiss was inefficient - converting just four of 23 break points - and eventually seemed helpless in the face of Djokovic's masterful defence.

""That's who Roger is - that's why he has won so many grand slam titles,"" Djokovic said.

""I knew that coming to the court. I knew he's going to be aggressive. He's going to try to disrupt my rhythm, and he's going to put a lot of variety in his game.

""But I was ready for it. I was ready for the battle. That's what it was - three hours, 20 minutes.

""We pushed each other to the limit, as we always do. It's an ultimate challenge that I have now, winning against Roger back to back finals in Wimbledon and here, US Open.

""It's tremendous. I'm really, really proud of it.""

Federer was not the only obstacle Djokovic had to overcome, as the champion withstood immense support for his opponent throughout the match.

At times passion spilled over into hostility, as some spectators jeered Djokovic's shots and faults, which understandably agitated the Serbian, who ripped a button on his shirt after a particularly vociferous celebration.

""Obviously over the course of three hours 20 minutes match, you do have some ups and downs in concentration - you do sometimes let certain things distract you,"" Djokovic said.

""But it's important to get back on the course and go back to basics and remember why you are there and what you need to do.""

Djokovic added: ""I accept the fact. Everybody has a choice to support a player that they want to support.

""He absolutely deserves to have the support he does because of all the years and success that he had and the way he carries himself on and off the court.

""No question about it. Me, I'm there to earn the support, and hopefully in the future I can be in that position.""

Federer only won two fewer points than Djokovic over the course of the match but committed 17 more unforced errors and was made to rue his 19 missed break points.

""I had too many break chances. Of course some of them I could have done better, should have done better, you know, all these things,"" Federer said.

""There were a lot of opportunities missed. If it's backhand, forehand, volleys, it doesn't really matter at the end of the day.

""I know why I lost the match, very clearly - the moment I sat down at 5-2 down in the fourth or after the match was over.

""It's something I will work on, and keep moving forward. It's no problem for me.""

David Beckham led a pack of celebrities in the stands, with Robert De Niro, Sean Connery and Robert Redford all in attendance, but rain delayed the start of the match by three hours and it was not until 7.10pm the players finally emerged.

Djokovic had invited Scottish actor Gerard Butler into his box for the contest and the pair enjoyed an unusual exchange at the end of the match.

""We've known each other for several years and we are good friends,"" Djokovic said.

""Funny enough, I actually sent him a photo and a message (on Saturday) night. I was watching the 300 movie so when I went to my box, I looked at him and I said, 'This is Sparta!'

""It felt great. That's one of the most inspiring movies I watched.""

3128,"A man who dumped food waste in a farmer's field in Barton has been fined. 

Akam Hamad Abdullah, 23, of Highfields Road, Ipswich, pleaded guilty at Cambridge Magistrate's Court for failing in his duty of care to ensure that his waste was disposed of correctly under Section 34 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. 

A large amount of cardboard packaging and bin liners containing food waste was traced back to Abdullah who owns a food outlet specialising in English and European food and drinks in Foxhall Road, Ipswich. 

South Cambridgeshire District Council investigators interviewed Abdullah where he admitted that the waste discovered had originated from his business in Ipswich. However, he could not give a reasonable excuse as to how it was discovered in Barton. 
  
He was fined £450, £440 in costs, a victim surcharge and court fees totalling £1,085. 

South Cambridgeshire District Council is reiterating the need for residents to make sure that they use authorised waste carriers, registered with the Environment Agency, to dispose of rubbish. 

If you see someone in the act of fly tipping please contact the Police on 999. To report waste that has been fly tipped in South Cambridgeshire visit www.scambs.gov.uk and click on the 'Report It' button. 

Cllr Mick Martin, South Cambridgeshire District Council's cabinet member for environmental services, said: ""Whether you have dumped rubbish yourself, or waste has been taken from your home or business, there is simply no excuse for junk being fly-tipped in the countryside. 

""Clearing up fly-tipped rubbish costs us thousands of pounds each year and this is money we would rather be putting to a far better use providing positive services for local people. I hope this prosecution shows everyone that it doesn't matter if waste is dumped miles from your home, we will still make every effort to find the culprit.""",d7924f87-729f-4b4d-9c43-bdd3add2288a,News,2015-09-07T09:29:00Z,Cambridge News,Cambridge News commented Food business owner fined for fly tipping in Barton field,0.0,News

 GRANDE PRAIRIE, AB / TheNewswire / September 3, 2015 - ANGKOR GOLD CORP. (TSXV: ANK) (“ANGKOR” ) announced today the retirement of Dr. Adrian Mann, VP of Exploration effective August 31, 2015. Dr. Mann joined the Company in 2009 as a consultant overseeing Angkor Gold’s Cambodian properties and assumed the role of Vice President of Exploration in 2011. He has been a key contributor in helping guide Angkor towards a royalty derived revenue stream through the development of Angkor’s huge land package. 
  

The Company would like to thank Dr. Mann for his exceptional contribution to its success and wishes him well in the future. 
  

“Adrian’s vision and leadership was instrumental in delivering significant value to Angkor Gold’s shareholders for many years.  In particular, his experience and judgment was crucial in the identification and eventual sale of the Phum Syarung project, which is now in the final stages of development and soon to secure its extraction license from the Cambodian authorities,” said John-Paul Dau, ANGKOR’s VP of Operations.   
  

“Adrian’s dedication to the country and company are pillars on which ANGKOR has built its suite of world-class assets which include CW and Halo.  And he has put in place an exceptional exploration team to lead the business forward,” said Dau. 
  

Dr. Mann will remain available to the Company on a consulting basis as required while the Company continues to advance its flagship properties.  A decision regarding the appointment of a new VP of Exploration will be made at an appropriate time in the near future. 
  

CEO Mike Weeks commented, “Adrian improved the geological skillset of every person on the team; we all learned a great deal from him and he will remain our own pillar of wisdom, our ‘Obie Wan’, well past retirement.”   
  

Delayne Weeks, VP Social Development added, “Adrian exemplified everything about ANGKOR – how to accomplish far more with far less.  I am really proud to call him my colleague and wish him a wonderful retirement.  It has been a privilege and an honor to work with Adrian.”  
  
 ANGKOR ’s seven exploration licenses in the Kingdom of Cambodia cover 1,448 km 2 , which the company has been actively exploring over the past 6 years. The company has now covered all tenements with stream sediment geochemical sampling; the company has flown low level aeromagnetic surveys over most of the ground; drilled 21,855 meters of NQ core in 190 holes; and has collected in excess of 110,000 termite mound, and ‘B’ and ‘C’ zone soil samples in over 20 centres of interest over a combined area of over 140km2, in addition to numerous trenches and detailed geological field mapping. Exploration on all tenements is ongoing.  
  
 ANGKOR GOLD CORP. , a public company listed on the TSX-Venture Exchange, is Cambodia’s sole North American public gold explorer with a large land package and first-mover advantage. ANGKOR has longstanding relationships with all levels of Government (local to national).

1948,"Much of the world is still held captive by last century's dirty-energy system that has a long history of locking inequality into place, economically and politically.      
As the nations of the world tackle the problem of inequality, remember this: clean energy is part of the solution. 

Much of the world is still held captive by last century's dirty-energy system that has a long history of locking inequality into place, economically and politically. Look across the world and you will find the vast majority of people subject to the whims of a very few. And they are forced to pay exorbitant prices just to keep their lights on and water flowing. Here in the United States, this dirty, old-energy system has protected the profits of special interests while continuing to pollute our water and air -- essentially making the rest of us carry the health costs. This hits the poorest the hardest, whose asthma rates are skyrocketing and who have to choose between their health and putting food on the table. And this system has propped up despots and oligarchs, creating some of the least egalitarian, least democratic nations in the world. 

But what if everyone had the freedom to create and control their own energy? Imagine a world where we were not dependent on ever-more costly fuels controlled by the ever-shrinking few? Imagine a world where the ""fuel"" was limitless, free and healthy. 

This is not a pipe dream. It is happening in communities around this country and world, who are embracing energy democracy. In New York State, organizations like PUSH Buffalo are helping families reduce high energy bills through efficiency and solar energy, while creating new living-wage jobs for local residents. In Los Angeles, LAANE and the unions came together to triple the budget for energy efficiency and create a pipeline into good jobs targeted to those workers who have been on the bench the longest. 



Wind turbines in South Dakota. (image: NREL ) 

In Iowa and South Dakota, residents are harnessing the wind to produce more than a quarter of their electricity and creating economic opportunity for farmers in the process. In Arizona, Barry Goldwater, Jr. is fighting for rooftop solar because, as a standard bearer for the Republican Party, he believes every American has the right to capture and use energy from the sun. In South Carolina, Boeing employees make airplanes using clean renewable energy, strengthening pathways to the middle class through manufacturing. 

From neighborhoods to states, from the suburbs to the city, and from farms to factories, people are blazing a clean-energy path to economic growth and greater equality. Affordable clean energy for everyone is 100 percent possible and it is up to our leaders in government, business, and in communities around the world to make it so. 

When people are provided the opportunity to produce their own energy in a way that grows the economy and protects their health and the environment, every person has a chance at a better life. And since the fuels involved -- like the sun and the wind -- are free and can never run out, clean energy opens the door to generations of sustainable growth. This is exactly the kind of development the United Nations is trying to achieve through its new global Sustainable Development Goals. 

And as clean technology's costs continue to fall, a wonderful possibility emerges: developing countries can leapfrog fossil fuels entirely, skipping the dirty-energy sources of the past and going right to the cutting-edge clean and renewable-energy sources of the future. It happened with cell phones -- developing countries might not have much in the way of landline systems, but everyone has a mobile. If it happens with clean energy and localized ownership is prioritized, this world will be a very different place. 



Solar lamps provide new opportunities for families in India. (image: Swayam Shikshan Prayog/ USAID ) 

And just as mobile phones have been a force for democratization, so too will local renewable energy. Just imagine a world where the people own and control their own energy, instead of having to rely on a troubled regime or faraway company for power. 

More than a billion people still lack access to electricity. It's hard to envision ending poverty, hunger, and want -- or achieving any of the other Sustainable Development Goals -- if a billion people can't turn on a light when they need one, much less a computer. 

Clean renewable energy offers a way to bring people out of darkness, while developing local jobs and local economies -- and all this without doing damage to the planet or to the health of those who share it. It offers a way to unleash the human spirit -- the most powerful and equitably distributed energy of all.

1561,"CARTHAGE — For the second time this season, the Neosho Wildcats battled a state-ranked Central Ozark Conference Large opponent down to the final play. The Wildcats fell behind 14-0 to Class 5’s No. 9 Carthage late in the first quarter and trailed 20-6 at halftime Friday night at K.E. Baker Stadium. However, the Wildcat defense came through with consecutive drive-ending stops on fourth down and Devin Hames’ 4-yard touchdown run with 2 minutes, 10 seconds remaining in the game made it 20-19 Carthage. Neosho head coach Dustin Baldwin and the Wildcats decided to go for the two-point conversion and the lead, showing confidence in their offense and their defense. Jake Kleindl and Zach Thornton stopped a scrambling Coleman Scott short on the conversion after a play-action pass broke down and dodged a bullet on the ensuing onside kick, the ball trickling out of bounds before Neosho could gain possession. Neosho’s D stuffed Carthage’s Kendall Young on fourth-and-2 at the Neosho 42 and the Wildcats took over possession with only 7 ticks left. On first down, Scott missed Hames on a short pass. On second, Scott connected with Payton Klier over the middle. Klier gained 19 yards, tackled at the Carthage 39 as time expired for a 20-19 Carthage victory on its homecoming. Neosho’s two losses this season have come by a total of four points. Defensive stands fuel Wildcats In the second half, the Wildcats were very much a bend and don’t break defense. Taking first possession, the Tigers worked two first downs on third-down plays, a 9-yard pass and catch with quarterback Keith Guest and running back Young and a 33-yard pass from Guest to fellow junior Logan Kabance, a play that burned Neosho on three different occasions for nearly 100 yards and three first downs. Guest’s 12-yard run down to the Neosho 11 gave the Tigers a first down. After Carthage’s signal-caller ran for four yards on first down, Neosho stiffened, dropping Trey Collins for a two-yard loss and forcing an incomplete pass on second and third downs, respectively. With a fourth-and-8 at the Neosho 9, Carthage went for it and Guest’s pass to Tyler Ralston took the senior wide receiver out-of-bounds. On the subsequent Neosho possession, the Wildcats moved the ball near Carthage territory behind a pair of first-down runs by Hames and Scott, Scott’s 11-yard run a highlight of the drive. The Tigers were whistled for a 15-yard personal foul penalty, giving Neosho first-and-10 at the Carthage 37. The Wildcats dialed up a little trickeration, as backup quarterback Gavin Kelley hit Ethan Siler for a 37-yard TD pass on a halfback pass. Brett Williams’ extra point made it 20-13 Carthage with 2:30 left in the third. Page 2 of 4 - We had a brand new game. Dillon Lancaster’s 21-yard kickoff return gave Carthage possession at its own 30 with 2:21 remaining in the third. Once again, Carthage pieced together a drive into Neosho territory and the Tigers had an apparent first down on fourth-and-1 at the Neosho 21 taken away by a holding penalty. With a fourth-and-13 at the Neosho 33, Guest overshot Ralston down the middle and the Tigers had their second 10-plus play drive stall out with no points. Taking over at their own 33 with 9:04 left on the clock, the Wildcats answered with their own meticulous drive lasting 6:54 and taking 17 plays before Hames’ 4-yard TD run. Hames leaped into the end zone from about the Carthage 2. Key plays on the drive included a Jarvis Funk 10-yard reception that gained 10 yards back after an illegal block. Then, on the next play, rather than a fourth-and-long, Neosho faced a fourth-and-1 and Scott earned it with a 2-yard keeper. Klier made a 13-yard catch, followed by a Hames 10-yard run and the Wildcats earned first-and-goal after Scott rushed for six yards on a fourth-and-2. Turnovers, not penalties Two Neosho turnovers proved costly in the first half. On the first play of the game, Neosho worked a shuffle pass to Klier for a 33-yard gain down to the Carthage 32. Six plays later, with a second-and-5 at the Carthage 10 after a Funk 10-yard reception and a Hames 5-yard run, Klier fumbled the ball and Carthage recovered it at the 12. Four first downs and one Kabance 37-yard reception down to the Neosho 1 later, Carthage scored the first TD on a Collins 1-yard run. Down 20-6 late in the first half, Collins intercepted Scott in the flat on the Wildcats’ first play after Carthage took its 14-point lead on a Collins 10-yard scamper. That was Scott’s first interception since three in the season opener against McDonald County. Fortunately, for the Wildcats, their defense came through with a stand, gang-tackling Guest short of a first down on fourth-and-5 at the Neosho 25. After surrendering 20 points on three of Carthage’s first four possessions, the Wildcat defense answered the bell the rest of the game and Carthage’s last four possessions all ended in Neosho fourth-down stops. On the bright side, Neosho avoided the penalties that had plagued the Wildcats the previous four weeks. There were no touchdowns called back on penalties or opponents’ drives extended due to a needless personal foul. Wildcat offense in shuffle mode Neosho’s first touchdown came on a Klier 66-yard gain off a third-and-3 shuffle pass only 11 seconds into the second quarter and the Wildcats had 99 yards and one TD off those two plays. Page 3 of 4 - All other plays in the first half resulted in a net of 15 yards, the Wildcats hurt by three quarterback sacks on Scott totaling in losses of 25 yards. Neosho picked it up in a second half during which both teams each had three possessions, scoring on its first two after going 1 for 6 in the first half. Up next Neosho, 3-2 overall and 1-2 in the COC Large, hosts the Nixa Eagles on Friday for homecoming. The Wildcats’ juggernaut schedule continues with state-ranked Nixa after state-ranked Carthage and before state-ranked Webb City, the five-time defending Class 4 state champions ranked in the top 20 high school football teams in the United States by USA Today. The Cardinals are currently ranked No. 17. Webb City defeated Nixa 31-16 on Friday night. Cardinals running back Hunter Vanlue rushed for 102 yards and two touchdowns on seven carries, his 53-yard TD run giving Webb City a 14-0 lead in the first half. Keaton Burroughs’ 95-yard TD run opened the scoring, while Nixa’s Logan Tyler, a Florida State recruit at placekicker, scored on a 53-yard TD run for Nixa’s first score. Cory Duley kicked a 44-yard field goal for Webb City and backup quarterback Andrew Greek made it 24-6 halfway through the second quarter with a 9-yard run. Nixa’s backup quarterback Andrew Rivera hit Chase Allen on a 16-yard TD pass for a 24-13 halftime score. Burroughs finished with 165 yards on a night when the Cardinals played without their regular starting quarterback Tyson Roderique. Tyler briefly came out in the second quarter after landing awkwardly on a run. The Eagles and the Wildcats share at least two similarities entering their game next Friday: both teams own 3-2 overall records with both their losses coming against state-ranked opponents, Neosho to fellow Class 5 district opponents Willard and Carthage and Nixa to Class 6 Francis Howell and Class 4 Webb City. The Eagles defeated Willard two weeks ago to knock their rival Tigers out of the Class 5 rankings. Carthage, winners of four straight games after a 31-0 season-opening loss to Webb City, travel to Republic for their second meeting with a fellow Tigers squad in three weeks, coming off Ozark two weeks ago. Republic improved to 3-2 with a 42-20 win over winless Branson. The Pirates’ losing streak increases to 13 games.

The footage shows the fatal shooting of 41-year-old Gilbert Flores, 41, by Bexar County sheriff’s deputies Greg Vasquez and Robert Sanchez just before noon on Aug. 28 in San Antonio. 

The Bexar County Sheriff's Office said in an initial statement Flores was armed with a knife and resisting arrest when the officers responded to a domestic disturbance call. Neither deputy was wearing a body camera. 

However, cellphone video captured by a bystander appears to shows deputies approaching a shirtless Flores as he puts his hands up to surrender before he is shot multiple times and falls to the ground, motionless. One of Flores' arms is obscured by a light post. It is not possible to see if he had a weapon in the hand which is not visible in the video.

Yesterday we saw the photo of Arsene Wenger flying to Paris, and it could have meant one of two things.

One, he was going back to France to chill out while the international break played itself out while providing TV commentary during France's matches. Or it could have meant that, but also to pry away a few assets from the capital city's biggest club.

According to the London Evening Standard, Wenger flew in to Paris yesterday to initiate talks for striker Edinson Cavani and holding midfielder Adrien Rabiot. Apparently, according to this article, Wenger wants to give Francis Coquelin a chance to hold down that spot but recognizes the options behind Le Coq are Mathieu Flamini and a severely broken-down Mikel Arteta.

Research has shown that sitting too much is bad for you in a variety of ways. But it's a tough habit to break, and it's one we learned at a very young age. Even in preschool we were taught to sit at our desks, not stand at them. 
 
But it doesn't have to be the same for kids today. That's what Jaswig , an ergonomic furniture manufacturer, believes. The startup, which has offices in both Belgium and the U.S, has created the StandUp, a height-adjustable standing desk. Adults can use it too, but it was created with kids in mind. 
  Jaswig   
""The idea behind making a version for children is that if standing regularly has many benefits, we should allow children to stand up as well if they want,"" Jaswig co-founder Mathias Ellegiers told TODAY.com. 
 
 RELATED: Don't let sitting all day kill you — 5 easy ways to keep moving at your desk  
 
Jaswig launched a Kickstarter campaign for the desk last month. So far they've raked in more than $60,000 — surpassing their goal of $54,735. Not only is the desk attractive to parents looking to instill healthy habits in their kids, it's also appealing to families who share a workspace. 
 
""Parents particularly like the desk because it fits the whole family,"" said Ellegiers. ""Both mother and son can use the same desk."" It's also pretty simple to put together. 
  Courtesy of Jaswig    Courtesy of Jaswig   
""All the pieces are designed for easy (dis)assembly so each part can be taken out and replaced if it's damaged,"" said Ellegiers. There are nine pieces to the desk that are connected with screws and dowel nuts, which are shipped in the package. And you don't need any tools to put it together: The screws tighten with the aid of an included Allen wrench. ""There will also be online videos where one of us actually puts the desk together,"" he said. 
 
 RELATED: Study reveals that women who sit too much have increased risk of cancer  
 
Although the Kickstarter ends Sept. 17, the desk, which is made of sustainably sourced wood, is available for pre-order . You can get the small version for $255, the medium for $320 or the tall one for $400.

76,"Jason Ainsley says Spennymoor Town must be wary of a Clitheroe side “full of confidence” as they seek to keep pace at the top of Evo-Stik North. 
 
The Moors are sixth in the table, with two wins and two draws. 
 
Yet they face a Clitheroe side at the Brewery Field today one place and a point above them. 
 
Ainsley said: “Clitheroe are coming here full of confidence after their good start to the season. 
 
“They have already won away from home once this season at Droylsden, which is no mean feat. We have to make sure we win and not drop out of the promotion pack.” 
 
Spenny will be without Glen Taylor (toe), Danny Frost (foot) and Michael Hogganson (appendicitis). 
 
Priestley Keithley has joined on non-contract terms from Middlesbrough and, though frustrated by injuries in his forward ranks, Ainsley is delighted by the form of strikers Liam Henderson and Nathan Fisher. 
 
He added: “We have not had much continuity because of the injuries. 
 
“Frosty has only played 18 minutes of the first game and Glen injured his toe at home but their (Henderson and Fisher’s) workrate and commitment have been excellent and they will probably start against Clitheroe.”",48e76704-5ea9-4daf-a876-492d58a67a1f,News,2015-09-05T05:30:00Z,Newcastle Evening Chronicle,"Spennymoor Town must be wary of 'full of confidence' Clitheroe, says Jason Ainsley",0.0,Blog

3409,"NSW: A Syrian refugee has opened up about the fear that forced him to leave his home country. A Syrian refugee has opened up about the fear that forced him to leave his home country. Muhammad Hussain, who now lives in Griffith with fellow refugee Zahid Hussain, recounted the many horrors he saw in his home country.

“(It’s) very dangerous (in Syria), every morning, every afternoon, every night, killing,” Muhammad said. “You sleep and when you wake up you look at the road at all the killing.”

After leaving Syria, Muhammad’s house was torched by insurgents.

Muhammad said there were mass murders in towns where in excess of 300 people were put into a single grave.

He has not heard from his father in four years but holds onto hope that he is alive.

“The first time I go to Pakistan because my father tell me ‘you go because I’m scared (for your safety). You go to Pakistan, look around Pakistan and see if you can live (there)’ but after this I come (to Australia),” Muhammad said.

“I was born in Syria, my father lived there for 35, 40 years. For four years, I don't know where he is.”

Muhammad fled Syria to Pakistan in 2012 before he came to Australia in October the same year.

His wife, daughter, brother and sisters still reside in Pakistan. Muhammad’s daughter was just seven months old when he left his family.

He is able to contact his family on the phone but hasn't seen anyone since he has been in Australia.

He hopes one day he will be able to visit neighbouring countries of Pakistan and Syria to visit his family.

One of his biggest fears is his daughter rejecting him as her father after living apart for so long.

“I only stay home, go outside, go back, it’s no life,” Muhammad said. “Mentally, every night it’s tough. When I stay here, I think about my family.

“My daughter when I left (Syria) was seven months old, now she’s four. When I talk with her she does not talk with me. We talk very little, hi, how are you, that’s all.”

Along with his family, Muhammad left behind a house and a business. He said he is stuck in limbo – not being able to work or study – and struggles to support his family.

He wants to see the government provide more support for refugees.

450,"New Australia captain Steve Smith will look back on the 2013-14 Ashes series as the greatest example of Brad Haddin's positive impact on the Australian team. New Australia captain Steve Smith will look back on the 2013-14 Ashes series as the clearest and greatest example of Brad Haddin's positive impact on the Australian team. When Smith made his first-class debut in early 2008 for NSW their gloveman was Haddin. Later that year he succeeded Adam Gilchrist in the Test team, a role current coach Darren Lehmann said he handled deftly despite the lofty expectations.

Smith, 26, said the now-retired Haddin had been a ""great mentor"" for him at state level, and had been even better when he progressed to the national team where Haddin was entrenched as first-choice wicketkeeper.

""In the Australian set-up as well he was always took me under his wing and helped me develop as a player and as a person. I'm very thankful for that,"" Smith said in Manchester on Tuesday evening, after learning of Haddin's announcement.

Smith marvelled at Haddin for making 493 runs at an average of 61.63 to, with Mitch Johnson, spearhead Australia's successful bid to regain the Ashes at home in 2013-14.

""The [2013-14] home Ashes, where we won 5-0, he was a massive part of that. I think he scored [at least] 50 in the first innings in all five of those Test matches,"" he said.

""Batting at No.7, I think he really came out and played positively. I think there were a lot of [instances] where he got us back into the game, just from sheer [will] and taking the game on. He was magnificent at that, and I think a lot of keepers around the world can learn from the way he played.""

Smith also hailed Haddin as ""certainly one of the best team men I've ever been around ... always put the team first in every aspect"".

Coach Lehmann, who first played against Haddin almost 15 years ago when the wicketkeeper was just 22, said Haddin was not only a fantastic player but also ""a fantastic mentor for a lot of young players [and] a great mentor for me as coach"".

""He's a fantastic human being and he'll be welcome in our change rooms all the time, because he's an absolute superstar,"" said Lehmann, who was part of the selection panel that excluded Haddin for the second half of the just-completed Ashes series.

""He made some crucial runs for us in Ashes series, and in different series all round in all formats. For us, his keeping was exceptional, his batting was very good. It was a case of him being able to turn a game very quickly for you. That's what [Adam] Gilchrist did exceptionally well as well.""

Lehmann said Haddin would leave a vast and diverse legacy: ""The baggy green, the way he wore it with pride. The way he helped younger players. The way he helped drive the team as a whole. The way he helped coaches. The way he helped mould the team. The way we play today is an exceptional legacy for him. The way he thought about his family and helped his family through difficult times, and the way he helps other people's family and friends,"" he said.

363,"Japanese expat turns frustration with ordering from Amazon UK into a comicJamie Koide

Moving to a different country can be fun and exciting, but it can also be tough. Most expats go through a period of culture shock where they realize that some of the stereotypes they were led to believe about a certain country may not be true, and that the way things work in their new home may not always be an improvement on the way things were done back in their old one.We’ve presented some things Japan doesn’t get right from a Westerner’s point of view in the past, but this time we’d like to show you a comic drawn by a Japanese illustrator living overseas, detailing some of the not-so-pleasant points of living in the UK and how some in particular made her quit shopping at Amazon.Mariko Umeda, a designer and illustrator, quit her job at a Japanese video game company to move to England and attend the National Film and Television School. When she’s not busy with classwork, she draws and uploads her own comics about living abroad as a Japanese expat.

Ore no Yome - the cafe where maids pretend to be your spouse

You arrive home after a long day at the office to your beautiful wife, smiling as she greets you at the door.

721,"At his heaviest, Dawn Lerman’s dad was 450 lbs. He tried to lose weight all the time—every week, he engaged in a new diet, some more successful than others, but nothing stuck. 
 
“In every corner of our house, there was no wall space,” Lerman says. “[Each wall] was either lined from floor to ceiling with diet books or shirts that represented my dad’s different weights. There was a pile: 185, 195, 205, 215, 225.” 
 
Lerman, a nutrition expert, cooking teacher, and Upper West Side mom-of-two, reflects on her tumultuous childhood relationship with food and how it affected her relationship with her family in her recent memoir, aptly named My Fat Dad . In the book, she describes how her creative family—her mother and sister were actresses, and her father worked in advertising as a writer and creative director, responsible for iconic slogans such as “Leggo My Eggo” and “Fly the Friendly Skies”—was always obsessing over food, but never in a healthy way. Her dad would diet, then maybe eat an entire pizza, then switch diets, while her mom would prepare either processed foods or nothing at all. It was Lerman’s grandmother who showed Lerman that, when prepared correctly, food could be a source of joy rather than stress. 
 
Lerman’s grandmother, whom people called Beauty, cooked traditional Jewish meals and encouraged making food into art rather than temporary sustenance. She and Lerman would sit down for meals, and no matter what they’d cooked, it would be set out on a nice plate, perhaps served with tea, and the two would eat “like ladies.” 
 
“My grandmother really drilled it into my head that food is love, food is happiness, [and] everything has to have a smell,”   Lerman says. “If it smells, if it has an aroma—it’s going to transform your world.” 
 
Once Lerman’s family moved from Chicago when she was 9, and she left Beauty behind, it was harder to stay positive. But Beauty would send recipe cards to Lerman at her new home in New York City. 
 
“My grandmother’s recipe cards saved my life because it kept me from getting in trouble. Every week I had this purpose and this mission,” Lerman says. “I had to go home, I had my recipe cards, I had to cook them for my sister…and I knew I had to take care of myself because nobody else would.” 
 
Lerman combined teachings from all the cooks in her life, whether it be Beauty’s “throw it in” style or her baker Aunt Jeannie’s carefully-measured approach, to take care of her own family. Her memories of Jeannie’s healthy “swaps” (like switching butter with applesauce) helped inspire Lerman to start her nutrition awareness program, Magnificent Mommies , which offers workshops to create healthier lifestyles for young children and their adults. 
 
But despite food’s looming presence in her formative years, Lerman’s path to becoming a nutritionist wasn’t exactly direct. She went through several professions first, including acting, producing commercials, and working as a school drama therapist with kids who suffered from ADHD, depression, and low self-esteem. 
 
“While working at the school, I realized how important proper food choices were,” she says. “I worked with kids on the importance of food choices, made snacks with them, and helped parents to add nutrient-loaded food into their children’s diets and get rid of sugar preservatives and artificial additives.” However, it wasn’t until a couple of years later, when her dad was diagnosed with cancer, that Lerman went back to school to study nutrition. “I realized helping people heal through food choices was my true calling,” she says. 
 
This creative yet practical approach that Lerman brought to her students guides how she cooks for her own children, as well. On her daughter’s first day of preschool, Lerman noticed how many of her classmates were eating unhealthy snacks. She started a blog, “ Snacking Outside the Box ,” for sharing her healthy recipes and cooking tricks, and started to bring treats into her daughter’s classroom to show that healthy cooking could taste good. 
 
“My daughter went to a preschool on the border of Harlem where many of the kids had never seen edamame or an avocado,” she says. “We made guacamole and edamame hummus. By teaching them to cook, we turned thier yucks into yums.” 
 
After her blog gained traction, Lerman tried to sell it as a book idea. But the response she received was largely: “That’s not your story. We want to hear about your family.” So she began writing about growing up with her fat dad for the New York Times’   “Well” blog , and the posts formed the basis for the book. 
 
Lerman was a little hesitant to explore her relationship with her father. She sent him chapters after she’d finished writing them so he could look them over, and calls the process “nerve-wracking.” However, her father’s response after reading the book was: “You’ve come a long way baby,” a tagline he’d created for Virginia Slims. 
 
Lerman has found that her story resonates with many; she’s received letters from people all over the world who’ve had a grandmother like Beauty or who had a parent who wrestled with extreme dieting. 
 
“My story is everybody’s story, and it could be your story, so the most important thing is trying to create good food memories around your kids, and be aware of the message you send to your children,” Lerman says. “Instill a love for food: For buying food, making food, eating food, and valuing what it does for your body. What we put in our body is how we’re going to live our lives. You’ve got to treat your body well.”

Art and Automotive Worlds Combine During New York Art Auction Season

The 1971 24 Hours of Le Mans N.A.R.T. 365 GTB/4 Daytona VIN 12467

At its unveiling at the Paris Auto Salon in 1968, the striking Ferrari 365 GTB/4 was immediately hailed as a masterwork. However, through June of 1971, the beautiful Berlinetta had not yet proven itself as the dominant competition machine it would become. A prototype race version was built and promptly crashed at the 1969 24 Hours of Le Mans, and only a middle field finish came much later in 1971. Nonetheless, North American Racing Team patriarch Luigi Chinetti Sr. 

Accordingly, Daytona 12467 was modified from a standard road car for N.A.R.T. and entered in the 1971 24 Hours of Le Mans. This era is still considered the golden age of road racing, due to the colossal battle between Ferrari and Porsche, and their awe inspiring 5-liter World Sports car Championship machines. Out of the box, in the world's most grueling race, '12467' finished a stunning fifth position overall, behind only the much larger and more powerful WSC machines. It came in eight laps ahead of the GT cars that it would be classified against in the future. By the end of that summer, with the requisite 500 road cars completed for homologation, the first of three batches (eventually totaling 15) of official Ferrari factory-prepared Daytona Competiziones were at the 1972 24 Hours of Le Mans. The racing world watched as a flank of Daytonas took fifth through ninth place overall, once again behind only WSC machines, and swept the GT class podium. The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona represents the final front engine road-based racecar built under the gaze of Enzo Ferrari 

""The N.A.R.T. Daytona is an example of our vision to carefully curate and celebrate, when possible, automobiles with unique origins, or notable achievements in history,"" said Co-CEO and Founder, Leigh Keno

  VOLL v Villanova (5 SEP 15) - Highlights 


Box Score | Season Stats 

  DENVER - The University of Denver volleyball defeated Villanova 3-1 (20-25, 25-18, 25-18, 25-19) Saturday to win the 2015 Pioneer Classic. The Pioneers went 3-0 in the tournament held in Hamilton Gymnasium and are 5-1 on the season. 

""Well, we're happy as always to get a win,"" head coach Jesse Mahoney said. ""We're struggling to come out of the gate playing well, and we didn't do that in that first set, although I thought Villanova played really well. But we righted the ship and definitely were firing on all cylinders by the final set."" 

Pioneer Classic MVP Cassie Baird (Indianapolis, Ind.) capped off a stellar tournament, serving a career-high four aces in the match. 

""I thought I had a pretty good weekend,"" Baird said. ""I didn't expect this award at all to be honest, but I think overall the team was very good, tonight especially. We were on fire, and that is what was important."" 

All-Tournament team member Kayla Principato (Rockville Centre, N.Y.) led the Pioneers with a career-high 15 kills in their final match of the Pioneer Classic. Nola Basey (Lyons, Colo.) notched a season-high 11 kills and Ruth Okoye (Aurora, Colo.) added 10 kills to the Denver total. Blocker Sarah Schmid (Highlands Ranch, Colo.) led the team with five blocks and hit .500 in the match. 

Splitting the setting duties once again, Piyusha Boteju (Euless, Texas) dished out 26 assists, while Monique Domme (Colorado Springs, Colo.) recorded 19 in the match and was named to the All-Tournament team. Denver stepped up defensively, with four players earning 10 or more digs in the match. 

Villanova came out sharp against Denver, holding the Pioneers to a .077 hitting percentage. Principato and Schmid each recorded three kills and three blocks in the first set as the leaders for the Pioneers. The Wildcats' Claire Crutchfield hit .625 with six kills, making up the difference between the offenses; Villanova had 17 kills to Denver's 11. 

Denver battled back in the second set to win 25-18. The Wildcats earned the first three points, but a kill by Baird put the Pioneers up 15-14 in the set and sparked a 5-1 run by Denver. DU hit .577 in the second set, with four players earning at least three kills in the set and six fewer attacking errors than the first set. 

For the second straight set, Denver won 25-18. Principato and Baird led the Pioneers with four kills apiece in the set. Baird also tallied two service aces to help the Pioneers out to their lead. Piyusha Boteju earned nine assists in the set as the offense found its stride once again. 

In the final set, the Pioneers outlasted the Wildcats, capitalizing on seven attacking errors by Villanova. Basey and Principato each recorded four kills, while Baird notched two aces for the second straight set. DU closed out the set on a 6-0 run to win the fourth set 25-19. 

Overall, the Mahoney and Baird agree the tournament was a learning experience for the Pioneers, as the young squad is still getting used to playing together. In every match, Denver faced challenging opponents and had to fight for the victory. 

""I saw that we can be really good, and we can be really average,"" Mahoney said. ""The goods outweigh the average enough for us to get wins, but to do what we want to do this season, we're going to have to get better. I was proud of my team. We fought back, in every match we had to fight back. But we've got to get better to achieve the goals we want to achieve."" 

""I'm expecting great things from the team,"" Baird said. ""Once we all get used to everything, we're going to be a very good team."" 

The Pioneers will have one more challenge tomorrow as they take on Western Michigan at 2 p.m. MT in a match televised on Altitude 2.

315,"The job market in India is improving. About 90 per cent of companies are looking to hire, says Sambhav Rakyan, data services practice leader for Asia Pacific at Towers Watson, a global HR consulting firm. ( Watch Video ) 
Mr Sambhav Rakyan says its hiring survey showed that strong demand is being seen for graduates from top-tier business schools, research jobs in pharma, technical areas like social, mobile, analytics and cloud computing (SMAC) and SharePoint. 

The top sectors where the companies would be hiring are sales and engineering, he added. 

Entry-Level Salaries 

Recently the HR consulting firm also released a global survey on entry-level salary. The survey throws up some interesting insights for India. The starting salary for university graduates in India is among the lowest in the Asia Pacific region at a median average of Rs 25,000 per month, says Mr Rakyan The range can be wide from Rs 10,000 to Rs 60,000, he added. 

Average salaries in engineering functions are higher at Rs 30,000 while that in roles in administration customer service, manufacturing and tech support ranged from Rs 16,000 to Rs 18000, Mr Rakyan said. 

Comparatively, graduates in Singapore may be earning more than five times that that of their Indian peers, Mr Rakyan said. Even in China entry-level salaries on a dollar-to-dollar basis in IT and manufacturing are 40 per cent more that offered in India, he said, adding that salary across different countries depend factors like cost of living and labour market, he added.  

On the other hand, the starting salary for MBAs in India is Rs 40,000, Mr Rakyan said.

3599,"The Government of India is proposing to lease 40% of the country’s forests, classified as “degraded”, to private companies to improve and restore forest landscapes. Earlier this week, the All India Forum of Forest Movements (AIFFM) put out a statement opposing this proposed privatisation of India’s forests. Last month, India’s Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change issued guidelines on “Participation of Private Sector in Afforestation of Degraded Forests”. The AIFFM statement notes that the proposal is in breach of several statutes including the Forest Rights Act, the Panchayat Extension to Scheduled Area Act, the Indian Forest Act, and the Forest Conservation Act. While the Ministry of Environment’s guidelines mention safeguards for forest rights and protecting tribal interests, the guidelines allow no space for community involvement. The Hindustan Times reports that the guidelines state that: It has been felt that ongoing national afforestry programmes have not been able to make the desired impact in improving productivity and quality of forest cover due to a lack of sufficient investment, capacity, technological upgradation and adequate skilled manpower.
 
Thus there is need to look at options including how private sector can contribute in improving and restoring forest landscapes apart from meeting the vital requirement of various forest products. But as the AIFFM points out “improving and restoring forest landscapes” in reality will involve establishing industrial tree plantations. India’s pulp and paper industry has been lobbying for decades to get its hands on the country’s degraded forests. A former director of the Indian Institute of Forest Managment in Bhopal commented to the Hindustan Times, “Even the most degraded natural forests have 50-100 species of trees per hectare. For their end products, industries would hardly plant one or two species.” These “degraded” forests are also crucially important for rural communities. Dr N. C. Saxena was a member of India’s Planning Commission. In a paper titled “Tenurial Issues in Forestry in India”, Saxena argued against handing over degraded forests to private companies: Such lands may have a low tree density, but satisfy the fuelwood, fodder and livelihood needs of about 100 million people. In fact, these lands are degraded because they suffer from extreme biotic pressure, and require neither capital investment, nor higher technology, but protection and recuperation, which can be done only by working with the people, where industry has neither expertise nor patience. The West Bengal experience shows that about 2000 peoples’ forest protection committees have regenerated more than 300,000 hectares of sal forests at little extra investment, simply by protection on the promise of sharing wood and non-wood products with them. If lands on which peoples’ livelihoods are dependent are given to industry, they may have to employ muscle power to keep people at bay, thus escalating social tensions, which are already quite acute in several forest and park areas. In April 2014, the Ministry of Environment published a draft National REDD+ Policy and Strategy. One of the objectives of the REDD+ Policy is, to lay emphasis on achieving various thematic elements of SMF by addressing the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation, afforestation of degraded areas, protection measures, etc. while implementing the REDD+ programmes Because of the failure to differentiate between industrial tree plantations and forests, the pulp and paper industry’s monoculture tree plantations would slot neatly into India’s proposed REDD plans, as “afforestation of degraded areas”. Our Forests are not for Sale! Stop Privatizing India’s Forests!  
A Press Release by All India Forum of Forest Movements(AIFFM)
 
21 September 2015
 
Recent guidelines sent by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) to state governments and UTs [Union Territories], confirm that Government of India has finally made up its mind about allowing ‘forest concessions’ to private sector companies in what it perceives as state-owned forests. We learn from various media reports and the leaked guidelines that 40 percent of ‘identified’ degraded forests could be given away on lease to private companies for raising plantations, and as the Minister Prakash Javadekar has said, to bring back forests where there were no forests. The same minister has earlier this year remarked that ‘diversion of forests’ is a negative phrase, it should be replaced with ‘reforestation’, because aren’t the agencies who use forest lands for activities such as mining, dam-building and tourism paying for compensatory afforestation, in other words, raising new forests?
 
The Minister represents his government in what he has been saying, and whatever decisions his Ministry has been taking for last 16 odd months, follow a conscious pattern.
 
The pattern is simple. The present Government of India, which means the Indian state, is intent on neo-liberalizing the environment. Going by experiences from across the world, that means destroying it altogether, or changing and maiming it solely in the interest of capital. Environment and business, environment and investment, environment and development must go together, we are told daily. Environment must not impede growth, we are reminded.
 
Because state always knows best, what the law says does not matter. The idea of handing over so-called degraded forests to corporations violates not one but several statutes such as Forest Rights Act and PESA, and also Indian Forest Act and Forest Conservation Act. The first two stipulate that communities and community institutions such as gram Sabha will determine the future use of forests and forest land. The next two, taken together, have no provision for privately owned or leased ‘state’ forests. The MoEF guidelines mention safeguards for forest rights, and protecting tribal interests. In the same breath, they allow no space for community intervention in the entire process, and limit community use of future leased out forests to only 10-15 percent of the total leased area. Finally, and most importantly, plantations are not forests: irrespective of species being planted, a plantation can not replace or in any way replicate the biodiversity even a so-called degraded natural forest support, and the sustenance they provide to local communities.
 
The Government can not change laws at will. Its executive powers do not extend to amending them, or changing them in such a way that the constitutional and legal essence of such laws are altered. Yet the present government keeps on doing precisely this; realising that they lack the requisite majority in parliament for amending the statutes, a governance through decrees, ordinances and executive fiat is replacing the rule of law altogether.
 
The Government has also recently announced an unbelievable 15 billion US$ package for new plantations, which, it was said, the government already had. On top of that, the government needs yet more money for plantations? What is the game that is being played, really?
 
We apprehend that the ambitious and now corporatized plantation programme of the present government will be used to greenwash its emphasis on coal mining, and continuing with coal as the primary source of electricity generation, in international climate negotiations. The proposed private plantations can also be used in the dubious game of domestic carbon trading. It also follows logically that that the present scheme of allowing private plantations inside reserved forests will also be shown in future as a REDD plus activity because it will help restock the depleting carbon stores in degraded forests.
 
In reality, the plantations will disempower and dispossess people, not only through land grab, but also by promoting more new mining throughout our forests.
 
We protest against these undemocratic and underhand exercises of commoditising nature, the conspiracy of deliberately undermining the power of grassroots communities over the nature they use and live with. Forests are not meant for corporate profit, they are life support systems. Degraded forests must be identified and regenerated and restored, democratically and ecologically, through the agency of communities and their gram sabhas. They can not be, under any circumstances, given away to corporations.
 
We call for an unified resistance against the machinations of the government, in defense of our forest commons.

598,"NEW YORK -- Theatergoers who check out ""Beautiful"" on tour won't get to see Tony winner Jessie Mueller but they may get the next best thing -- someone with her DNA. 

Mueller's older sister Abby has stepped into her sister's shoes to play Carole King in the Broadway musical about the celebrated ""I Feel the Earth Move"" songwriter. 

Abby Mueller acknowledged she was ""a little hesitant"" to audition for a part that earned her sister a best-actress Tony Award last year. 

""I'm really glad my agent convinced me to and I'm really glad they saw something in me. I've just been having the best time doing this,"" said Abby Mueller. ""As soon as I got the audition, I called Jessie. I was like, 'I've got a funny story for you.'"" 

Jessie and Abby Mueller are just the tip of the talented, Chicago-based Mueller family. Their brothers, Matt and Andrew, as well as their parents, Roger Mueller and Jill Shellabarger, are all actors. 

""Beautiful"" director Marc Bruni said Abby, who graduated from Indiana University and has been on Broadway in ""Kinky Boots,"" earned the job with her skills. 

""We did not set out to specifically cast within the Mueller family. Abby is an extraordinary talent in her own right,"" he said. 

""She is creating her own version of Carole that has all of the emotional resonance and all of the truthful acting that comes with the Mueller family and their amazing accessibility of emotion."" 

The tour kicks off in Providence, Rhode Island, on Tuesday. It makes stops in North Carolina, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Illinois, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Florida, Georgia, Texas, California and Colorado. 

One of the tour's highlights for Mueller will be spending the holidays and New Year's Eve in Chicago. ""It's going to be awesome. I'm thrilled,"" she said. ""I haven't been home for Christmas in years."" 

The musical tells the story of King and her first husband, Gerry Goffin, who together composed some of the greatest pop singles of the early 1960s, including The Shirelles' ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow,"" the Drifters' ""Up on the Roof,"" Bobby Vee's ""Take Good Care of My Baby"" and Little Eva's ""The Loco-Motion."" 

Book writer Douglas McGrath intertwines the story of King and Goffin with that of their friends and avid competitors, the songwriting team of Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, which opens another treasure trove of pop hits like ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'"" and ""Walking in the Rain."" 

Audience members get some history -- and some killer tunes. ""You learn something and you have your heart warmed. And you also have this catalog of music that is just unparalleled,"" said Bruni. 

It will be the first time on the road for Mueller, but not for Liam Tobin, who plays Gerry Goffin. The Canadian-born Tobin toured western Europe in ""West Side Story."" 

He didn't see the Broadway version until after starting tour rehearsals and said he loves digging into a character who struggles with mental illness and guilt. 

""It's been a real treat to go somewhere else with a character than just your classic leading man,"" he said. ""It's really a privilege to really dig in to something like Gerry."" 

Mueller, who grew up listening to King's landmark album ""Tapestry"" and recently met the songwriter, has been trying to tap into King's honesty and vulnerability. 

""Trying to do anything to be like Carole is instantly going to ring false,"" she said. ""Hopefully, when you're going for that truth and honesty, those are the essence that made people love Carole and hopefully that essence is what's going to carry the show.""

1652,"MONZA, Italy — Formula One tire supplier Pirelli blamed debris on the track and prolonged usage for a ""highly unusual number of cuts"" at the Belgian Grand Prix, which was marred by frightening tire deterioration on the cars of Sebastian Vettel and Nico Rosberg.

Pirelli released findings Thursday from its investigation into the incidents two weeks ago, with practice at the Italian GP beginning Friday.

In Spa, the right rear tire of Vettel's Ferrari was torn to shreds at 320 kph (200 mph) in the penultimate lap. That came two days after the same thing happened to Rosberg in practice, prompting the Mercedes driver to demand action from Pirelli before Monza.

""Tests have shown that the failures at Spa were down to the exceptional combined effect of debris on the track and prolonged tire usage on a circuit that is particularly demanding,"" Pirelli said in a statement.

The company said the debris was left over from numerous accidents in support races that surrounded the centerpiece F1 event.

""In order to guarantee greater safety, Pirelli proposes with the FIA to undertake a study to optimize the way in which circuits are cleaned,"" the tire supplier said.

There were 63 cuts in the tires at the Belgian GP, compared to an average of 1.2 cuts per circuit in the previous 15 events — also including tests.

""All this indicates an anomalous amount of detritus on the track in Spa, with a consequent increased risk of encountering a foreign object,"" Pirelli said.

Ferrari used a single pit-stop strategy which added stress on the tires. A statement from governing body FIA based on Pirelli's conclusions said the remaining tread thickness on Vettel's rear tires ""was approximately 30 percent at the time of the failure, making the tire more susceptible to damage from even small pieces of debris.""

Rosberg's incident was blamed on a cut that reached the belt of his tire.

The conclusions will do little to alleviate concern ahead of the race in Monza, which is F1's fastest circuit.

Still featuring long straight sections from an old oval track, speeds at Monza can exceed 360 kph (220 mph). The premium on straight-line speed means teams use minimal wing resistance, forcing drivers to brake more heavily.

""The FIA is satisfied with the thoroughness of the investigation and Pirelli's conclusions,"" the governing body said. ""Based on this, the FIA is willing to consider any safety recommendations made by the tire supplier for the Italian GP and for the remainder of the season.""

211,"Though we are only just now entering the ninth month of 2015, Milwaukee has already surpassed last year's murder rate by a startling amount. 104 people have been killed in the city this year, greatly exceeding the 59 lives lost during the same period in 2014 and easily eclipsing that year's total of 86 homicides. According to new data, Milwaukee's seemingly sudden increase in violence is part of a larger national trend represented in statistics compiled by the New York Times:Law enforcement experts are unsure what exactly is causing the dramatic spike in homicides across many major U.S. cities, though they do believe ""disparate factors are at play in different cities."" Maddeningly, the New York Times reveals that ""some officials"" are claiming that the renewed scrutiny facing the increasingly detrimental problem of police brutality has ""made officers less aggressive and emboldened criminals."" Thankfully, most experts vehemently disagree with this theory.Though murder rates in New York and Chicago hit record lows in 2014, both rates have shown a notable increase in the first eight months of 2015. New York is currently experiencing an estimated increase of nine percent, with Chicago doubling that rapidity with a 20 percent increase. Garry McCarthy, the police superintendent in Chicago, believes that the widespread prevalence of guns is largely to blame. ""Across the country, we’ve all found it’s not the individual who never committed a crime before suddenly killing somebody,” says McCarthy. “It’s the repeat offenders. It’s the same people over and over again.”Yxc2s3cjqfuKECan08hQUpV19NJzHcH3 ",50548a2a-cf05-4b7b-8453-2e4b973ddfff,Blog,2015-09-01T14:55:53Z,all,"Milwaukee, Baltimore, Chicago, and Other Major U.S. Cities Are Experiencing a Dramatic Spike in Homicides",1.0,News
3358,"(BPT) - An estimated 2.7 million Americans suffer from atrial fibrillation (AFib), an irregular heartbeat and the most common form of cardiac arrhythmia, according to the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. Surprisingly, many people do not feel any symptoms until they are suffering from complications of AFib such as heart failure or stroke. 
  
September is Atrial Fibrillation Awareness Month. Take the time to understand your risk for AFib, and the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. One out of every four strokes in the United States is a result of AFib, according to the American Heart Association. Patients who experience a stroke caused by AFib are twice as likely to be severely disabled, a 1996 Framingham Study found. Stroke prevention and heart failure prevention are primary treatment goals in AFib. 
 
Who is at risk for AFib? 
 
There are a number of risk factors associated with AFib, including existing heart conditions, prior heart attack or recent heart surgery. People who are overweight, have high blood pressure, lung or thyroid issues or are under a lot of stress may also have an increased risk for AFib. 
 
Additionally, the risk for AFib increases with age, especially after 60. There is also a genetic component to AFib, so if someone in the family has it, the more likely the next generation will have it too. Without treatment, AFib can lead to serious health consequences, including: 
 
* Heart failure 
 
* Stroke 
 
* Fatigue 
 
* Shortness of breath 
 
What are the symptoms of AFib? 
 
Each year, millions of patients see physicians because they feel heart palpitations or report their heart is racing, quivering or fluttering, which are the most common symptoms of AFib. Other signs may include general fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath, anxiety or weakness. However, some people with “silent” AFib have no symptoms at all and their condition is only detected when they go in for a physical exam or have a medical event. In fact, a third of Americans who have AFib are still undiagnosed, noted a 2015 report from the American Heart Association. 
 
Early diagnosis and treatment is key 
 
Early detection of AFib is critical to reduce unnecessary medical visits and prevent serious complications. However, AFib can occur intermittently or without symptoms, making it difficult to detect and diagnose. 
 
If a physician suspects AFib, they will typically conduct a physical examination and heart-monitoring tests. Traditional heart monitoring methods include an electrocardiogram (ECG) to measure the timing and duration of each electrical signal of the heart. 
 
New advancements in technology such as wireless, long-term, continuous cardiac monitors have significantly improved how AFib is diagnosed and managed. For example, iRhythm’s ZIO Service with a biosensor patch has the ability to monitor and store patients' heartbeats for up to 14 days, catching any hard to detect events that may be missed with older technology. The long-term continuous monitoring allows physicians to rule in, or even rule out, the diagnosis and characterization of AFib and potentially eliminating the need for further testing and resulting in faster treatment. 
 
Talk to your doctor 
 
While AFib may not sound serious, it can actually be life threatening. Understand your risk and treatment options, and take the necessary next steps to live a healthier lifestyle, including eating heart healthy foods, exercising regularly and minimizing stress.

3027,"IBM ( NYSE:IBM ) 
      and Omlis, the emerging market leader for mobile security technology 
      today announced the release of their Secure 
      Enterprise Messenger (SEM) encryption technology on the IBM 
      SoftLayer platform. The downloadable Omlis Secure Enterprise Messenger 
      technology is now available on the IBM Cloud Marketplace to app 
      developers who employ IBM SoftLayer technologies for their backend 
      infrastructure, providing them with a highly secure synchronous request 
      response model of sensitive data exchange between client and server 
      applications over untrusted networks. 
 
IBM’s acquisition of SoftLayer in 2013 for approximately $2 billion 
      confirmed their ambition to lead the enterprise cloud market space, 
      taking advantage of the growing trend as large organisations began 
      outsourcing the management of their IT systems while providing smaller 
      organisations with cost effective, reliable and scalable computing 
      power. With Omlis Secure Enterprise Messenger technology, IBM have a 
      solution to suit a wide variety of applications and customers across 
      their Cloud Marketplace, SoftLayer and BlueMix platforms. 
 
Mobile malware remains a significant cybersecurity threat, with 1.12 
      percent of mobile devices monitored by IBM Trusteer in the first half of 
      2015 exhibiting an active malware infection, on par with PC infection 
      rates. 
 
The increase of Man-in-the-middle attacks, Trojans, Viruses, Worms, 
      Spyware and many others signifies the growing shift in cybercriminal 
      resource and attention to the mobile channel. 
 
With protocols like SSL and TLS created before the ubiquitous mobile 
      channel, most mobile applications are vulnerable to at least one of 
      these known attacks especially as these applications do not employ the 
      appropriate level of security. The Omlis Secure Enterprise Messenger 
      encryption downloadable on the IBM Softlayer ensures that every 
      application has its own uniquely encrypted data exchange channel, 
      eliminating any opportunities for data leakage. 
 
The Omlis Secure Enterprise Messenger is built on the IBM SoftLayer and 
      marks a new era for secure communication technologies, providing mobile 
      application developers with significantly higher data exchange security 
      compared to multi-tenanted SaaS. 
 
“Omlis brings to market a high integrity encryption that is totally 
      secure, massively scalable, delivering the greatest operational 
      efficiency and offering the most compelling Return on Investment (ROI) 
      and engaging mobile commerce experience,” said John Stuart, Chief 
      Commercial Officer at Omlis. 
 
Mr Stuart also added, “The highly differentiated Omlis Architecture and 
      portfolio of solutions are designed to completely eliminate the 
      opportunity for fraudulent transactions and are unrivalled in the 
      marketplace.” 
 
The availability of the Omlis Secure Enterprise Messenger encryption 
      technology on IBM’s SoftLayer supports IBM’s offensive strategy and 
      priorities around the Internet of Things (IoT). Through SoftlLyer, IBM 
      have created a common platform where developers are empowered to create 
      useful applications for the growing network of connected devices and the 
      availability of the Omlis Secure Enterprise Messenger is aimed to 
      increase developer confidence in the absolute security of any data 
      exchanged to and from their mobile applications.

But in order for him to break through for Grand Slam No. 18—and his first since 2012—he'll need to be at his very best against the top-seeded Serbian. 
 
Let's look closer into the matchup and break down how to watch it. 
 
  
  Novak  Djokovic vs. Roger Federer  
Date and Time:  Sunday, Sept. 13 at 4 p.m. ET 
 
TV:  ESPN 
 
Live Stream:  WatchESPN 
 
  
 Preview  

 
Just about any way you slice it, Djokovic vs. Federer has been a push for much of their respective careers. 
 
As expected, the duo are almost neck-and-neck in terms of career wins—Federer has 21, and  Djokovic is right behind him with 20. But it stretches further than that, as Djokovic has a slim 16-14 lead when playing on hard courts. 
 
The two are tied 6-6 in hard-court finals, but Djokovic has had a decisive advantage in best-of-five major contests against Federer over the last several years. From 2010 to the present, Djokovic is 3-0 against Federer in hard-court Grand Slam affairs. 
 
In none of those contests, however, did Federer put together the level of consistency that he's shown over this fortnight in Queens. In not dropping a single set in this tournament, Federer has done something only previously accomplished four times as ESPN Stats & Info noted: 
 

 
But it's no secret that he'll be hard-pressed to keep up his winning ways through Sunday, much less at that straight-set pace that he's been working on. The 28-year-old Djokovic is in his absolute prime, playing incredibly and looking rather unbeatable in a best-of-five setting. 
 

 
While he's got dozens of experiences with Djokovic to scout from, feelings from Federer's camp are that he's simply playing well enough to get there as co-coach Stefan Edberg told  New York Times ' Christopher Clarey : 
 
“I mean, obviously, things change when you get older, but he has the tools that are necessary to take you all the way,"" Edberg said. ""Hopefully, he can keep it going here. He’s playing well enough to have a shot.” 
 
At 34, Federer undoubtedly isn't the player that he was four or five years ago, when he was around Djokovic 's age and level of play. But he's revitalized his style and play to stay ahead of the curve, and despite an emergence of many other players, Federer has remained Djokovic 's chief rival. 
 
With 21 previous instances of defeat to look back on and a chance to become a three-time major champion in a single season, don't expect that to slip Djokovic 's mind as he prepares for Sunday's duel.

4483,"This post is brought to you by Interac® Association and SheKnows Media. When’s the last time you used your credit card? Yesterday? The day before that? While credit cards make life easier, they also make it easier to accumulate debt. Debt is the enemy of financially savvy Moms and Dads. With news that Canada is now in an official recession your personal household debt is now more than ever something you really need to pay attention to. Here are a few ideas for ways to help stay on top of debt this season. Five Simple Ways to Stay on Top of Debt 1. Cancel the credit cards. This is going to be hard, but take it from me. Nothing generates a bigger debt load faster than credit card use. Pick one credit card and keep it for emergencies. That’s it. Pay it off every month if able. (That’s the best option). When we upsized to a new home last year and we applied for a new mortgage the bank asked us to get rid of all but one of the credit cards. That was hard for me because strange as it sounds I had a small emotional attachment to one of the cards that I received as a student and often charged BIG purchases like trips to. They were right. I cut up and cancelled all the credit cards but one and our new home was much easier to pay for. Plus really nobody needs more than one credit card. It should be your emergency card only. It’s easier to enjoy life without a huge debt hanging over your head. 2. Stop Impulse Buys When Able. The smallest things done daily cost a lot of money (and really aren’t very good for your health sometimes either.) I just returned from a week at the cottage and I bought two specialty coffees while there on vacation. Prior to that, I had not bought a specialty coffee in about 6 months. I stopped purchasing expensive handmade cappuccinos and things like that when I committed to saving and also taking control over my weight. So financial health and physical health in one fell swoop. I also allow myself a treat on vacation because that keeps me better able to adhere to my plan the rest of the year. 3. Bundle and Negotiate People don’t believe me sometimes when I tell them this, but I negotiate everything. EVERYTHING. I bundle services to get better deals. I switch providers if I want to save money. I occasionally call places like my bank, or my Internet and cell phone provider and say – “I have been your loyal customer since 1985…what can you do for me?” When we moved to London several years ago I asked the bank to waive all service fees on my new account. They did that for one year. I saved a lot that year. It was important then because we had just bought our first house. I do the same thing when negotiating mortgage. I am never afraid to walk. I can take my mortgage and move it to the next guy who offers lower rates. Saving money matters more than my loyalty to one bank or mortgage agent. 4. Keep a Few Rewards Cards on Hand for Purchases I think I have talked about this before. I have a mad love for a couple of specific rewards cards here. One is Shoppers Optimum. I accumulate points there fast and have used that card to buy many big birthday presents and Christmas presents. The rewards pay out fast. Right now I have over $200 in free product waiting for me there again. An Air Miles card comes in handy too. Pick a maximum of five. PC is a good one here in Canada too. I saved $20 on my groceries yesterday with that reward card. The rest of those rewards cards are not always useful and they add clutter to your wallet sometimes. I can live without that. Just keep the ones that pay out quickly. 5. Use Interac®  Debit.  Take the Interac® 21 Day Credit-Free Challenge With Me I carry a small amount of cash. I use my Interac® Debit card otherwise. Right now you can join me in the Interac 21 Day Credit-Fee Challenge. This challenge is aimed at helping Canadians live better by being debt free. Life is better when you don’t have to worry about debt. The easiest way to avoid debt is by using your own money. Avoid using credit cards to make purchases. The credit card bill is a budget killer and it can also be a punch in the gut. That’s what the Interac® 21 Day Credit-Free challenge is all about – avoiding the sucker punch. Living well and within your means is possible.

1826,"“Undocumented: A Dominican Boy’s Odyssey from a Homeless Shelter to the Ivy League,” by Dan-el Padilla Peralta. Penguin Press, New York, 2015. 312 pages. $27.95. Dan-el Padilla Peralta’s journey from the Dominican Republic to the United States when he was 4 years old was intended to be one leg of a round-trip. But his mother’s complicated pregnancy kept the family in New York City longer than expected. By the time she was well enough to return to Santo Domingo with Dan-el, his father and new brother Yando, she reconsidered. They would stay put, she said, in part for the sake of the children’s educations. People had begun to notice that Dan-el was an exceptionally bright and motivated boy. “Undocumented: A Dominican Boy’s Odyssey from a Homeless Shelter to the Ivy League” is Peralta’s memoir about being a gifted but undocumented student. He is a young scholar now, teaching the classics at Columbia. His book will speak for the many who, because of their illegal status, dare not speak for themselves. “Undocumented” is far from a political screed. Peralta lets his personal narrative — told with an attractive mix of youthful bravado, humor, humility and angst — illustrate the human side of the immigration issues we have yet to resolve in the United States. Peralta portrays himself as a thoughtful, fun-loving, intellectually curious student with a competitive drive. But he is made uncharacteristically cautious by circumstance. It isn’t until he is a senior at Princeton that he finds the courage to tell his friends about his undocumented status. Peralta’s story can be read as a chronicle of one smart student’s acquisition of an education. But it plays out against the backdrop of homelessness, inhospitable shelters, poverty, fear and lack of papers. Because Peralta is so gifted, his situation can’t be viewed as emblematic of the problems immigrants confront. He lived a double life, moving adroitly between prep school and public housing, between hours immersed in the Greek and Roman classics in America’s most hallowed educational institutions and the private, agonizing hours spent facing the dire implications of his undocumented status. Despite his rarified experiences in academia, reality bore down and began to strangle his options, one by one. Of course he couldn’t be a work-study student and get a paycheck because he had no Social Security number, nor could he leave the country for junior study abroad. If he were to take advantage of the opportunity to study at Oxford, he might not get back into the United States for 10 years. He says, in a recent interview on CSPAN, that his early memories are infiltrated by foreboding, anxiety, unease and dislocation. Page 2 of 2 - Many generous people stepped up to help Peralta, beginning with a young photographer named Jeff who spotted the young boy’s intelligence and who initiated a number of strategic measures to help him gain admission to Collegiate, a lauded prep school in New York City. Peralta did his part. He worked hard as a student ultimately moving from prep school through Princeton, Oxford and Stanford. He studied and mentored over summer vacations, feeling energized by learning, steeped in gratitude and humbly indebted. According to the CSPAN interview, he is still not a fully legal resident. Peralta’s story is significant and universal because he has been an exemplary member of society. He, like most immigrants, is not bent on exploiting the system. He is part of this society that he has life bonds with, and he offers his own unique contributions. As a teacher and mentor of the young, he touches many lives every day. In the Epilogue, we learn that many undocumented students contact him with questions about how to gain legal status. He knows his example is not easily transferable, but there is something about his persistence that is. And Peralta’s example, however special, resonates with the kind of gumption and hopefulness that we recognize as the American spirit. Even with the support of former President Clinton and George W. Bush, among others of high esteem, Peralta has been denied a clear path to citizenship. “Undocumented” leads readers to wonder: What about all the other immigrants, those who do not learn Latin and memorize Whitman? New York, where Peralta lived as a child and lives now, is a beautiful example of the depth of riches derived from a diverse and lively population. Peralta’s “Undocumented,” set primarily in New York City, brings this wealth of talent to life for those who choose to see it. From the vantage point of “Undocumented,” the hurdles for immigrants are daunting and depressing. Even presidents cannot make exceptions to a problem locked down and frozen by Congress’s resistance to negotiate despite our citizens’ demands to find fair and humane solutions. We as a people cannot seem to break free from the hatred, prejudice and absence of generosity. Yet Peralta finds wisdom and comfort in the humanities he now teaches, and whose lessons he shares in “Undocumented.” People like Peralta are part of the solution.

1254,"In the week when leadership has been the talking point around the nation former Australian captain Michael Clarke said he retired at the end of the Ashes satisfied he did everything expected from a leader. 

Follow SMH Sport on Twitter

In the week when leadership was the talking point around the nation, former Australian captain Michael Clarke said he retired at the end of the Ashes satisfied he did everything expected from a leader.

""I gave my all,"" said Clarke of the role described as the nation's second-most important job after the Prime Minister. ""I wouldn't swap anything, I would've loved to have finished with an Ashes series victory but it wasn't to be.

""You can only do your best, that's what [leadership] comes down to. If you do your best and it's not good enough, then it's not good enough. I think what you have to understand is you're accountable.

""For me, it was results. If we lost I always expected to be held accountable. You need to expect a few smacks in the mouth along the way but you have to get up.""

As his successor Steve Smith prepares for his first series as skipper, Clarke - who led Australia to a World Cup victory over New Zealand earlier in the year - said the scrutiny failed to dampen his love for the job.

""It's an honour and privilege to be captain,"" he said. ""I know people say that when they get the opportunity but don't necessarily feel that at the end of their careers, but I do. I gave it everything I had and my teammates did the same.""

As Australia's 43rd Test captain Clarke led Australia on 47 occasions, winning 24 Tests, losing 16 and drawing seven for a winning percentage of 51.06. While he is happy to allow others to ""dictate"" the successes and failings of his career, he is proud his players respected his approach.

""You need to be open and honest,"" he said. ""My decisions were never personal, they were always based on what was best for the team, and I think my teammates respected that.

""I never made it personal. I made it about the team and if someone didn't pull their weight and I didn't see it, I had good leadership in our group who'd pick that player up.

""I think that's really important in the Australian team, you work hard, you put the team first. That culture has stuck for a long time and must continue to stay there. You need good players around you because you can't do everything as captain - you need help and support and I was fortunate to have that.""

Clarke, who admitted he didn't watch Australia play England during the recent one-day series, said he didn't enter the Ashes knowing it would be the last series of a career in which he played 115 Tests and 245 one-day internationals.

""My goal was to help Australia win [the World Cup and Ashes] and to make a decision after that, but unfortunately it didn't go to plan,"" he said. ""Whether I would've retired or not if we won, who knows? Win or lose, I think the result might have been the same ...

""Life doesn't feel too different other than I haven't had to pick up a bat. I didn't watch any of the one-day series in England but I'm obviously pleased the boys won that series.

""Retirement has sunk in. I thought about it long and hard before I made my decision and because I know I've made the right decision it feels fine.

""I want the boys to go to Bangladesh and enjoy success. There's plenty of talent in that team, it's just going to take them time to play together and build that camaraderie. I know Australian cricket is in good hands, there's always been talent in our domestic system.""

Clarke, who has opened a coaching academy, will mentor and coach 40 young cricketers through a five-day live-in camp at Sydney's Scots College which starts on Sunday, and he vowed it won't be a holiday.

""It's five days of 6am until 7.30pm,"" he said. ""But it will provide a great insight into what it means – and takes - to play at the highest level.""

208,"Shares in Etisalat climbed 1.8 percent yesterday on the first day it opened up to foreign and institutional investors.

The UAE telco also saw its highest daily trading volume on record, with over 42 million Etisalat shares traded in one day.

The opening bell saw shares rise by 3.5 percent, dominating trading in Abu Dhabi, but eventually fell back to 1.8 percent. 

As the biggest listed company in the UAE, Etisalat is now very likely to secure a place in emerging market indexes, attracting global funds. Previously, only local retail investors could buy the stock. Etisalat has soared 22 percent since it announced the decision to open up to foreign investors three months ago. 

Dubai's benchmark stock index rose 0.7 percent, supported by a rebound in a number of stocks after several days of declines.

Property developer DAMAC jumped 3.5 percent ahead of a shareholder meeting later in the day which will vote on the firm's first cash dividend since it listed in Dubai in January.

Saudi Arabia's main index was nearly flat as banks offset losses in other sectors. National Commercial Bank and Al Rajhi climbed 1.4 percent each and were the main support for the market ahead of this week's meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which could result in a rise in interest rates.

The Saudi riyal is pegged to the dollar, so Riyadh is very likely to adjust interest rates as well, boosting banks' margins.

Sonny Wilson, a Liverpool solicitor, charged Legal Aid for barristers' and translators' fees on behalf of his clients when no such work was provided. 

﻿ 

Between 2012 and 2013, he misappropriated trust funds and made five false certifications to the service, which has struggled with federal funding cuts. Several times Mr Wilson told Legal Aid that barristers had appeared in court when Wilson himself represented his clients.

On Monday, the Civil and Administrative Tribunal found Wilson guilty of ""egregious"" dishonesty.

Mr Wilson, representing himself, did not formally oppose the removal of his name but asked for a suspension instead.

""I am willing to learn from my past mistakes and errors,"" he said in an affidavit. ""Hopefully I can obtain another opportunity in the near future to practice as a solicitor and to be of some use and benefit to others.""

The tribunal found his dishonesty was so extensive they had no option but to remove his name from the roll.

""Despite his good intentions, we are far from satisfied he has achieved this redemption in the relatively short time that has elapsed since his practising certificate was suspended,"" the tribunal panel wrote.

But the panel said Mr Wilson's chance to return to law ""may not be lost forever"". He is now studying full-time for a three-year degree in theology at Alphacrucis College in Parramatta.

The Seychelles Minister was being accompanied in his one-to-one press meetings by Stephane Perard, the Emirates Brazil Area Manager and Gisele Abrahao, the Owner of the Brazil representative office for the Seychelles Tourism Board. 
 
The day saw meetings with reputed Brazilian Magazines including VERSATILLE where Ricardo Battistini, the Owner of the magazine and Fran Oliveira, the Chief Editor (pictured with Minister St.Ange and Emirates Stephane Perard) discussed a Seychelles Report. 
 
“It is very clear that Seychelles is today a known tourism destination and when we realise that we have but launched Seychelles in Brazil but a couple of years ago, we can be happy that we have make a marked inroad in this market. Today it is the Maldives that is the flavour of the month, and they are being recorded as being amongst the top ten destinations for Brazilians as far as numbers go. Seychelles is set to become the next destination for Brazilians” said Minister St.Ange of the Seychelles. 
 
The press meetings all confirmed the same message to the Seychelles Minister and congratulated the island’s Brazil Office for keeping the flag of Seychelles flying high in Brazil.

1417,"Last Year, God Told Rick Joyner The New England Patriots Would Win The Super Bowl Submitted by Kyle Mantyla on Wednesday, 9/2/2015 12:02 pm On yesterday's ""Prophetic Perspective on Current Events"" program, Rick Joyner revealed that, prior to the start of last year's NFL season, God personally told him that the New England Patriots would win the Super Bowl and that it would be ""a prophetic message that patriotism is going to win this year."" Joyner said that God regularly shows him ""through sporting events some prophetic scenarios,"" and so, last year, he asked God when He was going to let the Carolina Panthers finally win a Super Bowl. God reportedly told Joyner ""don't give up on the Panthers,"" which Joyner interpreted to mean that the Panthers would not have a very good year but ""it could end up good,"" which is exactly what happened when the team made it into the playoffs despite having a losing record and even won a Wild Card game. But more importantly, God told Joyner that the Patriots would win the Super Bowl, though Joyner wisely decided not to share that information publicly because otherwise people would have used it to gamble. ""The Lord told me the Patriots were going to win,"" he said. ""I knew the Lord said and he was saying it as a prophetic message that patriotism is going to win this year.  And that's what's going to win and you're going to see Americans becoming patriotic again. And I knew that was a message and I think that's important for us to understand and, for that reason, I was kind of happy when the Patriots won it all, I knew we're going to see this unfold.""

Your heart may be older than you are - and that's not good. According to a new CDC Vital Signs report, 3 out of 4 U.S. adults have a predicted heart age that is older than their actual age. This means they are at higher risk for heart attacks and stroke. 

""Heart age"" is the calculated age of a person's cardiovascular system based on his or her risk factor profile. The risks include high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, diabetes status, and body mass index as an indicator for obesity. 
   
This is the first study to provide population-level estimates of heart age and to highlight disparities in heart age nationwide. The report shows that heart age varies by race/ethnicity, gender, region, and other sociodemographic characteristics 

CDC researchers used risk factor data collected from every U.S. state and information from the Framingham Heart Study to determine that nearly 69 million adults between the ages of 30 and 74 have a heart age older than their actual age. That's about the number of people living in the 130 largest U.S. cities combined. 

""Too many U.S. adults have a heart age years older than their real age, increasing their risk of heart disease and stroke,"" said CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H.  ""Everybody deserves to be young - or at least not old - at heart."" 

Key findings in the report include: 

Overall, the average heart age for adult men is 8 years older than their chronological age, compared to 5 years older for women. Although heart age exceeds chronological age for all race/ethnic groups, it is highest among African-American men and women (average of 11 years older for both). Among both U.S. men and women, excess heart age increases with age and decreases with greater education and household income. There are geographic differences in average heart age across states. Adults in the Southern U.S. typically have higher heart ages. For example, Mississippi, West Virginia, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Alabama have the highest percentage of adults with a heart age 5 years or more over their actual age, while Utah, Colorado, California, Hawaii, and Massachusetts have the lowest percentage. 
For more information, visit http://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease and http://www.cdc.gov/stroke . Visit millionhearts.hhs.gov to learn about Million Hearts, a national initiative to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes by 2017. 

Vital Signs is a report that appears on the first Tuesday of the month as part of the CDC journal, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. The report provides the latest data and information on key health indicators. These are cancer prevention, obesity, tobacco use, motor vehicle passenger safety, prescription drug overdose, HIV/AIDS, alcohol use, health care-associated infections, cardiovascular health, teen pregnancy, food safety, and viral hepatitis.

1453,"A man who was brutally attacked in Dublin’s Temple Bar area on Thursday night has died. 

The victim, understood to be from Dublin, had been seriously assaulted after being set upon at the Cow’s Lane area in Temple Bar at around 8.45pm on Thursday. 
 
Yesterday morning, as the man lay in a critical condition in St James’s Hospital, gardaí investigating the incident appealed to passers-by in the busy Dublin tourist district who videoed the assault on their smartphones to come forward with the evidence. 
 
Last night the man, in his mid-twenties, passed away in hospital. 
 
An autopsy will now be conducted, most likely today. 
 
However, gardaí said last night that they are still treating the case as one of serious assault, although they are awaiting the results of the autopsy. 
 
Three men in their mid-twenties were arrested at the scene at the attack on Thursday night, while a fourth man, aged in his thirties, was detained later in connection with the incident. 
 
They were still being questioned last night at Pearse Street, Irishtown, and Kevin Street Garda Stations under section four of the Criminal Justice Act. Investigating gardaí said they believe some people in Temple Bar had recorded the assault on their phones. 
 
As of last night, it was unclear if anyone with footage of the attack had come forward with the images and gardaí renewed their appeal to any persons who may have witnessed the incident or were in the vicinity of Cows Lane between 8.30pm and 9 pm, or who took images of the incident, to contact them at Pearse Street Garda Station.

3510,"Our work for clients involves a lot of website building and optimization, and we’re constantly finding that we repeat many of the same tasks whenever we get our hands on a new website. 

Many of the optimizations we perform come down to the fact that Google (and search engines in general) has a tendency to change the algorithms it uses to rank search results up to several times per year. What this means is that some factors become more important, while others lose their value. 

Based on the most recent changes in Google’s algorithm, we have come up with this extensive checklist that you can (and should) apply to every site you work on. Even if you’re working with an existing website, we strongly recommend you audit the content against our checklist. You may be surprised to find serious SEO mistakes in older articles and blog posts, so performing this kind of check can be hugely beneficial for your website. 
The On-Page SEO Checklist Short SEO and User-Friendly URLs 
If there’s one thing all SEO experts agree on, it’s that the URL is one of the biggest on-page factors that you can influence. Ultimately, your aim for every URL on your site should be to have a short, yet keyword-rich and readable web address. 

Keep in mind that usually it’s the first 3-5 key terms in the URL that are given the highest importance by search engines, so make sure you use your target keywords in them. 
 Recommended for You Webcast: Fishing with Spears: All About Account-Based Marketing  Title 
The title of your content is also significant for your on-page SEO. You should always aim to use the desired keywords in the very beginning of your page’s title and also to keep it between 30 and 65 characters. You can’t go wrong by keeping it focused and short. 
Multimedia 
If content is king, then multimedia is definitely its queen. (And sometimes with infographics, videos, and other similar formats, multimedia does become content.) 

There is practical evidence that shows that the use of multimedia such as images and diagrams reduces the bounce rate of sites and also increases the average time people spend on them. Therefore, it would be hard to go wrong if you focus on selecting and using high-quality multimedia that accentuates your message. 
Outbound Links 
Don’t be afraid to use outbound links to relevant and high-authority websites in your niche (a couple is enough). The logic is that by making your content more helpful to readers (by providing links to other high-quality and highly relevant content on the same subject), you will increase the overall satisfaction of visitors with your content and this will be picked up by search engines. 
H1 Tag 
Never forget to wrap your title in a headline tag! Also, make sure you use the targeted term in a H1 tag. And again, keep it short—no more than 65-70 characters. 
First Paragraph 
Be sure to include your keyword once in the first 100-150 words, but don’t overuse it—including it once in the beginning is enough. 

Many people who use so-called “black hat SEO” tend to abuse this by mentioning the same keyword over and over again. So Google and other search engines have started to punish websites that appear to be practicing “keyword stuffing.” 
Speed Tests 
Google has always claimed that fast-loading pages perform better in search results than slow ones. Many tests exist that prove the same. We can’t stress enough the importance of checking the page speed of your site once you’re done optimizing it. 
Content 
This factor hasn’t changed since Day 1 of SEO. Content is king and it always will be. What has changed is search engines’ ability to analyze and discern quality content. Many experts forecast that search engines will soon reach a stage where they will be better able to predict the quality of a piece of content than a human. 

What this means for your site is that you should always invest in producing original and quality content. There’s also plenty of empirical evidence showing that users (and search engines) prefer longer content, so you should aim for producing at least 800-1000 words per page. 
Content Weight 
Each page could have more than a single focus. In fact you should always look to target so-called long-tail keywords, because they are much easier to rank for. 

However, for your main focus, the keyword density should be between 4-8% of the total content (i.e. the keyword should be mentioned 4-8 times for each 100 words). For the supporting keywords the target density is 2-3%. 
Attribute Tags 
Always make sure to add alt tags to the images on each page. Not only it will help with the SEO for the page (because Google pays attention to image alt tags), but it also has the potential to bring some extra traffic to your site. 
Schema Tagging 
Schema.org is an initiative by the leading search engines (Google, Bing, Yahoo!, and Yandex) to “create and support a common set of schemas for structured data markup on web pages.” This common vocabulary can be used to provide structured data to search engines on various types of content such as product reviews, and addresses. 

Schema is a great SEO tool that unfortunately still isn’t widely used by agencies for their clients. Make sure to tag all relevant assets on your website to gain an advantage over your competitors. 
Meta Description 
Even though it has been devalued by one of Google’s algorithm updates, meta descriptions are still an important part of SEO. This is the piece of content that is best tailored to be read by humans, so it has the potential to increase your click through rate in search results dramatically. 
Broken Links 
Always make sure to run tests for broken links on your website as they have the potential to hurt you badly by decreasing your ranking, causing high bounce rate, and providing bad user experience to your visitors. 

There are many ways to check for broken links, but our preferred one is by using Google’s Search Console (formally known as Google Webmaster Tools). 

Another good idea is to think about optimizing the template for your 404 page (i.e. the page visitors see when they reach a dead end on your site) in an attempt to keep some of the visitors who follow a broken link. 
Sitemap File 
Sitemaps are a crucial element of SEO, but especially for indexing pages that are not well linked and likely not to get indexed by search engines as a result of that (which also means they won’t be included in search engines’ rankings). 

We suggest that you use a dynamic sitemap instead of static one. This way, every time you publish new content, your sitemap will be updated and submitted to search engines, so that your new content gets indexed faster. 
Conclusion 
We hope that you will find this checklist helpful and informative, as we have aimed to give you the best and most actionable advice that you can apply to your site immediately. 

We would be curious to learn what effect using the tips above had on your sites, so let us know by sharing your experience in the comments.

2007,"SharkedFeature Articles by TJ Mott on 2015-09-15Edit »TJ MottI've been a developer for the past seven years. Currently I'm in the aerospace industry and work with a variety of programming languages and operating systems.Andrew M. worked at a small company in Kansas City called EtherTrode. With one facility and about 20 employees, they designed and built custom Ethernet hardware and drivers to fill niche roles where the common integrated chipsets weren’t good enough. Their hardware worked quite well, which attracted the attention of a multinational conglomerate called Initech. Initech puchased EtherTrode, rather than develop their own Ethernet devices. Like most others at EtherTrode, Andrew was a jack-of-all-trades. On any given day, he might be doing anything from customer support, to application development, to general office IT tasks, and even once a bit of soldering. It was the general office IT tasks that got Initech’s attention: he was selected to work with Initech on integrating their networks. The first phase went more-or-less smoothly. Initech shipped Andrew a pre-configured Cisco router, and instructions on how to connect it. After a weekend of integration, EtherTrode’s network now had a permanent VPN tunnel to Initech’s headquarters in Detroit. Phase One was boring. Yes, there were minor screwups and a few WTFs due to some miscommunication and unnecessary outsourcing, but that’s a variation on the same story that’s been told a million times before. Phase Two, however, was the Grand Slam over the foul line, lightning in the whiskey warehouse, the Cheese Shop without cheese, and a painful urination upon a subway’s third rail… … Active Directory Integration. Once the networks were connected, Initech wanted to terminate EtherTrode’s Active Directory domain and move all of their accounts and systems into Initech’s domain. Contractors working for Initech prepared a new domain server and shipped it to Andrew. He received the system, racked it the next weekend, and powered it on. Everything seemed to work, and local systems joined to Initech’s domain without issues. Come Monday morning, the office was ready to resume business. Things turned sour around lunchtime on Monday. All morning, employees had complained about poor network performance. Their emails failed to send, and new messages failed to arrive. Tiny Subversion check-ins would fail more often than not, and even internal web pages took minutes to load- if they loaded at all. Worse still, Initech’s security officers had installed a new electronic lock system on EtherTrode’s building, which was connected to the LAN. By lunchtime, the locks refused to unlock, and Andrew had to physically unplug the controller unit in the server room to disable the lock so employees could actually enter and exit. The core staff of EtherTrode had an impromptu meeting shortly after lunch to discuss the issues. Lyle, another engineer, arrived late. “But I know what the problem is,” he explained. “I noticed the lights on our core switch were blinking like a strobe light in a tornado, so I fired up Wireshark.” A few of the engineers nodded, and Andrew wondered why he hadn’t thought of that. EtherTrode made Ethernet equipment, and Wireshark was an invaluable tool for examining the behavior of their devices and networks. It was the best way to make sure their hardware complied with Ethernet and TCP/IP standards, and it was really good at not interfering with their network while doing its monitoring. “In short,” Lyle explained, “there’s a device at 192.168.16.245 that’s issuing tens of thousands of broadcasts per second. The switches are dropping frames, and the IP stack on everyone’s workstation is working overtime processing irrelevant packets.” “254, you say?” Andrew said. He frowned. “That’s the IP address of our new domain server…” “Can we shut it down?” asked Ryan, their boss. “Rollback to how our network was last week?” Andrew shook his head. “I’ve already joined everything to the new domain. If we shut down the controller, no one will be able to log in or access network resources… not that they can now.” Lyle spoke up again. “The traffic looks pretty fishy. I think the server’s got some sort of malware on it. Can we log in and see what it’s doing? Run an antivirus or kill the process?” Andrew shook his head again. “Initech has it locked down tight. I can do some basic domain admin tasks, but I can’t actually log into the server.” “Alright,” Ryan said, visibly irritated, “Lyle, give me your Wireshark capture. I’m going to go down to the coffee shop for their wi-fi, and I’m going to forward it to Initech and raise some hell.” In the meantime, Andrew and Lyle went back to the switch. Since the broadcast was on a single port, they blocked that port at the switch. The server kept shouting its head off, but now the switch dropped the packets. Doing anything that required talking to the domain server- like logging in- was painfully slow and failed half the time, but the rest of the network worked fine. That bought them some time while they waited for a better solution from Initech. The next day, Andrew came in, grabbed a mug of coffee, and picked up the top priority support ticket. This one was a customer support issue. They had uploaded their own Wireshark capture to an FTP server. Andrew downloaded it so that he could see why their EtherTrode equipment was misbehaving. When he went to open the capture, Wireshark refused to start- or more accurately, it was no longer installed on his system. “That’s strange,” Andrew thought to himself. Maybe a Windows Update messed up the registry settings, or something, so Andrew redownloaded Wireshark and ran the installer. Or tried to. The installer refused to run. “This publisher has been blocked by your administrator,” explained the error message. As if on cue, his email client dinged and he was a new memo from the Initech IT department:TO: All Initech EmployeesSUBJECT: Re: Network Breach at KC FacilityOur new Kansas City facility had an unexpected network attack yesterday. We’ve analyzed the data and determined that a freeware application called Wireshark is to blame. This application caused severe issues with the facility’s security system and cannot be trusted. To prevent future attacks, we have globally blocked Wireshark via Group Policy and our antivirus suite. Wireshark is just malware and this decision will not affect day-to-day operations at any Initech facility. Andrew dropped his forehead right into his desk’s surface, and all around the office he heard a chorus of thumps as his fellow engineers did the same. Initech refused to flex on banning Wireshark, and refused to admit that anything could be wrong with their domain controller.

2545,"I just got home from an amazing trip to Beaver Creek, Colorado. 4 days up in the mountains at an amazing resort working on business and working on self with my Mastermind Group. My spirit and energy are feeling refreshed, rejuvenated, reenergized and raring to go. 
 
It was a special time up in the Rockies. We had approximately 70 fit pros from the TD Mastermind up in the mountains for our annual Fall Retreat. Besides these guys and gals coming from all over the country, we had one fit pro in from Australia (Scott Rawcliffe), one from Kuwait (Omar AlHamad), and one couple from north of the border (Duncan & Jenn Waller, Vancouver, CA).  The rest of the folks were from all over the country. 
 
While I have the opportunity to work with these great folks and the rest of their Mastermind teammates on a regular basis (on-line/virtually), there is NOTHING like a live meeting when we are all together. LIVE connect time is always BEST. 
 
The theme of our retreat this Fall was “ DREAM the imPOSSIBLE .”  I challenged the Mastermind attendees to dream big. And to put pen to paper as I facilitated some deep personal development & business exercises over 2-days. It went deep. 
 
I also shared my dreams. I shared my BHAG’s (big hairy audacious goals). I shared my best practices. And I shared what is most moving my soul today. 
 
And I encouraged them to do the same. We had time to write.To journal. To listen. To be inspired. 
 
And we took time to work-out. To swim. To hike. To get massages. And go in the hot tub. 
 
And we had time to DREAM. 
 

 
This week, the WOW is DREAM. 
 
You don’t need to go to a world-class resort like the Westin Riverfront Spa & Resort to DREAM (although it doesn’t hurt!  ). 
 
You can dream by: 
  Taking 10-20 minutes in the AM to journal and write down your DREAMS.  Getting out and going for a walk or run and listening to an inspirational podcast.  Visiting your local beach, nature-trail, mountain, or park and getting an outdoor workout.  Writing down your BIG 5 for Life & your BIG 5 for the Year . Your BIG 5 for Life ware the 5 things you want to achieve in your life. Your BIG 5 for the Year are the 5 things you want to achieve in the next year.   
Lastly, never underestimate the power of 2 more things: 
 
1.  Immersing yourself in a magical environment . When you put yourself in a “world-class” environment, it affects your mindset. You think world-class, you are exposed to world-class, and you THINK world-class. This can be at a resort, destination spot, or even a gym (like Fitness Quest 10  ). But seriously, this environment can be anywhere. It can be your home, your garden, or somewhere “simple” that stirs your spirit and moves your soul. 
 
2.  Surround yourself with “world-class” people. The folks in the Mastermind are world-class people. When I’m at Fitness Quest 10, the people are world-class, both teammates and clients. IT MATTERS! Who you put yourself around matters. Who your kids hang out with matters. Who YOU hang-out with matters. So spend more time with people thatbring out the BEST in you. And that support your dreams and visions. 
 
My friends, DREAM this week. Eat well. Train hard. Surround yourself with people that inspire you. Listen or read messages that inspireyou. Eliminate “head trash” and junk in your life that is holding you back. 
 
And go out and be the BEST that you can be. Dream big this week and take action steps that will massively support your dream to happen. #IWILL 
 
Much love…and many DREAMS. 
 
Todd

275,"RANDOM Hugh Sheridan sightings during the filming of Boar last month set more than a few hearts aflutter in the Gympie region, and now the Aussie star has further endeared himself to our region by talking us up on national television. 
 
He told Larry Emdur and Kylie Gillies - and all of Australia - on The Morning Show last week that when he first heard he would be filming for the horror film near ""Gympie"" he asked ""where's Gympie?"" 
 
""But we travelled around that region and it's actually really beautiful,"" he said in the interview. 
 
""It's amazing."" 
 
Hugh went on to tell Larry and Kylie he spent all of his down time during the filming exploring the region, especially nearby coastal spots and, as a few lucky locals experienced, the local watering hole and shopping centre. 
 
The multi-talented ""nice bloke"" is also - serendipitously - the face of the Nestlé Choose Wellness Movement, which encourages Aussies to improve their lifestyle through a balanced diet, regular exercise and a positive attitude. 
 
The Nestle factory in Pine St is a large employer and industry in Gympie. 
 
Hugh described Boar in the Morning Show interview as a ""crazy, exciting horror film"" and said John Jarratt actually plays a ""nice guy"" in the film, whereas he (Hugh) plays a character everyone will hope gets killed. 
 
Hugh is home from the United States to lead the Nestlé Choose Wellness Roadshow from now until October 10. 
 
He became a household name playing Ben Rafter on Packed to the Rafters, but is also an accomplished singer, dancer and wildlife warrior, and will this year compete in the New York Marathon for the Australian Wildlife Conservancy. 
 
The Nestlé Choose Wellness survey asked people from across the nation about their emotional and physical well-being and discovered Baby Boomers were the most physically active of any other generation and were one-third more likely to do physical activity than other generations.

Future took to Instagram on Monday (Sept. 14) to announce he will release a line of hats. The photo (below) shows the rapper sitting at a table intensely staring at his iPhone wearing a wide-brimmed hat in a store.

The rapper, whose real name is Nayvadius DeMun Wilburn, captioned his post announcing ""for the 1s who embrace individuality style, my hat line comin $oon.""

It appears this may be Future's attempt to dethrone Pharrell as the most widely known purveyor of wide-brimmed hats.

921,"In the 1st inning on Monday night, the Mets loaded the bases with nobody out. Perhaps two weeks ago an extended rally was certain, particularly with the team facing the completely moribund Braves. Now that the air has seemingly been let out of the Mets, it didn't seem like such a guaranteed proposition. Lucas Duda popped out for the first out. Travis d'Arnaud followed by hitting what looked like a sure Double Play ball right to Adonis Garcia at 3rd. I groaned, because at least that's what I figured would be the case. But Yoenis Cespedes slid hard into 2nd and took Daniel Castro out of the play, allowing d'Arnaud to reach and Curtis Granderson to score.
Lost in this play was Daniel Murphy, who had been running from 2nd to 3rd on the play and pulled up to try to avoid getting tagged out. However, Murphy then apparently decided he'd had enough of this and turned towards second to watch the play, as opposed to doing his job and continuing to run to 3rd. By time it dawned on him that he probably should have done that, it was unfortunately too late as Garcia threw back to Overratedton Simmons and Murphy was tagged out to end the inning, a rather odd but perfectly Murphian 5-4-6 Double Play.
In the 3rd inning, Jon Niese, who by this point had retired the first 8 Braves to face him, all on ground balls, walked Shelby Miller, the opposing pitcher. This was bad enough, but Shelby Miller, hitting .059 on the season is clearly a lousy hitter even for a pitcher. Michael Bourn followed by hitting a clean single through the right side. Castro followed by grounding to short, but Wilmer Flores' throw was a little wide and pulled Lucas Duda off the base at 1st and Castro was aboard on the error. By now, you probably had a good sense of where this was heading. Niese has made a career out of letting these minor irritants snowball into full-blown bloodbaths. This season, it's probably happened to him every other time he's taken the mound. Freddie Freeman, who was due for a good Met-killing moment, was coming to the plate. Everything was once again about to go haywire.
But it didn't. Freeman hit a rope to center that kind of knuckled a little bit, but Cespedes caught the ball and the Braves were turned away.
The Mets, in addition to their ill-gotten 1st inning run, had every opportunity to run Shelby Miller out of the building. Michael Conforto hit a Home Run in the 2nd inning, another opposite-field shot, as his power display continues to impress. Miller then came about as close to completely unraveling as you can, but the Mets ultimately let him off the hook. He walked Niese, walked Granderson and was honing in on 60 pitches in the 2nd inning. For Miller, a good pitcher, this season must be so demoralizing. He hasn't won a game in what, 22 straight starts? Somehow, he sucked it up and got through 6 innings, which is a credit to him.
So, Niese survived his attack of himself and managed to make it through 6 innings, although I think he may have been pre-emptively removed as he'd only thrown 87 pitches. Then again, with Niese, you try not to press your luck. Addison Reed threw a clean 7th inning. The Mets doubled their lead when Murphy double home 2 runs and remembered to keep running until he reached his intended base. Tyler Clippard returned to the mound with a mostly uneventful 8th inning (if you consider a hit and two Wild Pitches uneventful) and Jeurys Familia, though not in a Save situation, closed out a sanity-saving 4-0 victory.
This was my 20th game of the season at Citi Field, a lofty number that I haven't reached since 1999, and for those 20 games, this is the 13th the Mets have won. There becomes less and less to say about these games as the days wind down because basically, either the Mets win or the game stunk. Fortunately, the Mets won. The crowd seemed partially into things, which was OK. Last Monday, the game I was at was basically amateur hour because I found myself sitting around people that weren't paying attention to the game altogether. There were also about 12,000 fans there and this was a relevant team playing a relevant game. Of course, last week, the Mets were playing the irrelevant Marlins. Last night, the crowd was a bit heartier, even though they were playing the equally irrelevant Braves. I wonder if the fans are finally starting to develop a bit of a sense of urgency here. Lord knows the Mets could use the extra energy.",41d0959b-ba60-4f93-86c2-b86e644719c4,Blog,2015-09-23T04:00:11Z,The Ballclub,That's Much Better,1.0,News

216,"Members at Grove Baptist Church voted to oust Rev. Tim Mattox Sunday Last Friday Rev. Mattox bannished Genora Hamm Biggs, a member of 92 years, for saying she wasn't happy with his services  Rev. Mattox was sent a letter asking him to collect his things He then took out a restraining againt Biggs' grandson and another member   Hamm Biggs used to be a church officer, and her father was a founder  
Members of a northeast Georgia church have voted to fire a pastor who controversially banned a 103-year-old from the congregation after she disagreed with his services. 

The votes were cast Sunday against Reverend Tim Mattox, who have since issues him a 'Letter of Termination' asking him to remove his belongings from the Union Grove Baptist Church of Elberton. 

Rev. Mattox hit headlines last Friday after it was revealed he had banished Genora Hamm Biggs - a church member of 92 years - for displaying conduct that was 'detrimental' to others after she spoke out about his practices, including laying hands on members. 

According to The Atlanta Journal‑Constitution , Rev. Mattox has now taken a restraining order out against the grandson of Hamm Biggs, as well as a former church secretary.  

    
   
Genora Hamm Biggs, known as the 'mother of the church', has been going to Union Grove Baptist Church in Elberton since she joined it 92 years ago, but was banished last week for disagreeing with the pastor 

The outspoken Hamm Biggs, a retired teacher, said at the weekend that the practices used by Rev. Mattox were not Baptist. 

'He is a holy sanctified minister or so he says. We voted him in and we didn't know it until he was there. We are Baptists and that's what we want to stay,' Biggs said. 

A statement from the Union Grove church to the Athens Banner-Herald said fellow members decided to expel Hamm Biggs. 

'It was determined by the congregation during a church conference meeting, which Mrs. Biggs was present at the time of the meeting, that the behavior of Mrs. Biggs and others was detrimental to the church at large and could no longer be allowed,' according to the statement. 

Church members voted in August to revoke Hamm Biggs' membership, although she has continued attending services. 
 
Hamm Biggs was previously a church officer, and her father was one of its founders. She received a letter about her expulsion. 

'I was unhappy and shocked,' said Biggs. 'I joined the church when I was 11 years old.' 

Also banned from the church was Hamm Biggs' grandson, Eliott Dye, a member for 30 years, and Kevin Hamm, an ordained minister who was also a member of the church. 

Hamm said: 'I tried to talk with [Mattox] and he was just determined to say, 'You can't come over here, period.' 

Hamm Biggs said despite the ban, she still considers herself a member of the congregation. She attended the Sunday service last weekend.  
   
Hamm Biggs was left heartbroken after she received a letter in the mail from church members who banned her from stepping foot inside the church 
 
Hamm Biggs explained: 'He told police he wanted to put us out, but the police told him 'you can't do that' 

Hamm Biggs said the entire debacle unfolded after she told the Reverend Mattox she did not agree with his preaching style.  

But her complaints did not sit well with him. 

Soon after she voiced her opinion, the letter arrived. In the letter, sent by certified mail, Hamm Biggs learnt that her church-going privileges were being 'revoked.'  

It stated: 'Dear Mrs. Genora Hamm Biggs, This letter is to inform you that according to the by-laws of the Union Grove Baptist Church, and by vote of the active members, any membership or associations that you have had with this church are now officially revoked.  

'Therefore, you cannot attend Union Grove Baptist Church for any reason whatsoever. You are not to come to the property of the Union Grove Baptist Church located at 680 Pulliam Street, Elberton, Georgia 30635.  

Sincerely, The members and officers of the Union Grove Baptist Church.'  


The devout Christian was a former city clerk and a school teacher who taught first grade for 40 years.  

She says she prays daily but is having her faith tested  after she received the letter.  

And it got worse when she defied the church's orders and went back to worship. She said she was met by the frosty priest who wanted police to escort her out.  

Hamm Biggs said: 'The letter said we're not to come back, but we went back – police were there.'  

She told Fox Carolina : 'He told police he wanted to put us out, but the police told him 'you can't do that.' 

After that,  the pastor dismissed the service. The lights were turned off and Hamm Biggs was left sitting on the pew of a darkened sanctuary. 

'I was shocked. It was not a good feeling. I haven't seen anything like this before,' she said shaking her head. 
   
In the letter, sent by certified mail, it was signed by members and officers of the Union Grove Baptist Church' 
   
Hamm Biggs' name is etched on the side of the church, but she's been scarred by the entire bad experience 

Elberton police officers say it is a civil matter and have not made any arrests.  

Hamm  Biggs' grandson, Eliott Dye and Kevin Hamm say they are upset over the way Hamm Biggs was treated. 

Hamm told Online Athens : 'To disrespect a pillar and a mother of the church; how can we sit back and watch something like this go forward?' 

Her grandson describes his granny as 'outspoken'. He recalls an incident when  a  woman in the church called his grandmother 'Jezebel,' but she didn't hear what she'd said. 

He said: 'I never told her because her feelings would have been hurt. They have been so rude and I don't understand why it's been directed at my grandmother...[But] my grandmother can be pretty outspoken and that could have a lot to do with it.' 

The embattled centenarian, has, however, received the backing of quite a few of the church's 150 parishioners. 

Ezell Land, who used to be a deacon at the church, said the Hamm Biggs' family literally founded the church. He said quite simply: 'It's not right!' 

'They brought it here on a mule and a wagon from the country when I was a little boy,' Land said.  

Land also attended the church for 56 years before he decided to leave after a run-in with the pastor over his singing. 

'Every time I would get up, the pastor would get up and make remarks when I sang and stuff. So, I just got my hat and I left,' he said.

Hamm Biggs' name is etched on the side of the church, but she says she's been scarred by the entire experience.  

She never expected to be thrown out of a church she loved. 

'I wanna get my church straight like it has been,' she said sadly.  

Hamm Biggs is receiving widespread support from people on social media. Many have taken to the church's Facebook page to voice their disgust at the church's actions. 

Shataphy Baugns wrote: 'This is a disgrace to all the children of God....The devil is what you serve @ this church bless the elder lady soul. I pray God keep her covered and give her strength from the hurt she felt with this ridiculous decision made by this pastor.'

702,"(BPT) - Staying committed to a personal passion or goal requires motivation, discipline and confidence. All of which are qualities that Collier Kempton possesses. Despite being born with severe hemophilia A, an inherited bleeding disorder, Collier has remained dedicated to pursuing his interest in running and cycling. And along the way he has inspired others to do the same. 
  
Affecting approximately 20,000 people in the United States, hemophilia is a rare and life-long condition in which the blood does not clot normally.[1,2] Collier was diagnosed with hemophilia A, the most common form, at a very young age. With the strong support of his family, Collier didn’t let his hemophilia become a game changer. “I never let my condition put me in a box,” explains Collier. “I made sure to live my life and that has set me up for my future.” 
 
For Collier, a big part of his life has included competitive cycling. At 18-years-old, he competed in a duathlon, which involved both running and cycling. Now at the age of 24, running and cycling are still a big part of Collier’s life as he juggles working as a mechanic at a bicycle shop and coaching high school track. Most afternoons Collier can be found chasing his students at practice, coaching them to train harder and staying in shape himself. He uses his personal experiences to help inspire and build confidence in his team, as well as others with hemophilia. 
 
And to help him control and prevent bleeding while keeping active, Collier works closely with his healthcare team to determine the right treatment plan. He is currently uses XYNTHA® Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant) to help control and prevent bleeding associated with his hemophilia. “I needed a treatment what worked for me and fit into my personal routine,” explains Collier. “For me the XYNTHA Solofuse is easy to use and the travel-ready pack allows me to infuse my treatment where and when I need to.” 
 
Collier shares his story with the hemophilia community in an effort to encourage others to go after what they love. “Live the life you want to live and figure out how to do that within the parameters of your disease,” urges Collier. 
 
For Collier, this includes taking certain precautions when preparing for physical activity like a long run or cycling. 
 
Here are some tips for staying protected and active with hemophilia: 
 
* Take an honest assessment of your fitness level. While you may not be ready to go for a long distance run yet, you can still take small steps to reach your personal fitness goal And remember, before starting any exercise program, it is important to talk to your healthcare provider. 
 
* Be open with your treatment team about your personal need Discuss the best way to minimize any risk associated with the sport(s) you have chosen and what to do if an injury or bleed occurs. 
 
* Confirm with your physician the timing of your treatment in relation to your activity.[3]

About XYNTHA 
 
XYNTHA® Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant) is indicated in adults and children for the control and prevention of bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency or classic hemophilia) and for the prevention of bleeding during surgery in patients with hemophilia A. 
 
XYNTHA does not contain von Willebrand factor and, therefore, is not indicated for von Willebrand's disease. 
 
We asked patients to tell us about their experiences on XYNTHA. This is Collier’s story. 
 
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR XYNTHA 
 
* Call your healthcare provider or go to the emergency department right away if you have any of the following symptoms because these may be signs of a serious allergic reaction: wheezing, difficulty breathing, chest tightness, turning blue (look at lips and gums), fast heartbeat, swelling of the face, faintness, rash, low blood pressure, or hives. XYNTHA contains trace amounts of hamster protein. You may develop an allergic reaction to these proteins. Tell your healthcare provider if you have had an allergic reaction to hamster protein. 
 
* Call your healthcare provider right away if bleeding is not controlled after using XYNTHA; this may be a sign of an inhibitor, an antibody that may stop XYNTHA from working properly. Your healthcare provider may need to take blood tests to monitor for inhibitors. 
 
* Across all clinical studies, the most common side effects (10% or more) with XYNTHA in adult and pediatric previously treated patients (PTPs) were headache (26% of subjects), joint pain (25%), fever (21%), and cough (11%). Other side effects reported in 5% or more of patients were: diarrhea, vomiting, weakness, and nausea. 
 
* XYNTHA is an injectable medicine administered by intravenous (IV) infusio You may experience local irritation when infusing XYNTHA after reconstitution in XYNTHA® SOLOFUSE®. 
 
Please see full Prescribing Information for XYNTHA and XYNTHA SOLOFUSE. 
 
You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit  www.fda.gov/medwatch , or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

2467,"BATON ROUGE — LSU is seeking to end its deal with the private manager of its Shreveport and Monroe hospitals, two years after hospital operations were turned over to a research foundation as part of Gov. Bobby Jindal's effort to privatize the state's charity hospital system. The university system sent formal notice Thursday to the Biomedical Research Foundation of Northwest Louisiana, or BRF, that it considers the hospital manager in breach of its contract. It gave the foundation until Oct. 5 to withdraw as hospital operator. ""We have exhausted all avenues to resolve our differences amicably and now must take action that we hoped would not be necessary,"" LSU System President F. King Alexander said in a statement. In a July letter to the research foundation, Alexander said BRF had not established a sustainable financial model for the hospitals, had damaged the LSU Shreveport medical school's reputation and threatened the stability of both the medical school and the hospitals. Foundation leaders deny any mismanagement and say they have followed the contract's terms. They've said LSU has thwarted efforts to ease the transition and remedy concerns. The foundation didn't immediately respond Thursday to the breach of contract letter. It wasn't clear who would operate the hospitals if BRF agrees to remove its management. The university system said a group of ""civic leaders"" will help manage the hospital until LSU finds a new operator to replace the foundation, but didn't name any of the people involved. Alexander said the hospitals will continue normal operations during the transition. BRF took control of the two north Louisiana hospitals in October 2013 through a no-bid contract, part of Jindal's push to privatize most of the university-run public hospital system that cares for the uninsured and provides much of the state's medical student training. Privatization of the hospitals in Shreveport and Monroe was in contrast to the approach the Jindal administration took in south Louisiana, where LSU's facilities are being overseen by companies that run other private hospitals in the area. Created in 1986 to boost regional economic development, BRF had more limited resources and no background in hospital management. It had never previously run a patient care facility. Problems and disagreements developed between LSU and the research foundation nearly from the start. ""We want to secure operational and financial stability through a viable partnership, so we can continue to ensure both high quality health care and medical education,"" Alexander said Thursday.",f55d02ff-7db5-4413-a10e-007410cc6ed2,Blog,2015-09-24T18:27:16Z,Louisiana Politics & Government,"LSU seeking to oust operator of Shreveport, Monroe hospitals",1.0,News

2611,"Pandora, other webcasters and SoundExchange all got something they like in a determination that will guide how the Copyright Royalty Board judges in ""Webcasting IV"" -- the rate proceeding that will set webcasting royalty rates for the next five years -- should consider and weight evidence. The U.S. Register of Copyright, Maria Palante, writes in her 15-page memorandum that the judges who will determine the new rates may reference a direct licensing deal as a benchmark. That's a win for Pandora, which last year inked a licensing deal with independent rights organization Merlin, and other webcasters. ""We are pleased that the Copyright Office affirmed the admissibility of Pandora’s agreement with Merlin as a valid benchmark in the Copyright Royalty Board proceedings,"" said Dave Grimaldi, Pandora spokesman, in a statement. But Palante went further, telling the judges they may consider the existence and overall impact that the Webcaster Settlement Act of 2009, and the statutory license generally, might have on direct licensing agreements. That's a possible win for SoundExchange, which had argued the Merlin deal is inadmissible because the WSA 2009 says that current statutory rates and terms for ""pureplay"" webcasters are inadmissible. (Pureplay webcasters do not simulcast their terrestrial radio broadcasts on the Web.) In Webcasting IV, SoundExchange has proposed rates that would start at 0.25 cents in 2016 and rise 0.01 cents each year, to 0.29 cents in 2020. Pandora has, of course, proposed much lower rates, starting at 0.11 cents for ad-supported streams (increasing 0.02 cents per year) and 0.215 cents for subscription streams (increasing 0.03 cents in the second year and 0.04 cents the following three years). Since these rates are more in line with what non-pureplay webcasters are paying, the fact that the CRB can, with this ruling, consider how these rates have impacted other webcasters may be a plus for SoundExchange. It may seem strange that future statutory rates can't take into account current statutory rates and terms. The explanation starts with the royalty rates set by the Copyright Royalty Board judges in 2007 for the years 2006 to 2010. After much outcry from the Internet radio services and their listeners -- Pandora mounted a grassroots campaign that generated widespread attention -- Congress gave both sides additional time to negotiate more favorable rates. Rather than operate under rates that would have critically wounded a burgeoning digital service category, the marketplace worked out a solution -- the WSA 2009, a bill that allowed pureplay webcasters like Pandora to negotiate rates lower than those set by the judges in 2007. While webcasters were spared the tougher rates, the Act wasn't supposed to set a precedent. The WSA 2009 says Copyright Royalty Board judges cannot take into account its provisions when setting statutory royalty rates in the future. Instead, Congress explicitly stated the Act should be seen as ""a compromise"" motivated by the parties' unique situation.  Webcasters aren't required to use the statutory license and its corresponding royalty rates (currently 0.14 cents per stream for a pureplay webcaster). So last year, Pandora signed a licensing deal with Merlin that pays Merlin labels and artists a discounted royalty rate for incremental streams beyond what would normally be played. To Pandora, the Merlin deal is just the sort of market-based licensing agreement that CRB judges' determination is suppose to mimic. (Since there is no market for a statutory license, the CRB tries to figure out what the rates would be if the parties were to negotiate on an open market.) To SoundExchange, the Merlin deal is inadmissible because it is influenced by the WSA 2009. So the Copyright Royalty Board judges asked the Register of Copyrights if they may consider some or all of a direct licensing deal that copies or was influenced by the WSA 2009. It was a fight over the admissibility of evidence, with fairly grand consequences. Evidence that pushes the statutory rates down or up a fraction of a cent will swing the annual royalties paid to artists and labels -- or saved by webcasters -- by many tens of millions of dollars each year. Creators are relying on growing segments like Internet radio to build a bridge to their digital futures. Internet radio services want rates fair enough to allow their segment of the marketplace to grow. Both sides got a win Monday, but the ultimate question is who wins when rates are announced in December?",4bc5fe21-b0ff-45cc-b224-ff47b23daf58,Blog,2015-09-22T15:31:17Z,Billboard.com Music News,Pandora and SoundExchange Each Get Small Wins in Rate Proceeding,1.0,News

1791,"Some of the wisest words on financial planning this year come from a poker champion named Annie Duke . 
What, a gambler has anything worthwhile to tell investors? Isn’t that like Hannibal Lecter giving you tips on personal safety? Actually, her insights into human foibles, which she exploits to great success at the gaming table, are very helpful for managing your investments. 
Duke, who has won top honors at the World Series of Poker, gave a bravura presentation a few months ago to the Investment Management Consultants Assoc., or IMCA , in (where else?) Las Vegas. As Financial Planning magazine’s Scott Wenger wrote, channeling the famed Kenny Rogers song, “The Gambler ,” Duke shared her thoughts with financial advisors on “how to know when to hold ’em, know when to fold ’em, and how to advise clients who may want to walk away or run.” 
When she was younger, Duke pursued a Ph.D in cognitive psychology at Columbia University. She shucked the ivy-walled academic life for the world of felt-topped tables and cards, but used her knowledge of human behavior to great effect in the casino. As the Gambler tells Kenny Rogers: “I’ve made a life/Out of readin’ people’s faces/Knowin’ what the cards were/By the way they held their eyes.” 
At first blush, financial planning seems far afield from poker. But that isn’t so. Both involve human psychology and guarding against bad luck. 
If you had a soundly diversified portfolio during the 2007-09 financial crisis, when the Standard & Poor’s 500 slid almost 56%, your fall would have been far less severe. And if you sold all your stock in March 2009, which turned out to be the trough of the bear market, you missed an enormous run-up that obliterated your losses. 
Back in the Cold War, Pentagon strategists sought to find a game to model how to anticipate and counter Soviet actions, Duke told IMCA conferees. At first, the war planners favored chess due to its intricate moves. But then they settled on poker, owing to its dependence on psychology and its need for sussing out a host of unknowns. “Poker is a game of decision making under conditions of uncertainty over time,” she said. 
Duke ticked off numerous mistakes that investors make. One is to keep at a course of action because they already have committed a lot of money to it, even though the evidence suggests the odds of future success are low. Perhaps you’ve centered your investments on gold , despite its epic fall – almost 40% over the past four years. Absent an economic collapse or rabid inflation, a turnaround in the yellow metal is unlikely anytime soon. Too bad if you want to pay Junior’s tuition bill with your gold-trading profits. With gold, you should’ve folded ‘em. 
Another common failing, Duke said, is failure to invest for the future – because seeing yourself years from now is difficult. “We actually don’t know our future selves,” she said. Since that person is a stranger, you direct all your financial decisions to meeting today’s wants and needs, tending to the person you know well: you, circa 2015. The retirement account gets short shrift. A good poker player thinks several hands ahead. 
She noted that advisors strive to teach clients how to learn from such past mistakes. Advisors, she said, combat investors’ self-delusion. “If you credit all wins to your skill and all losses to bad luck, you never learn and never improve.” 
The Gambler described his secret as “knowin’ what to throw away, and knowin’ what to keep.” 
He and Annie Duke have much to teach us.

California’s new Common Core-aligned test scores were released this month. They weren’t good. 

Overall, 44 percent of California students met the test’s English language arts standard and 33 percent met the math standard. San Bernardino County was below average, with 37 percent meeting the English standard and 25 percent for math. Bear Valley Unified School District was low for the county, with 35 percent and 23 percent meeting English and math standards, respectively. 

Third through eighth-graders and 11th-graders took the tests, called the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress. Eleventh-graders scored lower than the district average on English and math. The test was designed for students who took Common Core curriculum all through school, even though the new standards have only been implemented in the last few years. 

Low scores were “not unexpected,” said Lisa Waner, executive director of educational services for the Bear Valley school district. Although the State Board of Education voted to adopt the Common Core State Standards in 2010, individual districts were given flexibility, and Bear Valley started later than some others. Waner said this could be one factor in explaining the low scores. 

Waner also pointed to the district’s high percentages of English learners and students from low-income families as potential causes. She said the district is working to improve scores this year. 

Bear Valley Unified is looking into buying new Common Core-aligned math textbooks. Since Common Core was introduced, according to Waner, older textbooks have often been simply re-branded as compliant with the new standards when they really fell short of that goal, but that trend is shifting. 

The district hasn’t ordered new books yet. Waner said publishers will provide sample problems that teachers can review to see how it might work for their classes. “Teachers will make the ultimate decision because they’re the ones on the ground using the material,” Waner said. Most textbooks have an online component, Waner said. Whether to use physical books, e-books or both hasn’t been decided. 

The district will also implement quarterly benchmarks, Waner said, which it used to do but which have been less prevalent in recent years. Last year students could take a practice test to learn to navigate the computer-based test, and teachers were encouraged to administer it. This year, practice tests will be mandatory and more closely reflect actual test questions. 

“We’re still sending teachers to different trainings,” Waner said. “We’re looking at bringing up a math coach to help with different strategies, different ways of teaching that match the Common Core philosophy a little bit better.” 
  
The performance metric that impacts districts most directly is the federal Adequate Yearly Progress measure. If districts don’t meet AYP requirements they may come under closer oversight. While funding may increase, it’s more strictly controlled. AYP usually measures four categories: attendance, graduation rate, test participation rate and test scores. 

Last spring’s scores on California’s new tests won’t be taken into account for this year’s evaluation. “They’re not taking that as an accountability measure because they’re just setting the first baseline for it,” Waner said. All the numbers aren’t in yet, but Waner believes Bear Valley Unified will meet all the other AYP requirements. The AYP will likely take scores on the new tests into account in the future, but it’s unclear how soon. 

“Every meeting I go to at the county, the state is still figuring this out and changing things all the time,” Waner said.

TO GEAR up for their first Oxjam Takeover, the Pied Busker of Teignmouth was drumming up support this weekend. 

The Pied Busker of Teignmouth, with a few other local musicians, walked the streets of Teignmouth entertaining shoppers for charity on Saturday. 

The procession started outside the Oxfam shop and then walked to significant places to stop and busk ahead of the main Teignmouth Takeover event next month. 

The group continued to Finley Browns Cafe where they had equipment set up to continue the music and do an intimate gig. 
 
Lee Hall, from band Datura, performed a solo set, as well as Tom Hayes and Robert Johnson, from band Alpha Tide. 

There were bucket shakers outside the door to attract more of an audience and let them know what was going on. 

Oxjam organiser Georgie Hellier said: ""Our fundraiser, the Pied Busker of Teignmouth, went amazingly well. 

""Our musicians were so talented and the busker had a great cheeky personality to really embrace the slightly unconventional event, get fully involved and attract the public's attention. 

""All the members of the public who we saw were genuinely intrigued with what we were doing, and so generous when they knew what we were raising money for. We are really happy with the amount we raised for Oxfam. 

""Finley Browns Cafe was the perfect little venue to host the second part of our fundraising event. The owners, Martin and Faye, were so accommodating and really keen to get involved and help Oxjam Teignmouth."" 

The Oxjam Teignmouth Takeover will take place on October 16 at Teignmouth Rugby Club from 7pm. 

Tickets are available from www.wegottickets.com, Teignmouth Oxfam Shop, Teignmouth Rugby Club, Teignmouth Tourist Information Centre and Finley Browns.",ab6da993-9c0b-4075-9f71-dba1304691a4,News,2015-09-25T09:36:07Z,Torquay Herald Express,Pied Busker of Teignmouth leads town to charity festival,0.0,Blog

This means that in order for a panel to receive as much sunlight as possible, it has to pan with the sun as it moves across the sky.

Some unusual homes are on the market and making headlines. counterclockwise: The Rock House, the Volcano House, the Flintstone House and Palazzo di AmoreCOMPOSITE BY MARILYN KALFUS; PHOTOS: JEFF GRITCHEN, LEONARD ORTIZ, MICHAEL McNAMARA, OPEN HOMES PHOTOGRAPHY 

When Brian Grey had to figure out the value of a landmark home known as the Flintstone House, the appraiser couldn’t look to comparable residences. With its clump of bubble-shaped rooms, the home seemed to spring out of a Hanna-Barbera cartoon. 

Grey quickly realized, “I just don’t have another house that’s like this. 

” 

That didn’t make the property a white elephant, though. 

When Grey asked several real estate agents in the Bay Area whether there was a market for the unusual home, he recalled, “The consensus was there’s constant demand. 

” 

Sure enough, a buyer snapped it up for $800,000. 

Nearly two decades later, the quirky marvel – remodeled and enhanced – is on the market again, this time for $4.2 million. 

It’s one of several out-of-the-ordinary dwellings that have been making headlines lately. 

In the Mojave Desert, a house shaped like a spaceship and set on the 150-foot cinder cone of an extinct volcano was listed at $650,000 earlier this month and went into escrow Friday. The property, on 60 acres with a lake, got multiple offers. In Beverly Hills, a sprawling compound touted as the priciest home in the U.S. last year just took a $46 million price cut. 

Despite their differences, houses like these raise a common question: How does anyone – real estate professionals, sellers or buyers – figure out what off-the-wall, over-the-top homes are worth? 

The Volcano House was owned by TV personality Huell Howser, who gave it to Chapman University in 2012, a year before his death. The university had originally planned to use the house for desert studies, astronomy and geology pursuits. But it’s selling the property because its desert location, in Newberry Springs east of Barstow, was deemed too isolated for students. 

Brady Sandahl of Hom Sotheby’s International Realty says he and another agent listing the house considered other “architecturally significant” properties, mostly in the high desert, in coming up with the $650,000 price tag. 

“You just develop a business gut as to what you think the market will capture,” he said. “Then you turn to the buyers, and they’ll tell you why they’re giving you what they’re giving you. That’s the beauty of an open market. 

” 

Sandahl said the multiple offers he received show the asking price was appropriate; three offers came in at $650,000 or more. 

But clearly, the price tag would be higher if the property wasn’t so remote. 

“This is real estate,” said Grey, who appraised the Flintstone House. “The first three rules of real estate are location, location, location. 

” 

The Flintstone House is on the opposite side of that rule. It’s 17 miles from San Francisco and right near I-280, a major freeway. 

“When you’re in the yard of the Flintstone House,” Grey said, “you hear that freeway very clearly. 

” 

While the noise outside the home is a minus, on the plus side, Grey said, the house itself is nearly soundproof: “It’s like being in a cave. 

” 

He attributes that to the construction. Steel rebar and wire mesh frames were built over large inflated weather balloons then covered with gunite, or “shotcrete.” He said that makes the walls thicker than a typical home’s. 

Appraising even unusual homes involves the basics, Grey said. Size, number of rooms, quality of finishes and condition are all factors considered in addition to location. 

“Those are relevant to any house, no matter how unusual or historical or plain it is,” he said. 

THE COMPS 

With no truly comparable homes, Grey said, he used a bracketing system to determine where the Flintstone House fit on a spectrum. He placed the area’s high-end Tudor homes and plain ranch homes at opposite ends. 

“Appraising something … it’s quite a bit more art than science,” he said. “In terms of appraising that house, I put it right in the middle. 

” 

He did not make comparisons with unusual homes elsewhere in the country, he said. 

With land value varying greatly, he explained, “You could be avoiding an adjustment regarding the design of the house and making a huge adjustment for the difference in location. 

” 

In Southern California, Realtors Joyce Rey and Stacy Gottula of Coldwell Banker Previews International cast a considerably wider net to come up with Palazzo di Amore’s $195 million price tag, which has since dropped to $149 million. 

The agents said they looked to the most expensive homes worldwide. 

The 25-acre compound with its own vineyard in Beverly Hills was touted as the most expensive in the U.S. when it came on the market last year. 

The gated, 12-bedroom, 23-bathroom property was eight years in the making. It’s reached by a quarter-mile, tree-lined drive and has a guard station. A two-level entertainment center, with a 50-seat screening room and a bowling alley, is entered through a floating glass-floor walkway over pools lined by 70-year-old olive trees. 

The main residence tops 35,000 square feet, while the entire estate has more than 53,000 square feet of living space. There’s garage parking for 27 cars, though the site “can easily accommodate parking for (approximately) 150 cars,” according to the listing. 

“There are so few comps, you really have to look at the history of sales in the area as well as the global sales,” Gottula said. 

“They’re going to be a global citizen of some kind,” Rey said of the likely buyers. “They’re going to have houses in various places, and they’re going to be looking, in all probability, in all of those markets. 

” 

The Realtors considered the highest sales in London, Hong Kong, France and elsewhere. They …",3c8cc0df-fb5c-433f-b30b-0577e8b29b83,News,2015-09-20T04:43:02Z,MyInforms,"The Volcano House, Palazzo di Amore, the Flintstone House: What's the real worth of an over-the-top home?",0.0,News

Ultramarines vs Tau Empire.
The Tau Empire, ever determined to recapture their lost territory have returned to T'Lau. Tha Tau were successful in inflicting severe casualties upon the defenders which allowed them to capture a number of strategic locations and give themselves a safe landing site far from enemy artillery. The attack lasted for over a month with the Astra Militarum being constantly on the backfoot. Already weakened and exhausted from recent attacks on the planet they were ill equipped to handle such a large scale invasion.
Then suddenly and expected, a storm of drop pods descended from the skies into the heart of the Tau command. Battle brothers from the Ultramarines chapter emerged and engaged the Tau. Elsewhere they deployed via thunderhawk transports to the outer defences of the Imperial defenders. While the veterans sought to slay the alien leadership, these new arrivals launched attacks into the outer lines. Confusion and panic spread throughout the Tau military and they retreated back towards their command. The Ultramarines pursued, never giving the xenos the chance to regroup or resupply. When the Tau commander fell, slain in single combat with the Ultramarines captain, the Tau lines collapsed. The Astra Militarum then moved in to mop up the stragglers and routed fire warriors. It took the Ultramarines several more swift strikes to finish off the last Tau present on T'Lau but their attempted invasion failed but they would return.",4985482e-8592-455e-8ede-a36dad43aaac,Blog,2015-09-07T19:08:59Z,40K Midas Crusade,The Tau Strike Back - T'Lau,1.0,Blog

2217,"More demand Europe ready-to-eat and fibreless mango Worldwide, the production of mangoes seems to be unable to keep up with demand. More markets are opening up for the tropical fruit, which is expected to push up prices. In addition, the market is rather changeable because of the short seasons for each origin. In Europe, there's a clear preference for the fibreless varieties, with the Keitt and Kent doing particularly well. On the other side of the world, in China, there's a preference for varieties like Big Tai Mango, Small Tai Mango and Aiwen. Both in the United States and in Europe, good prices are achieved. Supplies from Spain are significantly lower this year, due to an 'off year'. Israel profits from this gap, but volumes aren't very big. Peru is expecting better volumes starting in December, but El Niño could still disrupt the harvest.

Israel has good market in EuropeThe mango season is in full swing, and lasts until mid-October. Different varieties, such as Shelly, Omer, Kent en Keitt, provide European importers with many opportunities for ripening. This year, the volume turns out roughly 40% lower. The season is traditionally difficult from late July until mid-August. When the Keitt and Kent become available on August 20, the market will bounce back.

For the coming months, Israel expects a good market in Europe, caused by smaller volumes and growing demand. Israel has a smaller harvest due to the winter weather, and Spain is expecting lower volumes, providing Israeli exporters with opportunities. The export volume will increase, by the way, since more growers are offering the products for export. They're also looking at new markets, including the United Kingdom, Russia, South Africa, Canada and East Asia. The country has an acreage of 1600 hectares, with the most important production regions in the Jordan Rift Valley.

Belgium: more demand ready-to-eat and fibreless mangoOne Belgian importer, accounting for about 6500 tonnes of mangoes each year, says that the market is going more and more toward ready-to-eat. The amount of produce sold unripened decreases every year in favour of ripened mangoes. The importer focuses on fibreless mangoes. A challenge which makes the importer consciously ignore the Tommy Atkins from Brazil, which have good availability year-round, but too much fibre in the flesh. The Kent and Keitt make up the top of the mango market. Some years ago, the importer tried importing yellow mangoes from India and Pakistan. Although the fruit can be counted among the top of the market, there was no market for it in Belgium.

Spanish volume decreases by 50%After an exceptionally good year, called an 'on year' in the sector, Spain expects an off year this season, with a decrease in volume by 50%. Last year, the volume surpassed 24,000 tonnes. For the Osteen variety, with a 90% market share in the Spanish acreage, a 50% decrease is expected. For Keitt and Kent, a 15% increase is reckoned with. Growers are expecting high prices again this year. Last year, prices were good already, with 2 euros per kilo for the grower. ""This year, we're expecting comparable or even higher prices,"" a Spanish trader says. And while last year the season began with prices between 6 and 14 euros per box, another trader reckons with prices over 10 euros. The Spanish mango is conquering the European market, with prices comparable to those of flown mangoes.

French market limited during summerDuring the summer months, there's a limited market for mangoes. Competition with summer fruit is fierce. With that season ending, the market for mangoes is expected to bounce back in the coming weeks. Toward the end of September, the market reaches a peak. One trader says that the biggest part of the import, 60%, goes to the French market, the remaining volumes are shipped to other European countries. The main countries of origin are Brazil, Peru, Senegal, South Africa and Ivory Coast. ""For both Europe and France, the Keitt and Kent are favourites,"" the importer says. This month, the import flow shifts from Senegal, accounting for 800 of the importer's tonnes, to Brazil, where the importer hopes to import 1200 tonnes.

Germany: Tommy Atkins losing groundIn the past three years, demand for ripened, fibreless mangoes has increased sharply in Germany as well. The Tommy Atkins are losing ground in this market to the Kent, Keitt and Palmer. Main suppliers are currently Puerto Rico and Brazil. The Senegalese season is nearly over, and soon the start of the season is expected from Israel and Spain. The German consumer prefers the sizes 7, 8 and 9, which are abundantly available. Demand is highest between October and June.

Latin AmericaBrazil and Peru are the main export countries for the Kent and Keitt varieties. Brazil enters the market with these varieties between October and January, while the Palmer is available virtually year-round. Peru is strong between January and March, mainly with Kent.

Guatemala: first mangoes to Spain and GermanyIn Latin American Guatemala, eight companies are currently exporting mangoes. 2.9% of the production goes to the American market, about 10% is destined for the European market. This year, the first mangoes were flown to Germany and Spain. The export to these countries is expected to increase next year. At government level, the government is working on opening up the Chilean market. ""We think there's an opportunity, because the season doesn't overlap with Peru, Ecuador and Brazil, countries that can export to Chile. Our season runs from March until May,"" an exporter says. All in all, the acreage numbers roughly 6000 hectares. 5,000 of those hectares are planted with Tommy Atkins. The other hectares are divided up among Ataulfo (500 ha), Kent (300 ha) and Keitt (200).

Peru: better season expectedThe mango cultivation is an important employer for many Peruvians. The cultivation covers about 27,000 hectares across 14,000 growers. Especially in the regions of Piura, Lambayeque and Ancash, many of the inhabitants depend on the cultivation of mangoes. The 2013-2014 season (December to March) had a good harvest, this year the harvest will turn out lower. The export in the 2014-2015 season amounted to 130,000 tonnes, 104,000 (80%) of which fresh, and 18,000 tonnes (14%) frozen. The remaining tonnes were processed in juices or dried. For the upcoming season, a good production is expected, although El Niño can still impact the production. At the end of October, more will be known about the expected volumes.

Main markets are the Netherlands, accounting for 37.08%, followed by the United States (34.02%) and England (11.94%). The biggest competitor at the start of the season is Ecuador, although one Peruvian exporter believes the countries also complement each other. For the European market, Brazil is the biggest competitor, particularly because African countries haven't gained a foothold yet, the exporter says.

United States: good prices for small sizesOn the West Coast, demand for small sizes is particularly high. Not good for trade, because most traders have large calibres of Keitts available. These mangoes are imported from Mexico. Brazilian mangoes are finding their way to the East Coast, where demand is higher. Reason is the low supplies, with the Mexican season nearing its end and Brazil not having spikes in volume yet. When supplies from Ecuador, generally at the end of October, get going later than usual, the prices will still remain high for a while. On average, a box of mangoes from Brazil yields between 9 and 10 dollars.

Chinese demand peaks around Spring FestivalTaiwan and Thailand are the biggest suppliers of mangoes to China. These countries export the highest volume, especially of the Aiwen and Golden varieties. The import season generally runs from June until August. For the top segment, however, the Chinese importers are looking to Australia. The peak of the Australian import is in February, coinciding with the Chinese Spring Festival, pushing up prices.

In addition to import, the country also has its own cultivation. After India, China is the biggest producer of mangoes in the world. Major cultivation regions are Guangxi and Hainan. The season in Hainan starts in April, with the mangoes of the Big Tai Mango and Small Tai Mango varieties competing with the import from Australia and Taiwan for quality, but they are cheaper. In Guangxi, the most produced variety is the Guiqi mango.

The mango is a popular fruit in China, and domestic cultivation is on the rise, with regions like Huaping, in the province of Yunnan, having invested in cultivation. At the moment, about 6500 small growers are planting. In 2020, the region wants to have increased the acreage to 20,000 hectares, with a yield of 300,000 tonnes. The mangoes from the region are less popular than the fruit from Hainan and Guangxi, however.

Australia exports to ChinaSince 2004, Australia has had access to the Chinese market. China mostly imports the top segment from the country. The most popular variety for export to China is the Bowen.

The biggest news is just that there will be a split crop for the Northern Territory - additional flowering will mean trees get picked twice. Exports still expected to increase to 20%, and harvest to kick off by mid November. Every week, FreshPlaza publishes an overview of the market situation of a product in a worldwide context.

723,"By | IANS India Private Limited/Yahoo India News  –  
New Delhi, Sep 5 (IANS) Putting an end to months of speculation, the government on Saturday announced it will be implementing 'One Rank One Pension' (OROP) for the armed forces, even as the veterans said they were not fully satisfied with the scheme. 
 
Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar made the announcement at a press conference flanked by Minister of State for Defence Rao Inderjit Singh, Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha, Army chief General Dalbir Singh, Navy chief Admiral R.K. Dhowan and Defence Secretary G. Mohan Kumar. 
 
Parrikar said an order implementing the scheme was likely to come in a fortnight to a month. 
 
The minister squarely blamed the previous Congress-led government for miscalculations on OROP, and said it led to the delay in its implementation. 
 
He also quoted a reply by a former minister of state for defence in parliament in 2009, who had said ""there are administrative, technical and financial difficulties in implementing OROP"". 
 
""It is for these reasons that the present government took some time to fulfill its promise,"" he said. 
 
The estimated cost to the exchequer for the scheme will be Rs.8,000-10,000 crore, and the arrears will amount to around Rs.12,000 crore. 
 
The scheme announced by the government will take 2013 as the base year to calculate pensions. 
 
""Pensions will be re-fixed for all pensioners retiring in the same rank and with same length of service as the average of minimum and maximum pension in 2013,"" Parrikar said. 
 
Those drawing pension above the average will be protected. 
 
Parrikar said the government came to power on May 26, 2014 and the budget came in June, so the date of implementation will be immediately after that, which was July 1, 2014. 
 
The period for review is five years, something that has been a major sticking point. 
 
Another major issue is that the government's scheme is not for those who seek voluntary retirement, even though Parrikar said that those who are forced to take retirement due to injuries obtained during service will be protected. 
 
The arrears are to be paid in four instalments, at a gap of every six months. 
 
To war widows, the arrears will be given in one instalment. 
 
Rao Inderjit said veterans above 60 years of age will also get arrears in one go. 
 
Announcing the scheme, Parrikar said the government was dedicated to the scheme which has been pending for ""40 years"". 
 
""The issue of OROP has been pending for nearly four decades. It is a matter of deep anguish that various governments remained ambivalent on the issue of OROP,"" said Parrikar. 
 
Protesting ex-servicemen on Saturday said they were not ""fully satisfied"" with the OROP scheme announced by the government as all of their demands were not met. 
 
""Though we welcome the implementation of the OROP by the government, we are not fully satisfied as they have not accepted the six points demanded by the ex-servicemen,"" Maj. Gen. Satbir Singh (retd), who has been spearheading the campaign for OROP, told the media at Jantar Mantar shortly after Parrikar's announcement. 
 
He said a decision on the future course of their agitation would be taken later in the evening. 
 
In the government press conference, Parrikar blamed the previous Congress-led government, saying they promised implementation of OROP in 2014-15, but ""did not specify what OROP would be, how it will be implemented or how much it will cost"". 
 
""An estimated Rs.500 crore provided for OROP in the budget presented in February 2014 by the then government was not based on any calculation,"" he said. 
 
""The reality, however, is that to implement OROP the estimated cost to the exchequer would be Rs.8,000 to Rs.10,000 crore at present, and will increase further in future,"" he said.",cc7a4d57-e161-4c53-915c-1bd29a5a1e71,News,2015-09-05T13:16:17Z,Yahoo!

1480,"Bacanora Minerals has issued an update on the drilling programme currently being undertaken as part of the pre-feasibility study at its Sonora lithium project in Mexico. 
Bacanora has now completed nine holes (totaling 1,850 metres) of the currently planned 18 hole drilling programme (approximately 4,000 metres). 

As a result of the company's recent agreement with Tesla Motors, a second rig has been mobilised to site to increase the speed of drilling, with the intention to complete the remaining holes in September. 

Analyses received from the first four holes from the Fleur concession indicate that weighted averages for lithium content in the Upper Clay is 1,862 ppm Li over 24.15 metres in thickness and the Lower Clay averages 4,871 ppm Li over 24.15 metres. 

The programme is primarily focused on significantly increasing the Indicated Mineral Resources within the Sonora lithium project, as well as testing whether the high grades and near surface mineralisation identified at the La Ventana concession continue into the northern area of the Fleur concession, which immediately adjoins La Ventana to the south.  The Company's resource was recently updated by SRK Consulting (UK) Limited to: 

·     Indicated resources of 1.14 million tonnes (""Mt"") lithium carbonate equivalent (""LCE"") contained in 95Mt of clay, at lithium (""Li"") grade of 2,200 ppm 

·     Inferred resources of 6.3Mt LCE contained in 500 Mt of clay at a Li grade of 2,300 ppm 

For further details, investors are encouraged to reference the Company's press releases dated 14 May and 27 June 2015 and/or the SRK's report that was filed on May 13, 2015 and is accessible on the Company's website. 

The Sonora lithium project is comprised of the following lithium properties: La Ventana lithium concession, which is 100 percent owned by Bacanora; El Sauz and Fleur concessions, which are held by Mexilit SA de CV; and the Megalit concession, which is held by Megalit SA de CV. Mexilit and Megalit are owned 70% by Bacanora and 30%  by Rare Earth Minerals, plc.   Upon completion of the drill programme and assaying, SRK will deliver an updated resource model for mine design purposes, with an initial focus on the higher grade, open pit resources on the La Ventana and Fleur concessions. 

Chief executive Peter Secker said: ""Drilling is progressing very positively and with a second rig about to arrive on site, we expect to complete this programme rapidly.  This campaign will form a critical component of our pre-feasibility study and it is our hope and expectation that, upon completion of drilling, we will have sufficient data to update and upgrade our resources to advance the mine design.""

5386,"The Chimney is done and the self-made Chimney Cap is in place!  It took me less time than I had thought, but more work than I had thought.  A little background for our new readers:  Over a year ago, I had to attack my living room and tear out a section about 12 x 12 feet.  I worked most of the summer tearing out and then replacing joists, floor and walls. It was long hard work and my wife and I did it alone. The stress landed me in the hospital exactly 1 year ago this last weekend, which caused me to have to put a hold on these final parts of the project. Most importantly, was the chimney to my fireplace.
You'd think I would have got to that this summer, but if you'll read last week's post you'll see references to rain, and slippery roofs and reasons to put off the chimney install to the right weekend. Ok, so now we're caught up and you, like me, can marvel at the wonder the concept: This last weekend, the chimney was installed!  (Yes, I'm going to say that a few more times, I'm very proud of my accomplishment, so bear with me.) I thought I'd share my efforts in preparation for the install.  Y'see, I needed a part to finish the chimney (look up there, ain't it keen?) and couldn't seem to find one anywhere. The part I needed was the ring that held the chimney pieces together.  (You can see it as it originally was installed here.) I had spent the day in the hardware store looking at 're-workable' stovepipe parts and found this:  This is  a piece of stove pipe made for standard wood burning stoves which I knew I could use.  You see those three ends each has a separate collar held on with just a couple of rivets. It's a simple job for me to cut those rivets off and refashion the collars for my own use in assembly of a triple wall chimney (yeah, no one carries them anymore and the company has changed owners, so there's no way to find one, let alone replace it. Gotta re-manufacture it - a Southern Tradition in itself.) One collar for the inner chimney, one for the center chimney and the third to help the other two fit properly. Like this:    Inner Chimney w/collarCenter Wall w/collar And then of course the outer wall.   There is still a lot to do on this project, but for the moment I'm going to be insufferable.  I've been walking around work showing off my pictures of the chimney like a new father showing off his offspring.  (I'd hand out cigars if they weren't so expensive!) In truth, I feel I may have garnered more points to become a true Good Ol' Boy, a card carrying member of the True South. I showed off my ability to think through a problem, refashion something for my own use and I got a chance to fix things up right!  But more than that, I got to use an angle grinder to cut metal and throw a large plume of sparks out across the roof of my house. Very satisfying.   The next day I took this pic of the storm collar and chimney cap combination with the rising sun shining off them.  I can hardly wait for the next rain storm!  ",74e5bc2d-6324-4332-a980-6770a27d5927,Blog,2015-09-17T11:00:00Z,Southern Life at The Marvinator's Place,All Hail THE CHIMNEYMASTER!,1.0,Blog

2777,"South African business incubator Raizcorp in partnership with major local bank Nedbank will be hosting the SimplyBiz Shift Questions workshop in Cape Town 12 September. The workshop is part of a national effort to equip entrepreneurs with the tools needed to think differently about their businesses and accelerate success. 
     
CEO of Raizcorp, who will also be facilitating the one-day session, explains that the SimplyBiz Shift Questions workshop will teach entrepreneurs to shift the paradigms of their thinking. 
 
“Many people have this notion that if they follow the exact steps that a successful entrepreneur took in their own journey, they too will become successful,” says Raiz. “As a young man, I asked my mentor what the secret was to becoming wealthy. Surely if it were as simple as reading a book on 10 steps to success everyone would be rich?”

1243,"NORCROSS — The Meadowcreek Mustangs opened their home schedule in style with a 43-18 win on Friday over Rockdale, giving head coach Jason Carrera a victory in his home debut, even though the teams had to wait a little longer than expected to get started. 
 
The initial kickoff at Meadowcreek was delayed by one hour because of lightning in the area, but the Mustang offense quickly began a productive night that gave them a lead of at least eight points for the bulk of the final three quarters. 
 
“It feels great,” said Carrera, who earned his first win in his second game as the Mustangs’ head coach. “I want this to be the norm here. The kids deserve it.” 
 
Rockdale (1-2) scored on its opening drive to take a 6-0 lead with 10 minutes, 13 seconds left in the first quarter, but Meadowcreek (1-1) answered with a score of its own fewer than six minutes later when Mustangs quarterback Darion Hammons, in his third game at the position, capped a nine-play drive with a quarterback sneak from the 1-yard line. 
 
Kicker Michael Mendez converted the extra point to give Meadowcreek a 7-6 lead, and the Mustangs did not trail the rest of the way. 
 
Two TD passes and another rushing score in the second quarter by Hammons gave them a 28-12 lead by halftime. 
 
Rockdale closed to within 10 points of Meadowcreek’s lead midway through the third quarter when Tajee Steele scored on a 1-yard rush. However, the Mustangs held Rockdale scoreless on 50 yards of offense in its final four drives to preserve the victory. 
 
Hammons led the way for the Meadcreek offense with three rushing and passing TDs each. He was 13-for-17 passing with 153 yards, and he rushed for 153 yards on 20 attempts, leading all players in each category. 
 
Two of Hammons’ TD passes went to wide receiver Shadiah Toppin, who caught three passes total for 56 yards. Terrence Newborn Jr. caught the other pass, a 22-yard score with 10 seconds left before halftime that gave Meadowcreek a 28-12 lead as the teams entered their respective locker rooms. Newborn finished with three catches for 67 yards. 
 
The Mustangs defense held Rockdale to 146 yards of total offense, and Bulldogs quarterback Datrevis Shorter went 10-for-25 passing with 111 yards and a TD pass. Rockdale defender Jermaine McSween recovered a fumble when Hammons tried to throw a lateral pass, and he scored with 3:52 left in the second quarter that briefly narrowed the score to 20-12.

171,"The Canberra Capitals are poised to re-sign reigning WNBL player of the year Abby Bishop in a massive boost to the club's hopes of ending a four-year finals drought. The Canberra Capitals are poised to re-sign reigning WNBL player of the year Abby Bishop in a massive boost to the club's hopes of ending a four-year finals drought. Bishop has been granted a release from her contract with Hungarian club UNIQA Sopron, and the Capitals are deep in discussions with their incumbent captain.

The 26-year-old picked up a minor hamstring injury playing for Seattle Storm and was due to head to Hungary next week, but Bishop and Sopron have come to a mutual agreement.

It is understood the Capitals hope to make an official announcement as early as this week.

Bishop dominated the WNBL last year, averaging 23 points and 10.6 rebounds, and was a clear winner of the player of the year.

The Capitals are very confident Bishop's injury isn't a risk and she will get through the full season.

Just a few weeks ago the Capitals' roster was severely depleted, but they now look very much a finals contender after recruiting shrewdly since.

Bishop's recruitment helps ease the Capitals' concerns in the post, as they had been struggling to find a quality replacement after Belgian centre Ann Wauters withdrew late due to family reasons.

Star centre Lauren Jackson, herself returning from knee surgery, is the only specialist post player Canberra currently has on its books.

But if both stay fit, Jackson and Bishop will from arguably the most imposing front court partnership in the WNBL.

Jackson's rehabilitation is progressing well and she plans to be back on court early in the season.

Opals point guard Kathleen MacLeod also pulled out after falling pregnant, but the Capitals compensated by signing former WNBA All-Star Renee Montgomery last week.

Montgomery's Minnesota Lynx has qualified for the WNBA Finals after disposing of Phoenix in the western conference finals.

It means Montgomery will miss at least the season-opener against Dandenong at AIS Arena on October 10, and the week two games at Sydney and Townsville should the WNBA Finals go the full five games.

A lack of personnel, particularly in the front court, has forced the Capitals to cancel its pre-season game in Sydney on Saturday.

With Jackson, Bishop and Montgomery still absent, just seven contracted players suited up in three games against South-East Queensland last weekend.

Hanna Zavecz injured her ribs at training last week and Opals youngster Steph Talbot hit her head on the court against the Stars.

The Capitals aren't willing to risk the pair this week before the start of the WNBL season, but both will be fit to play.

Meanwhile, the Capitals are yet to finalise a deal which would see the majority of their home games shifted from AIS Arena to the Royal Theatre.

However, it is understood the club is confident an agreement will be reached before season tip-off.

It is hoped the move into the city to a smaller venue will ensure bigger crowds and a better atmosphere as the Capitals shoot for a first finals appearance since 2010-11.

3430,"Mark Trickey, second from the left, with sons Shane, Boe and Simon.  Source: Supplied  
        
 GEOFF Balderas choked back tears when he reflected on the life of the late, great Mark Trickey.  
   
“He was an absolute champion,” Balderas said of the Lorne sporting identity who died of cancer this week. 

“He was a great man. He’d go out of his way to help anyone. You couldn’t say a bad thing about him. We used to knock around together at the club, on footy trips and so on. 

“You couldn’t fault him in any way. He was the best speaker I’ve ever heard. He didn’t need any notes — it was straight off the cuff and just inspirational­. 

“I was going to ask him to speak at my funeral.” 

Trickey died on Monday “after a long and courageous struggle”. He was 58. 

He is survived by wife Julianne­, sons Simon, Shane and Boe and grandchildren Jax and Indiana. 
 
The Lorne community is in mourning for the much-loved family man, who devoted his life to many of the town’s sporting clubs and community groups. 

Trickey was the president of the Lorne Country Club and has been lauded for his role in helping the golf entity escape difficult times. 

He was a life member and premiership coach of Lorne Football Club, where he played more than 180 games. 

Trickey was named at full back in the Dolphins’ Team of the CDFL Era from 1971 to 2006 and he was the 1978 senior best and fairest. He played in Lorne’s 1980 premiership before moving to coach Birregurra in 1981 and 1982. 

The champion defender returned to Stribling Reserve to coach the Dolphins to the 1983 flag. He also coached Lorne in 1985. 

“He was a good, strong player,” Balderas said. “Being a backman, he knew when to spoil. He wasn’t overly fast but he was a good, solid player.” 

Trickey was a standout cricketer for Lorne, winning the 1979-80 and 1984-85 bowling averages and belted a century in a distinguished career. 

He was also an impressive golfer, winning a club championship, and played on single figures for most of his life. His handicap was as low as four. 

In recent years Trickey was football operations manager. 

“He took care of all of the players,” Lorne president Ken Hosking said. “He was a highly esteemed member of the football club; he was respected, his views were respected. 

“I was speaking to (former senior coach) Jason Langdon and he was a mentor to him and he was a mentor to me when I started as president. 

“He was always around the club but his focus in recent years was at the golf club, where he was president. He had a lot of work to do there and he managed to get the club back on track. 

“He’s always been involved in successful operations in community work around town.” 

Trickey was also on the Lorne Foreshore committee and a member of the Lions Village committee. 

“He was just a tower of strength in whatever he was involved in,” Hosking said. “He put his heart and soul into everything. I was part of the Lorne Lions committee and that was another group he devoted a lot of time to. He did a lot of community stuff behind the scenes. He was a likable guy and he lived and loved life. He was taken too soon.” 

The funeral service will be held at 2.30pm on Friday at the Lorne Country Club.",b18440e8-6a5c-424a-aaa0-848103c83448,News,2015-09-22T15:01:41Z,Geelong Advertiser,Town mourns ‘a tower of strength’,0.0,Blog

3098,"Cherokee Sheriff’s Office investigators are asking for assistance in locating a vehicle that they said was used in an attempted child abduction. 
  
A spokesman for the agency said the incident occurred around 8 a.m., Sept. 1, on Deer Hollow Drive in Woodstock. 
 
The vehicle was described by investigators as being a two-door, white SUV with possible red paint, rust or red dirt at the bottom of the driver’s side door. The vehicle, authorities said, resembles a Mercury Mountaineer or Ford Explorer, and could have black rims and a slight tint on the windows. 
 
Officials with the sheriff’s office described the driver as being a white man with short gray hair. 
 
“He was described as not having any facial hair; however, he was wearing sunglasses with a circular frame,” Cpl. Darin Downey said. “The driver did have a black tattoo on his left bicep that is described as a possible tribal tattoo.” 
 
The driver, Downey said, was last seen wearing a grayish/brown shirt that might have had partially cutoff sleeves.

3847,"Oba Sikiru Adetona, the Awujale and paramount ruler of Ijebuland, has accused former President Olusegun Obasanjo of being nepotistic by influencing the upgrade and making of Abeokuta, then a rustic town, as Ogun State capital in 1976. 
 
The first class, Ogun State monarch, said at the weekend, during the turbanning ceremony of Princess Khadijat Adebisi Edionsere as the first Iya Suna of Ogun State by the Muslims Council, that Obasanjo used his influence and power as the second in command then, to ensure that capital of Ogun State was given to his home town, Abeokuta. 
 
He revealed that Abeokuta was never recommended among cities under consideration as the state capital by the then military administration of late General Murtala Muhammed in 1976, adding that the then Chief of Staff, Supreme Headquarters, Lieutenant General, now former President Olusegun Obasanjo changed the system and favoured Abeokuta overnight. 
 
The monarch, however, explained that the action of the former president proved him “to be a true son of Abeokuta”, saying: “It is good to use your position to positively affect your people. 
 
“When Ogun State was to be created, Abeokuta was not the city recommended as state capital. But, because Obasanjo was the second in command, he took the capital to Abeokuta. I don’t condemn his action, I am only saying our people should learn from that.” 
 
While lauding Governor Amosun for ongoing construction projects in the state, the leader of Muslims Ummah in Ogun state, dismissed allegations in some quarters that the governor is concentrating more on Abeokuta in terms of development, adding that state capitals around the world enjoy certain rights and privileges that befit their status. 
 
“We have bridges in Ijebu-Ode, Sagamu, Abeokuta and Ilaro. The governor is touching everywhere. Abeokuta is the state capital just like Abuja or Lagos and therefore should be treated as a state capital.” 
 
He then charged the newly installed Muslims’ Women leader, Princess Adebisi Edionsere to continue her support for propagation of Islam through dedication and philanthropic activities.

1846,"The Washington Post’s Barry Svrluga has a deep, perfectly-timed dive into the Washington National’s disaster of a season. Not only is it a complete tick-tock of how the team fell apart, it features a number of quotes and anecdotes from inside the locker room, each one revealing that Matt Williams’s performance as manager was, somehow, even worse than you imagined. 
 
There’s a lot to be drawn from Svrluga’s story, so you should definitely go read the whole thing , but the biggest revelation is that nobody on the team seems to think much of Williams. 
 
Here’s one anonymous Nationals player talking about Williams’s various strategic missteps : 
  
   
“The first time he does something odd, you’re like, ‘All right, I see, I get it, I’m with you,’” one Nationals veteran said. “The next time you’re like, ‘Ooookay. All right. I’m trying to get it. Yeah.’ And then when it keeps happening, guys are watching him like, ‘Well, here comes this guy again.’” 
 
Not every manager needs to have Joe Maddon’s ability to inspire confidence in order to be successful, but I’m fairly certain that “Well, here comes this guy again,” is not a thing that many good managers have had said about them by their own players. 
 
It gets even worse! One of the things consistently brought up to Svrluga by the players he talked to is Williams’s apparent lack of interest in communicating with his players, a source of friction that eventually led to a blowup when Williams failed to inform Jayson Werth that he was going to be out of the lineup one day: 
 
According to individuals with direct knowledge of the situation, Werth hadn’t received such a message from Williams. This wasn’t the first time, and Werth wasn’t the first veteran to experience what players considered an oversight once, an egregious error beyond that. 

What might have been a minor blip in a successful season became a boiling point. Incensed, Werth ripped the lineup card off the wall, bellowing that it was going to change. Then, according to several people who were present, he confronted Williams — not just about whether he would play that day, but about what most of the clubhouse considered to be a chronic lack of communication with his players. Among the most jarring barbs, from Werth to Williams: “When exactly do you think you lost this team?” 
 
Referencing that same confrontation, another player had this to say about Williams: 
 
“He’s like the guy in his house who hears a sound, like someone breaking in,” one player said. “And his reaction isn’t to take care of the problem or investigate. It’s to put his head under the pillow and hope it goes away.” 
 
About a year ago, Matt Williams was voted the N.L. Manager of the Year. Since then, he’s presided over the stunning collapse of a team that should have been a lock for the playoffs and transformed himself into baseball’s version of Michael Scott. It’s just too bad we’ll never see what he had in store for next season, because this dude is definitely getting fired. (In fact, how has he not been?)

5435,"The Master allows things to happen.  She shapes events as they come.  She steps out of the way  and lets the Tao speak for itself. (Tao Te Ching) In life we feel often feel insecure and uncertain about how our day is going to unfold. Every morning we wake up with a different mood, different thoughts, and worry about the challenges that we are about to face that day. But then, often the issues that worry us in the morning disappear as the day goes on. As we keep observing, we discover that the biggest trouble makers is really our mind, painting scary scenarios, and getting us worry about it. But if, on the other hand, we just let life happen as it does, things resolve by themselves. Emotions rise and the fall, thoughts come and the go; we just observe them like an outsider while life happens.
As we watch this movie over and over again, we become centered and stable. We allow and observe whatever life brings to us moment by moment. We experience, observe, and accept every moment that comes with clarity and openness. We are simply present as life unfolds.  Sometimes we are indifferent to what is happening; sometimes we get involved and run with it. Whatever we may end up doing, it is all good as long as the observer in us is doing his job. 
We have a choice. We can be here with the mission to achieve something and become someone. But that brings pressures, disappointments, and sometimes, renders us ineffective. We can also be here just to learn, to experience and to discover who we truly are. When we do that, life becomes light, full of fun, and filled with possibilities! Will you join us?

3593,"By By | Reuters  –  
By Philip Pullella and Jeff Mason 
 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Wednesday urged the United States to help tackle climate change and touched on other divisive U.S. political issues such as immigration and economic inequality on his first visit to the world's richest nation. 
 
In a speech on the White House South Lawn on the first full day of his U.S. trip, the Argentine pontiff lauded President Barack Obama's efforts to reduce air pollution as ""encouraging,"" months after Francis made the environment one of his top concerns by issuing a landmark encyclical letter to the church. 
 
""It seems clear to me also that climate change is a problem which can no longer be left to a future generation. When it comes to the care of our common home, we are living at a critical moment of history,"" the pope said at a welcoming ceremony. 
 
In an era of renewed U.S. racial tensions, the 78-year-old pope invoked America's best-known civil rights leader, the late Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., to make points about the environment and equality. 
 
The pope later said Mass in Spanish to about 25,000 gathered inside and outside the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception and canonized 18th-century Spanish missionary Friar Junipero Serra. The canonization was controversial because critics say that Serra beat and imprisoned Native Americans, suppressed their cultures and facilitated the spread of diseases that heavily reduced the population. 
 
During the first canonization on U.S. soil, Francis in a homily hailed Serra as a man who ""sought to defend the dignity of the native community, to protect it from those who had mistreated and abused it."" Some Native American activists condemned making Serra a saint, with one, Corrina Gould, saying Serra intended to wipe out the native people. 
 
Speaking to American bishops at the Cathedral of St. Matthew, Francis said the sex abuse of minors by clergy should never be repeated, acknowledging the damage caused by years of scandal in the U.S. Catholic Church. 
 
The pope referred to the bishops' ""generous commitment to bring healing to victims."" But David Clohessy, head of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, who himself was sexually assaulted by a priest as a child, said, ""Bishops have been cowardly, not courageous, and still are."" 
 
As Washington streets were closed and federal workers stayed home, about 15,000 people gathered in bright sunshine and warm temperatures on the South Lawn. They heard the pope depart from his usual practice and give a speech in English. 
 
He again made a gesture of simplicity, pulling up in the small black Fiat car he used for his arrival in the U.S. capital on Tuesday. 
 
Francis is a critic of the damage caused to the world's poor and the environment by capitalism's excesses. The pope also commented on immigration and religious freedom, issues on the U.S. political agenda ahead of the November 2016 presidential election. 
 
'SACRED OBLIGATION' 
 
Obama, whose plans for climate change legislation were thwarted in Congress early in his presidency, said he shared the pope's concerns about the environment. 
 
""Holy Father, you remind us that we have a sacred obligation to protect our planet: God's magnificent gift to us. We support your call to all world leaders to support the communities most vulnerable to a changing climate and to come together to preserve our precious world for future generations,"" Obama said. 
 
Francis and Obama held about 40 minutes of talks in the White House. An interpreter was the only other person present and the White House declined to detail the talks. Both men see eye-to-eye on climate change and defense of the poor but hold different views on abortion rights and gay marriage. 
 
Francis gave his support to traditional marriage, pointing out that he will travel to Philadelphia later in his six-day visit to the United States for a meeting of Catholics ""to celebrate and support the institutions of marriage and the family."" The U.S. Supreme Court in June legalized same-sex marriage across the United States. 
 
In an apparent nod to the fierce debate in the United States about illegal immigration, Francis described himself as the son of an immigrant Italian family in Argentina. ""I am happy to be a guest in this country, which was largely built by such families,"" he said at the White House. 
 
The pope also said U.S. Catholics are committed to building a ""truly tolerant and inclusive"" society that rejects discrimination. Francis also mentioned the ""millions of people living under our system, which has overlooked them."" 
 
""I would like all men and women of goodwill in this great nation to support the efforts of the international community to protect the vulnerable in our world,"" the pope said. 
 
Adoring crowds waving white-and-yellow Vatican flags cheered the pontiff on a parade through Washington streets as the leader of the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics sprinkled some stardust in a city not unduly impressed with important foreign visitors. 
 
At one point, he had his converted Jeep stop when he saw a baby in the crowd. Francis was handed the 5-month-old son of Salvadoran immigrants who live in Virginia, and kissed the boy, Loukas Chavez, on the head. 
 
""I just thought it was an unbelievable moment,"" said the baby's mother, Iris Chavez, 25, her daughter, Emely, almost 2, in her arms. 
 
The first Latin American pope, Francis has electrified liberal-leaning U.S. Catholics, Democrats and many non-Catholics with a shift in emphasis toward concern for the poor and immigrants and his appeals to combat climate change. But his criticism of unbridled capitalism has unsettled U.S. conservatives. 
 
Francis will give the first speech by any pope to the U.S. Congress on Thursday, an address to the U.N. General Assembly in New York on Friday and an open-air Mass in Philadelphia where 1.5 million people are expected to attend on Sunday.

2613,"The Employee of the Month for September for the Liberty County Sheriff’s Office is 15-year veteran employee, Bonnie Bishop, who is the commissary clerk for the jail division of the sheriff’s office. 
  
Sheriff Bobby Rader’s selection committee for this monthly honor found the selection process rather easy to select Bishop for this designation as she is highly praised by her supervisors for her work ethics as well as her vast knowledge of the workings of the agency itself. 
 
“There are many positions within any organization that work behind the scenes in order for the entire organization to function at a high level of proficiency. Bonnie heads up one of those type positions that is probably little known to the general public and often times, receives little recognition for the day to day operations that the sheriff’s office is obligated to fulfill,” said Capt. Ken DeFoor, LCSO spokesperson, in a written statement. “However, to those people immediately effected by Bonnie’s office and the functions that she is charged with overseeing, it is abundantly clear to those individuals just how important the commissary clerk’s office is to them.” 
 
The commissary clerk’s primary responsibility is to account for the monies that inmates have on them when they are brought into the jail facility as well as money orders that may be sent in by family members for commissary items for their friends or family members who are in the county jail. 
 
“Then when these inmates are released, it’s Bonnie’s responsibility to issue checks for any funds these people may have coming to them. She also handles the phone cards, which allows inmates to communicate with friends or family members outside the facility,” he said. “Needless to say, this accounting must be exact and with proper documentation of all monies accounted for while the inmate is in detention as well as upon their release. This is, by no means, a small task and Bonnie excels at this assignment.” 
 
Bishop was born in Duarte, Calif., and when she was 6 years old, her family moved to Humble, Texas, where she eventually graduated from high school and moved to Liberty County at the young age of 17. As time moved on, she accepted a job with the U.S. Postal service, but due to other work she had been doing with the elderly and persons with health issues, she wanted something more where she felt she could be of benefit to the community at large. 
 
When an opportunity presented itself to join the Liberty County Sheriff’s Office as a dispatcher, this seemed to be the position that she had been seeking. So, in June, 2000, Bonnie became a dispatcher and has worked for four sheriffs thus far. She has chalked up well over 600 hours of dispatching and communications schooling. She says her first love is “watching out for our deputies on the streets.” 
 
When asked what her most memorable calls were when she worked both as a dispatcher supervisor and handling calls herself, Bishop immediately becomes emotional when she recalls that she took a 911 call that night, in 2002, when a Liberty County deputy was killed in a patrol car wreck while en route to a call. This was not only just a sheriff’s deputy, but a close friend as well. 
 
One other call that stands out in her memory is a 911 call from a 14 year old boy who pleaded for help because he knew when his parents got home that he would be beaten with a 1” X 4” board. Bishop was on the telephone listening to the beating as a patrol deputy was en route to the scene. 
 
She was later able to meet the young man who, tearfully, thanked her for saving him from further beatings and physical abuse from his parents. The commissary clerk’s position is a great deal less stressful, as Bishop is quick to point out, but her first love still remains with dispatching and watching out for the sheriff’s deputies. 
 
Bishop is married to Corporal Hugh Bishop, also a longtime veteran with the sheriff’s office, and says that her two young children take up about 90 percent of her off duty time. But it still leaves a little time for her favorite past time of watching sports on television as well as NASCAR races and such. This honor of receiving “Employee Of The Month” was also a special gift as it happened to be the 12th wedding anniversary for the Bishops. 
 
Bishop said she was shocked at being selected as September’s “Employee Of The Month” but it was a very pleasant surprise and an honor that she will cherish for many years. She wants to thank everyone that had anything to do with her selection.",19b01455-3c9e-4f95-9225-d270df982054,News,2015-09-07T05:13:00Z,Dayton News,Bishop named LCSO employee of month for September,0.0,Blog
290,"TRYSTER ended his 2015 campaign where it began on Saturday night, when he took his all-weather record to six wins out of six with a victory at Chelmsford on his first start since May.

The Godolphin colt, who won the very first race at the track when it reopened in January, set a new course record when he beat Let's Go by half a length in a £40,000 conditions race.

He will now head to Dubai, where he will be given the chance to demonstrate whether he could develop into a World Cup contender.

Tryster, who won the Winter Derby and Easter Classic in the spring, had not run since finishing last of five in the Brigadier Gerard Stakes, his only race on turf this year. Trainer Charlie Appleby said: ""I was delighted with Tryster. He's back on track again having had a break after Sandown - he'd been on the go for the winter. You could question whether he adapted to turf, but I still feel it was the combination of the style of racing and small field.

""As we saw last night, he likes to be dropped in deep and come from off a sensible pace. He did it well and the plan now is to take him to Dubai, look at the second round of the Maktoum Challenge, and see how that works out. If it doesn't there's plenty of time to come back for another crack at the Winter Derby and Easter Classic.""",e659fb49-ef83-4af6-a409-1e861706858e,News,2015-09-28T06:30:00Z,RacingPost.com,Tryster heads to Dubai next for World Cup warm up,0.0,Blog

his is Susan King, a 25-year veteran entertainment reporter at the Los Angeles Times, and guardian of the Golden Age of Hollywood galaxy. Every Friday, I have the opportunity to share my passion and love for everything vintage in the Classic Hollywood newsletter. Sit back and enjoy what’s new in classic films and TV, on DVD and Blu-ray, fun events around town, movie and TV milestones, notable births and deaths.
This week, Fathom and Turner Classic Movies have teamed up for special theatrical engagements Sept. 20 and 23 of Alfred Hitchcock’s influential 1960 thriller “Psycho,” starring Anthony Perkins in his iconic turn as the ultimate mother’s boy, Norman Bates, and the Oscar-nominated Janet Leigh as the ill-fated Marion Crane. If you never have seen this shocker on the big screen, this is a wonderful opportunity to see a great print complete with an introduction by TCM host Ben Mankiewicz.

Five years ago, I chatted with the late Hilton A. Green, who was the film’s assistant director. According to Green, it wasn’t really the brutal shower stabbing that caused problems with censors; it was the sight of a toilet.
“They wanted to cut the shot of the toilet where Janet Leigh tears up the note and flushes it down the toilet,” he said.  “You couldn’t show a toilet on screen. Can you imagine that?”
Hitch opted to shoot the film in black-and-white with a lower budget than that of his usual productions.
“He was still shooting ‘North by Northwest’ when he started to prepare ‘Psycho,’” recalled Green, who became a producer. “North by Northwest"" was his “biggest-budget movie at that time, and he wanted to prove to Hollywood that he could make a quality low-budget movie, which was  the script of ‘Psycho.'”
Green noted that the Master of Suspense was actually an introvert.
“Mr. Hitchcock had a TV crew and a feature crew,” Green said.  “He didn’t feel comfortable around new faces. That’s  why he always kept his same crew intact. When he went do to ‘Psycho,’ he felt with the budget and the schedule ‘Psycho’ had, his TV crew was the better choice to do it.”A welcome return
I’m always wistful when I drive by the Fine Arts Theatre on Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills. Though the Art Deco gem from 1937 is occasionally used for screenings, it has been basically closed for several years. I have such fond memories of going to films there when I first moved to California -- especially attending a lively matinee of the 1930s Errol Flynn classics “Captain Blood” and  “The Adventures of Robin Hood.” But good news!
The Laemmle chain, which operated the theater from 1985 to 1993, has welcomed the Fine Arts back into the fold. Laemmle has renamed it the Ahrya Fine Arts and is reopening it Friday with the documentary “Jeremy Scott: The People’s Designer.”Don’t touch that dial
Who’s on TCM Friday night? None other than Bud Abbott and Lou Costello. TCM is screening several of the legendary team’s Universal comedy hits, including its 1941 blockbuster “Buck Privates,” which features the Andrew Sisters singing the Oscar-nominated “Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy”; 1941’s “Hold That Ghost” and “In the Navy”; 1942’s “Rio Rita”; and 1944’s “Lost in a Harem.”’

Though most of the comedy teams of that time, including the Marx Brothers, the Three Stooges and the Ritz Brothers, appealed to the male of the species, Abbott and Costello have always had a strong female following.
“We have a lot of women in the fan club,” Lou’s daughter, Chris Costello, once told me.  “Of course, it’s because Dad’s so cute and naive, you just want to mother him. People were a little bit more prone to build empathy for Dad because he was always getting slapped around. He was sweet. He was like a little boy who didn’t grow up.”
Though her father got most of the laughs in their films, Chris Costello praised Abbott as “the ultimate straight man. Unfortunately, he never received the accolades he should have. Bud Abbott was one of the most gentle human beings  on the face of the planet.”
The duo loved to pull pranks on their sets. “They would cellophane the toilets,” she said. “They had people around them from burlesque to keep the energy level up. Dad and Bud were two of the people who were initiators of the wrap party.”Around town
The American Cinematheque’s Aero Theatre is celebrating the 40th anniversary of Robert Altman’s masterpiece “Nashville” on Friday evening. Ronee Blakley, who earned a supporting actress Oscar nomination, and music supervisor Richard Baskin will be on hand to discuss the film. The evening will also pay tribute to the late Jerry Weintraub, who was an executive producer of the influential ensemble film that earned five Oscar nominations, winning best song for Keith Carradine’s “I’m Easy.”

1586,"Cheryl Dunn: New York SoulCheryl Dunn was born in Old Tappan, NJ, and currently resides in New York City. She received her BA in Art History from Rutgers University. Cheryl has had numerous group and solo exhibitions around the world, and has had several books published, including “She Swallowed It,” “Sometimes the Answer,” and “Some Kinda Vacation.” Below she speaks to Alex Coghe about her photographic efforts and her film “Everybody Street,” which documents the lives and works of New York’s iconic street photographers and the city that inspires them. Q: How and when did you get started with photography? A: I have been shooting pictures since I was a teenager. In my early 20’s, I went to Europe and lived for 2 years. I did not speak the language of the countries I was living in, so sometimes I wouldn’t speak for weeks. I walked the streets, took pictures, and looked at art most of the time. My observational skills became quite keen because that is all I had really. I would make up stories about people, and what was happening in a scene, and I guess this is when I really started to do street photography. When I returned home, I became a photo assistant and did personal documentary projects. Photography was the only thing that fully engaged me in every way. Q: You are a great street photographer, but you do commercial work too. I love both souls of your work, and I consider your work with models to be very inspiring. Do you feel there is a way to integrate your documentary vision into your commercial work? I am particularly interested to learn about your experience as a street photographer as you made stunning works on assignment for your clients. A: I embrace the challenges of assignments. I like to shoot assignments and fashion on the streets because of the uncontrollable variables. A fashion shoot on the street is not necessarily documentary in nature but when you go to the streets to do something, you are in a sea of other people and anything can and does happen, particularly when you are shooting models; it’s really fun and funny. At this point of my career, I get hired to do what I do for the most part, which is awesome. So I get to put the documentary, discovery, and the unpredictability of street photography into my work most of the time. As a street photographer, you really have to react fast, predict behavior, chase light, or wait for action to happen. All of these skills are very helpful while doing assignments. On the street, maybe you don’t have a time limit to make the shot, but you certainly do on assignment. Being able to see the best situation quickly and solve problems fast comes from all of these shooting experiences. You just get better at it. Q: Apart from still photography, you are also a filmmaker. How did you get started making films? A: I started making films in the mid ’90s. I always seemed to be shooting film of artists and sub-cultures, and I also documented a lot of graffiti writers. I thought it was super important to document artists and their processes, because things change so fast, so that is why I started making films about individual creatives and collaborations between artists. Q: Your 2013 documentary “Everybody Street” is considered one of the best films ever dedicated to photography, and you received a lot of awards for it. When did you get the idea to make this film? A: I was asked by a museum in lower Manhattan to come up with a film idea that could play within an Alfred Stieglitz exhibition, so I pitched the idea to make a film about photographers who went to the streets of NY, and created a substantial body of work inspired by that practice. Selfishly, I wanted to meet my idols (and I did) after showing the short at the museum, and then I was invited to show it at the Tate modern. I went back into the project to expand it to feature-length because there was so much more to say. Quoting a review about the movie: “I appreciate the diversity of thought and approach in the street that Dunn’s documentary depicts: this is an invitation to reflect for everyone. There is not homologation, and this is an invitation to reflect for everyone. We can see photographers more focused on portraits, others on the decisive moment. Bruce Gilden is very different by Joel Meyerowitz…” Q: I think the great merit of this movie is how it presents a diversity of approach and aesthetics without simply demonstrating a way to take pictures in the street. Do you agree? Aren’t we all street photographers? A: Yes, I agree. I wanted to show all the different ways people do it. The photographers in my film are all very different, with varied approaches. There are so many great street photographers, but there is more to photography than simply pressing a button. Q: “Everybody Street” presents New York City as the city for excellence in street photography. What are some of the unique characteristics that come with taking street photography here? A: The one thing about NY that makes it interesting for me is the way the light is here. Manhattan is a small island surrounded by water. Skyscrapers of glass and steel, and tons of people in concentration. Light is bouncing everywhere; people are on top of each other with crazy scenes unfolding before your eyes. It’s ripe for street photographers. Q: And do you think the Big Apple still represents the capital of street photography? A: There are many great cities for street photography as populations increase all over the world. But in the last century, NY was the center of the arts, it was in what they called “The New World.” This city was having an industrial revolution and most of all, it is maybe one of the most multicultural cities; there is every type of person walking the streets. And yes, it is a city that everyone walks in. Q: Among all the photographers presented and interviewed in the documentary, do you have a favorite? A: Not really. They are all so different, and I am a fan of each of them. I became good friends with Jill Freedman and Boogie in the making of the film. Q: It’s been two years, is there anything you wish you could change about the project? A: This film took me four years. And what I want to change is having more time to shoot on the streets. Q: Are you preparing another documentary? What will be the theme this time? A: Yes, I am starting on a new film about the New York artist Dash Snow. I think the ’60s and ’70s, but also the ’80s in the Big Apple with photographers like Garry Winogrand and Joel Meyerowitz, and then Bruce Gilden and Bruce Davidson, representing an unrepeatable period for this genre. They choose to go out to take pictures as a genuine need; they never imagined that they would become recognized as the masters today, when street photographers are living in the social network era where everyone thinks of being famous. Q: What is the state of Street Photography today? And what are the main differences from the golden era of street photography? A: There are great street photographers today, but the judge of what is great now are followers on Instagram and likes. And who are those people? Are they the same people that make Instagram accounts about cats and dogs the most popular? So who is really deciding what is great or not now? It is a different time. The golden age of photography included artists that knew every aspect of the medium and did them all –processing film, printing pictures, etc. They all had darkrooms. They were artisans. Most people that are popular on Instagram don’t know anything about that stuff. And does it matter? I don’t know, but that is one of the differences. Q: Is there an artist that you feel shares your attitude and approach to the photographic medium? A: In my film I would say Boogie. (Bruce Davidson) Q: What does street photography mean to you? A: It’s something I need to do. I am always riddled with anxiety because I have a lot of other work to do, and I don’t get to the streets as much as I want to. Q: How did you first become interested in Leica? A: I think probably studying the masters: Cartier-Bresson, Bruce Davidson, Garry Winogrand, and the like. I wanted to be as nimble and quick as I could, and I knew this was my camera. It took me a while to save up for the gear I have. Since Leica really stands the test of time, it’s fine to buy used gear, and I have done that a lot, one piece at a time; if I got a decent job, I would buy a new lens or something. It’s just the best camera for me, such a beautiful machine. The lenses are incredible, and I can handle the weight. I am always shooting them, so they are like an extension of my body at this point. Q: You are using Leica M6, M7, and M9. Do you have you a preference between film and digital photography? When you prefer to use film? When do you go digital? A: I shoot film mostly for my personal work. I’m trying to like digital more. I use it commercially more so, but my film pictures are what I love. Q: Do you have any favorite lens? A: I mostly had a 35 f/1.2. for so long. Then a 90 mm, and a 21 mm. After that, I got the 50 mm f/1.4 Summilux. I love it so much. The last one I got was a 28 mm ASPH. Q: What about Leica today? What are the reasons your cameras are Leica, and not from other brands? A: They are like a beautiful diamond ring: forever the best. Q: If you could test a new Leica camera what would it be, and why? A: I would like to try the Monochrom. I just ran into Boogie in my neighborhood, and he was rocking one. He kept going on about how great it was. And I have heard this from other people as well. I would like to try it. Q: What are some of your challenges? What will be the new goals for Cheryl Dunn? A: A balance of film and photography, and being able to have the time to explore the subjects that inspire me.

1119,"FOXBORO – The first cut isn’t the deepest in the NFL. The second one is. This past Tuesday, teams were required to cut their rosters from the 90 men they were permitted to bring to training camp to 75. By 4 p.m. Saturday, teams will be required to cut to the regular-season limit of 53. In the Patriots’ case that means at least 21 of the players who were on their active roster for Thursday night’s 12-9 loss to the New York Giants in the teams’ preseason finale at Gillette Stadium will no longer be there come Saturday night. While the Patriots are currently at 75, with running back LeGarrette Blount staring at a one-game suspension for violating the league’s substance abuse policy, they’ll be allowed to actually carry 54 players into the regular season. “It’s an unfortunate part of the game when you can’t keep all of the players who have worked hard and done everything that you’ve asked them to do,” Patriots head coach Bill Belichick said recently. “You have to make some tough decisions, but that’s part of it. That’s the National Football League. Not the great part of the job.” Don’t think that the Patriots’ active roster will necessarily be set come Saturday night, however. In addition to establishing their 10-man roster (a process that can be undertaken on Sunday), the Patriots made 11 moves involving their active roster following the league’s final cutdown date a year ago. Obviously, in hosting Pittsburgh as the reigning Super Bowl champions in the NFL regular-season kickoff at Gillette on Sept. 10, the Patriots (like the Steelers) will be operating within a much tighter time constraint this year. Who are those guys?: Google the term “amateur hour” in today’s Internet world and you’re liable to find a YouTube video of Thursday night’s game. Even under the variable pricing format the Patriots implemented for their season ticket holders a year ago this one was overpriced. Consider some of the central figures in this NFL non-classic: Ryan Lindley threw 45 times, completing 22 for 253 yards and no touchdowns (there weren’t any scored on this night) with one interception in a complete-game effort for the Patriots that concluded with him getting sacked by Giants defensive end Damontre’ Moore and coughing up the ball for a turnover at the New York 12 in the final minute. Ryan Nassib completed 16-of-32 passes for 193 yards and no TDs with no interceptions for the Giants. Tight end Asante Cleveland, he of the zero career receptions in six regular-season games, tied for the Patriots’ team lead with four catches for 38 yards; Page 2 of 2 - Linebacker-defensive lineman Xzavier Dickson, the Patriots’ 253rd and last pick in this year’s draft, was the team’s second-leading tackler in the game with seven. Keep those names in mind. Some of them will soon be appearing in the “NFL transactions” section of a newspaper near you. Oh, well, at least those in attendance will always be able to tell their grandchildren about the night they saw Chris Boswell outkick Stephen Gostkowski, four field goals to three, in Foxboro. On this night, Tom Brady didn’t even take the field – for warmups.

3950,"LEIDEN, the Netherlands, Sept. 14, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ProQR Therapeutics N.V. ( NASDAQ:PRQR ) today announced that PQ-010-002 is open for enrollment. The primary objective of PQ-010-002 is to estimate the effect of topical administration of QR-010 on the nasal mucosa in the restoration of CFTR function, as measured by Nasal Potential Difference (NPD). PQ-010-002 is an open-label, exploratory study evaluating the effect of QR-010 in ∆F508 homozygous (carry two allelic copies) and compound heterozygous (carry one copy of the ∆F508 mutation and one other disease causing mutation) cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. QR-010 is a novel investigational RNA therapeutic designed to repair the genetic mutation in the mRNA of CF patients due to the ∆F508 mutation. 

""We are excited to announce that the second clinical study of QR-010 is now open and enrolling,"" said Noreen R. Henig, MD, Chief Development Officer of ProQR. ""This study is an important proof-of-concept study that will test the activity of QR-010 in the treatment of CF. In animal models of CF, QR-010 showed the ability to restore CFTR mediated NPD to normal or wild-type levels. Repeating the same test in individuals with CF will provide an important first signal of the therapeutic potential of QR-010."" 
   
PQ-010-002 is a 28-day study conducted in up to 5 sites located in the US and Europe that are experienced in conducting NPD measurements. NPD is a well-accepted diagnostic test for CF and recently has been used to assess therapeutic benefit in clinical trials of investigational agents. The study will enroll at least 16 people with CF that are either homozygous or compound heterozygous for the ∆F508 mutation. NPD and sweat chloride measurements will be done before and after local treatment in the nose with QR-010 three times a week for four weeks. 

""RNA-based therapeutics are a novel approach to the treatment of the gene mutations that cause CF. The preclinical nasal potential difference studies of QR-010 in the mouse models of CF are quite compelling. The proof-of-concept study of QR-010 will support the understanding of QR-010's impact on CFTR function in patients with CF with the common ∆F508 CFTR mutation,"" said John P. Clancy, Professor of Pediatrics and Research Director, Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Cincinnati Children's Hospital and a member of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutic Development Network's leadership team. 

PQ-010-002 will be conducted in parallel with PQ-010-001, the ongoing Phase 1b safety and tolerability study of QR-010 in CF patients homozygous for the ∆F508 mutation. In addition to safety and tolerability, PQ-010-001 will assess pharmacokinetics and exploratory clinical efficacy endpoints. In the Phase 1b study, QR-010 is delivered to the lungs via inhalation. 

""We are very proud of our teams that have moved QR-010 from an interesting idea to two enrolling clinical studies in just three years,"" said Daniel A. de Boer, Chief Executive Officer of ProQR. ""We are committed to bringing important new therapies to patients with CF and these studies are important steps in understanding the potential of QR-010."" 

About CF 

CF is a genetic disease that affects an estimated 70,000 to 100,000 patients worldwide and causes early morbidity and mortality. CF currently has no cure. The median age of death for CF patients is 27, and more than 90% of CF patients die from respiratory failure. CF is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes for a protein called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR. For some patients with specific CF mutations, there are therapies available that aim to treat the basic defect of the disease. For many patients however, more efficacious medicines are needed because a substantial unmet medical need remains. The ∆F508 mutation that we are targeting is the most prevalent and is present in approximately 70% of all CF patients. In people with CF, this mutated gene and the resulting defective protein lead to the dysfunction of multiple organ systems, including the lungs, pancreas and gastrointestinal tract. In the lung airways, absence of functional CFTR protein leads to unusually thick, sticky mucus that clogs the lungs and increases vulnerability to chronic, life-threatening lung infections. 

About QR-010 

QR-010 is a first-in-class RNA-based oligonucleotide designed to address the underlying cause of the disease by repairing the mRNA defect encoded by the ∆F508 mutation in the CFTR gene of CF patients. The ∆F508 mutation is a deletion of three of the coding base pairs, or nucleotides, in the CFTR gene, which results in the production of a misfolded CFTR protein that does not function normally. QR-010 is designed to bind to the defective CFTR mRNA and guide the insertion of the three missing nucleotides, thus repairing the mRNA and subsequently producing wild-type, or normal CFTR protein. QR-010 is designed to be self-administered through a small, handheld aerosol delivery device, or nebulizer, in the form of a mist inhaled into the lungs. We believe this method could allow maximum exposure of QR-010 to the primary target organ, the lung, as well as significant exposure to other affected organs through systemic absorption into the blood. QR-010 has been granted orphan drug designation in the United States and the European Union. 

About ProQR 

ProQR Therapeutics is dedicated to changing lives through the creation of transformative RNA medicines for the treatment of severe diseases such as cystic fibrosis and Leber's congenital amaurosis. Based on our unique proprietary RNA repair platform technologies we are growing our pipeline with patients and loved ones in mind. Since 2012.

4553,"BEHOLD, BLESS (affectionately and gratefully praise) the Lord, all you servants of the Lord, [singers] who by night stand in the house of the Lord.
Lift up your hands in holiness and to the sanctuary and bless the Lord [affectionately and gratefully praise Him]!
The Lord bless you out of Zion, even He Who made heaven and earth.
Psalm 134 Amp
We often pray for God's blessing on people. They may be our family, friends and ourselves. It may be a more general prayer for blessing on our church, workplace, school, neighbourhood, city and nations. And let's not forget God commands us to pray for blessing on people who have wronged us.
Finally, all [of you] should be of one and the same mind (united in spirit), sympathizing [with one another], loving [each other] as brethren [of one household], compassionate and courteous (tenderhearted and humble).
Never return evil for evil or insult for insult (scolding, tongue-lashing, berating), but on the contrary blessing [praying for their welfare, happiness, and protection, and truly pitying and loving them]. For know that to this you have been called, that you may yourselves inherit a blessing [from God—that you may obtain a blessing as heirs, bringing welfare and happiness and protection].
1 Peter 3:8-9 Amp
But how often do we pray asking God how we can be a blessing to Him? I clearly remember a conversation I had with a mature Christian not long after I was saved. We were staying with him and his wife for the weekend. As we were driving to church he was talking about the worship time in the service being a time when we had an opportunity to bless God, rather than a time of asking God to bless us. That conversation started a thought path that continues today, how can I be a blessing to God, not to gain His approval or love, as Jesus has already done that on my behalf. But rather as an act of appreciation and gratitude.
​O GOD, You are my God, earnestly will I seek You; my inner self thirsts for You, my flesh longs and is faint for You, in a dry and weary land where no water is.
So I have looked upon You in the sanctuary to see Your power and Your glory.
Because Your loving-kindness is better than life, my lips shall praise You.
So will I bless You while I live; I will lift up my hands in Your name.
My whole being shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise You with joyful lips
When I remember You upon my bed and meditate on You in the night watches.
For You have been my help, and in the shadow of Your wings will I rejoice.
My whole being follows hard after You and clings closely to You; Your right hand upholds me.
Psalms 63:1-8 Amp
From reading this passage from Psalm 63, we can see some ways we can bless the Lord
1. Earnestly seek Him (don't get distracted by other things and people)
2. Look upon Him ( keep our eyes focused on Him, no matter what is going on)
3. Praise Him (even when you don't feel like it)
4. Lift up my hands (an act of complete surrender to Him and His ways)
5. Remember (remember all that He has done for you, with a grateful heart)
6. Rejoice (in all He has done, is doing and has promised to do)
7. Follow hard (always look to Him purposefully to see where the next step is to be)
8. Cling closely ( as if your life here and for eternity depends upon Him, because it does)
And in desiring to bless the Lord, let's always remember
We love Him, because He first loved us. 
1 John 4:19 Amp
We are abundantly blessed, so today let's seek God on how we can be a blessing to our Him, and the world we live in.
And let us not lose heart and grow weary and faint in acting nobly and doing right, for in due time and at the appointed season we shall reap, if we do not loosen and relax our courage and faint.
So then, as occasion and opportunity open up to us, let us do good [morally] to all people [not onlybeing useful or profitable to them, but also doing what is for their spiritual good and advantage]. Be mindful to be a blessing, especially to those of the household of faith [those who belong to God’s family with you, the believers].Galatians 6:9-10 Amp",2babddf5-5af2-4d6a-ae7b-e170f20bdad9,Blog,2015-09-16T21:20:31Z,"Wendy, A God Girl",Bless (affectionately and gratefully praise) the Lord,1.0,Blog

982,"Victor Vito was the pick of the All Blacks' pack with a busy performance against a determined Namibia in London. 
             
 OPINION: The All Blacks continued their patchy Rugby World Cup form with a frustrating win over Namibia. Here's how we rated the individual efforts. 
 
 Colin Slade 6.5  
 
Proficient positioning at the back. Joined backline when he could and produced a couple of sweet passes. Got 11 minutes at first-five at start of second half before being subbed. 
 
 Nehe Milner-Skudder 8  
 
A big step up from nervous opener against the Pumas. Two tries made him the official man of the match. Some good steps and busted first tackle every time. Sweet hands to gift Codie Taylor the last try. 
 
 Malakai Fekitoa 6  
 
A mixed effort. Couple of nice touches to keep the ball alive. Quiet night with his own running game but showed right instincts to stay on Sonny Bill Williams' shoulder for a good try. Guilty of falling off the tackle that gave Namibia their try. 
 
 Sonny Bill Williams 8  
 
Carried on where he left off with his exciting cup opener. Showed his distribution is more than just offloads with some good wide passes. But pop-pass for Fekitoa's  try was sublime and produced a beautiful flick off the ground to keep movement alive for Skudder's second try. 
 
 Julian Savea 7  
 
Confidence-booster for the big wing who finally broke his 2015 test try drought with a brace. Wasn't given a lot of space out wide but went looking for work constantly and was a danger on the inside channel. Couple of drops under the high ball contributed to a sloppy second spell by the All Blacks. 
 
 Beauden Barrett 6.5  
 
Competent control at No 10. Showed blistering speed and eye for gap for his try. Good line kicking but guilty of over-doing chip kicks at times. Goalkicking still a concern with five out of nine attempts. 
 
 TJ Perenara 5  
 
Had an armchair ride behind a dominant pack. Content to move the ball with his passing and ignored his running game. Subbed after 47 minutes.

*  ABs put nine tries past Namibia 
 
 
 Victor Vito 8  
 
The pick of the pack. Looks comfortable at No 8 and showed good control at back of scrum. A lineout force and busy in all areas. Set the tone with his opening try and his game has real momentum at the moment. 
 
 Same Cane 7  
 
Handled the captaincy well, vocal and imploring his side to keep some shape against a committed opponent who were determined to slow the game down. Plenty of continuity play. Held the leadership when Richie McCaw was introduced for final quarter. 
    
 Jerome Kaino 6.5  
 
Solid as ever. Wasn't a night of huge tackle counts as All Blacks dominated position but Kaino made his hits count. Subbed for McCaw after 61 minutes. 
 
 Sam Whitelock 6.5  
 
Got an early lineout steal and was good at the restarts – an area of concern in the All Blacks game lately but one where they got plenty of practice. 
 
 Luke Romano 7.5  
 
Strong display with his physical approach. Asked to go the distance and was still firing at the finish. Couple of bruising runs and effective cleanout work at breakdown. 
 
 Charlie Faumuina 6.5  
 
A pleasing hour's work by the tighthead who has been short of rugby over recent months. Anchored a dominant scrum and popped up around the fringes as well as doing the grind.

 Codie Taylor 7  
 
Showed the All Blacks have strength in the hooking department. Accurate lineout throwing and solid in the scrums. Popped up increasingly with his running and rewarded with the last try, looming out wide. 
 
 Ben Franks 6.5  
 
Cost three points with an early penalty. Made up for that by scampering back to tidy up ugly situation in front of All Blacks' posts. Overpowered his opposite at scrum time. 
 
 RESERVES  
 
 Keven Mealamu  Not used 
 
 Wyatt Crockett 6  
 
Got on after 63 minutes and had a busy time amidst scrum resets. Knock-on when appearing in the backline. 
 
 Tony Woodcock   Not used 
 
 Kieran Read 6  
 
On after 51 minutes for Sam Whitelock. Proved he's able to be locking cover in an area where the team are travelling light and looking for versatility. 
 
 Richie McCaw 6  
 
On after 61 minutes for Kaino and took on blindside duties. Quiet time as game spluttered through frustrating final quarter. 
 
 Tawera Kerr-Barlow 6  
 
Got some much-needed game time in the black jersey with his last test almost a year ago. Content to be the link and produced a good option with a blindside pass for Savea's second try. 
 
 Ma'a Nonu 6  
 
On after 61 minutes for Williams to notch his 99th test. One good bust but struggled for impact as the game failed to flow. 
 
 Ben Smith 6  
 
On after 51 minutes for Slade to operate at fullback. Showed his nose for the try line by being in the right place at the right time.

5038,"Sage Agastya prayed to Lord Brahma and Lord Shiva to grant him a wish – would they create an abundant river that would water the lands in the south. The wish was granted. The two great Gods filled the sage’ kamandalu or water pot with a river. Wherever he choose to pour from the kamandalu – a river would gush forth. The wise sage then travelled to the South. He kept wandering from one place to another looking for an ideal location for the river. On the way he felt the call of nature and asked a little boy to take care of the sacred kamandalu for the time being.  The little boy was Lord Ganesha is disguise. He kept the kamandalu on the ground. A few moments later a crow sat on the pot, and overturned it as it flew away on being shooed by Sage Agastya. The river is known to us as Kaveri. Moral: Lord Ganesha has the welfare of all beings in his heart and he will act to ensure prosperity for his devotees even when they do not seek his assistance. Such is his affection. Such is his leela.

The crew who set out from Bray on the May 30 last will arrive back in Wicklow this afternoon. 

The rowers are raising money for the charity Cystic Fibrosis Ireland and have raised over €75,000 so far. 



Organiser of Row-Around-Ireland Ger Crowley said it was a challenging task to undertake. 

“There were hairy moments obviously when you go out in the North Atlantic it is very unpredictable,” he said. 

“We have no safety boat, we have no back-up boat with us or boat to accompany us around so when we headed out to sea, it was an adventure every time. 

“I must say thankfully that the weather was good to us and kind to us, conditions were chosen as to when we went out.”

1876,"Transaction Marks Third Disposition for JV in 2015 

DALLAS, TX--(Marketwired - September 16, 2015) - Sealy & Company, a fully-integrated commercial real estate investment and operating company and recognized leader in the industrial real estate market, and AEW Capital Management (AEW) announced the disposition of 200 Interstate South Drive in McDonough, Georgia. The Class A, multi-tenant bulk warehouse is located in the South Atlanta Industrial market, the second-largest submarket in Atlanta. The 434,760-square-foot property features modern amenities, a superior location, and national credit tenants. 200 Interstate South is located in the Interstate South Business Park and features four (4) ingress/egress points with excellent access to I-75 and high visibility. AEW sold the property on behalf of AEW Partners VII, L.P. 

When the property was acquired in 2013, it was 90% occupied and the in-place rents were 5 to 10% below historical market rental rates. Over the 24-month ownership period, Sealy & AEW successfully executed their strategy to increase occupancy to 100% and brought rents to at or above market while maintaining national credit tenant quality. This was achieved by completing a new 10-year lease for 300,000 square feet to a national credit tenant prior to the existing tenant’s termination and by renewing an existing tenant at a rental increase, both of which created value and enhanced the return upon disposition. 

“Sealy’s partnership with AEW has been a tremendous success due to our entrepreneurial approach, local market expertise, and ability to implement creative strategies that add value. We look forward to potential future opportunities with AEW,” stated Scott Sealy Jr., Vice President and Business Development for Sealy & Company. 

The JV is actively pursuing assets and portfolios in major industrial markets with a defined investment size between $5 million and $100 million.

1993,"“ Not invented here ” is never a very nice attitude to come across in business. The idea that something is better just because it has been worked on and tweaked by a company’s own staff is at best arrogant and, at worst, means the company will miss countless opportunities to produce better products or do so more cost effectively. 
 
Bringing in third-party vendors – anything from a single contractor to a team from a big multinational – will bring fresh ideas and often fresh impetus to a project. But there is also risk involved too. 
 
Corporate compliance teams – whose job it is to ensure the business is managing that risk – are typically bought into help evaluate of third-party vendors after they’ve been selected. It’s much better for all concerned if the compliance teams is in on the process from the beginning. 
 
As the global compliance counsel at a global manufacturer in CEB’s compliance membership recently said, “If you’re only getting involved at the last step, when the business has already decided to bring on a third party, you’re managing the process but you’re not managing the risk” (see chart 1). 
 

 
Chart 1: Ability to control risk decreases throughout the procurement process   Risk variability among prospective third parties, illustrative  Source: CEB analysis 
 
That’s why the compliance team takes a role early on in the procurement process. Compliance can exert greater influence when there are more third party options to consider and has a better chance to proactively affect the level of risk the business is willing to accept. 
 Two Ways Compliance Can Help with Choosing the Right Third-Party Vendor  
This approach has helped line managers at the large manufacturer select third parties with the best risk-reward tradeoffs and also help shape demand for compliance services. It has two main components. 
   
Help business partners question their assumptions : First, the compliance team challenges ingrained assumptions that line managers may have about who might be the best external candidates for a particular project (see chart 2). 
 

 
Chart 2: Assumptions line managers make about using third-party vendors  Source: CEB analysis 
 
The compliance team doesn’t add any layers of bureaucracy; it simply asks these questions at its regular meetings with regional business partners. This helps the compliance team gather intelligence about the potential third party relationships required to achieve a given business goal while there is still an opportunity to meaningfully alter the level of risk associated with a project. 
   
Make compliance costs transparent : Second, the compliance team prices out the amount of compliance-related costs associated with a particular third party. While most compliance teams assume that line managers won’t care about this kind of information, providing a more accurate cost-benefit analysis that includes compliance costs will show the value of the expertise that the compliance team can provide. 
 
Once business partners see this, they will become increasingly receptive to any perspectives from the compliance team in future discussions (see chart 3). 
 

 
Chart 3: Adding the compliance-related costs of using third parties  Source: CEB analysis 
   
This two-pronged approach helps line managers select the third-party vendors with the right level of risk and reward, while ensuring their work will support the firm’s business goals.

Conduct your personal assessments and pick the rifle scope which you like, not the one your dad or best friend prefers. They are not the ones that will be shooting over it. In years past, I allowed my buddy talk me into purchasing a lower priced Simmons scope over the more costly Bushnell Elite I wanted.Ultimately, that ended up being a very poor choice on my part as the scope I bought turned out to be very poor when compared to one I genuinely wanted.

Attacking PM Narendra Modi, Rahul Gandhi said that 'Modi had said don't be scared, achche din will come, now farmers are committing suicide.' 

""Farmers are not criticising Modi, but abusing him. ""Modiji is attacking himself,"" the Cong vice-president said. 

Rahul Gandhi also urged his partymen to imbibe the 'team culture' of Steve Jobs' Apple and shun rigid hierarchies like the RSS in its bid to regain lost ground in UP. 

""Party must work like Steve Jobs' Apple and be open to all opinions and not just some leaders. We (Congress) allow people to have different ideologies, unlike the RSS,"" the Congress leader told his party members at a chintan shivir in Mathura. 

Rahul Gandhi is in the Mathura to assess the party's strategy in the state which goes to assembly polls in early 2017. 

""The Congress party is not like the RSS which guides the government. Every member's voice is heard here unlike what happens under (RSS chief) Mohan Bhagwat,"" Gandhi said at the meet, which is the party's first major programme to deliberate on the issue of toning of the outfit after the 2014 Lok Sabha polls that saw Congress securing just two of the total 8",f9770040-3eda-4107-af6a-efb4c64851de,News,2015-09-21T08:37:38Z,MyInforms,"Party must work like Steve Jobs' Apple, Rahul Gandhi tells Congress workers",0.0,News
3617,"The All Blacks will be the most experienced team at this Rugby World Cup in terms of test caps, but Brodie Retallick, a player who seems to have been around for a decade, is, like the majority of the squad, about to attend one for the first time. 

Lock Retallick, World Rugby's player of the year in 2014, has been a fixture in the pack since his debut in 2012 - playing in 41 tests around the world - but he is not sure what to expect over the next two months or so and neither do 17 of his colleagues. 

""The only other real rugby tournament like this that I've been to is the Under-20s in Italy which was half the time of this World Cup, so it's new ground for a lot of the boys and it's something that we're looking forward to,"" he said. 

""Not being there before, I don't really know what to expect and what the atmosphere is going to be like but at the same time it's exciting. We've got four pool matches to get through and hopefully we can move on from there but we've got to play some good rugby."" 

The 24-year-old's partnership with Sam Whitelock, with Luke Romano in reserve, is such that Steve Hansen and his coaches have opted to take only three locks. 

Jerome Kaino and Victor Vito will be used as possible lock cover, their versatility allowing the All Blacks to take an extra loose forward - a traditionally injury-prone position - while allowing for extra speed on the bench. Retallick insisted he was happy with the potential extra workload and his ability to play through pain was probably one of the reasons Hansen decided to take only three specialist second-rowers.

  In our town of staunch gourmands, if there ever was a restaurant serving upscale cuisine at everyday prices, the newly opened Nostra Spaghetteria would most likely put it to shame. Executive Chef/Owner, Alexander Alioto, a fourth generation restaurateur from a renowned San Francisco family, unveiled his new concept of affordable menu of high quality hand-made goodies and thoroughly selected wine, beer, and cocktail lists at his restaurant and bar (Bar Mia) on September 1.     
Growing up in the Italian food-focused family, and then spending years apprenticing in Italy, including at the two-star Michelin Ristorante San Domenico, Chef Alioto used to work in the kitchen at the world-famous French Laundry before opening his first Seven Hills, Zagat’s ""Best Italian Restaurant in the Bay Area,"" and now Nostra Spaghetteria in the Mission District.   Using fresh from the market local and seasonal ingredients, and making everything by hand, from mixing dough and cutting pasta with a knife to cooking a variety of delectable sauces from scratch, the kitchen at Nostra Spaghetteria extends its courtesy to allow for diner’s initiative. While the regular menu features old spaghetti favorites and newly popular dishes, the additional “custom pasta menu” lists nine kinds of handmade pasta, including a gluten-free variety; 10 house-made sauces (like arrabbiata, creamy tomato, white wine & garlic); eight veggie options (mushrooms, English peas, summer squash, etc.) and nine proteins from shrimp to turkey meatballs. If my school math memory serves me right this list of ingredients provides near infinite amount of possibilities for creating your own pasta dishes every day of the year for many-many years! For our first dinner at Nostra (“ours” in Italian) my dining companion and I picked several of the chef-recommended “simple dishes.” Grilled Octopus antipasto with heirloom cannellini beans, cherry tomato, frisee salad, and lemon vinaigrette was beautifully plated and perfectly balanced in tastes and textures. Raviolo al Uovo primo with parmesan cheese, Bloomsdale spinach, homemade ricotta cheese, brown butter, and truffle oil presented a rather substantial and easily shareable mama-dumpling topped with a soft cooked egg and stuffed to the brim with a delicious mixture of silky cheese and chewy greens. Another primo, which I wouldn’t think of ordering, but only because [uninitiated] I didn’t know better, was called Cold Spaghetti, and presented a hockey puck of tangled tender pasta in a pool of fresh heirloom tomato puree (just tomatoes and olive oil), topped with young pea shoots and sprinkled with micro greens. (When I peered into the open kitchen I saw those microgreens and other herbs grown in shallow boxes next to the prep table. Not a bad idea – a kitchen garden right in the kitchen! They can’t get fresher than that…) Then we finished our wonderful cocktails – Monkeys in Manhattan from Amaro Cocktails list, and Strawberry Basil Gimlet from House Cocktails – prepared by the Lead Bar Manager, Adam Mardigras, and the fun began! We asked our server and Sommelier Chevis Scott to recommend some wine for our customized pasta dishes we were about to consume. From a long list of sophisticated international labels compiled by the Master Sommelier Nunzio Alioto, he picked the utterly pleasing Sicilian Planeta, Cerasuolo di Vittoria (Nero d’Avola & Frappato Blend), and suggested we don’t go heavy-handed on creating our own pasta dishes, which was a great advice! I picked thin ribbons of tarjin pasta, substantial veal ragu sauce, and my favorite vegetable – eggplant. My husband picked light and airy gnocchi, basil pesto, and oxtail meat. Both our custom-made pastas turned out to be incredibly delicious, which was easily explained by the utmost freshness and the immediacy of preparation of all ingredients.     When it came time for dessert, we were actually full, but couldn’t resist Chef Alex’s Buttermilk Panna Cotta with Birbet wine gelee, nicely complimented by the sweet Moscato d’Asti from Piedmont. The contemporary “casual chic” design of the dining room and bar includes comfy tables and booths, a large-scale mural from local artist, Chris Lux, a few industrial accents, and bare Edison lamps of various forms and sizes. Reclaimed wood from a torn down barn, spotted in Half Moon Bay by the Chef’s mom, adds to the family feel of this tasteful and friendly place. Nostra Spaghetteria is located at 280 Valencia Street, San Francisco. Dinner 5:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Tuesday – Thursday and Sunday and 5:30 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. Friday and Saturday. Brunch on Sunday 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Bar Mia is open Tuesday – Saturday 3:00 p.m. to midnight and Sunday 3:00 p.m. – 10:00 p.m. with a special happy hour Tuesday – Sunday 3:00 p.m to 7:00 p.m. and late-night 10:00 p.m. – midnight Tuesday - Saturday.

3854,"(BPT) - The role of teachers in today’s society cannot be understated. Outside of a child’s parents, teachers are often the primary adult influencers in a young person’s life. Yet this essential role is getting harder and harder to fill as school districts across the nation face significant teacher shortages according to the U.S. Department of Education. To counteract this critical problem, recruiting new talent to the profession has become a national priority. What shouldn’t be lost in the quest for teachers, however is the intrinsic rewards of influencing and educating young people. The educators of tomorrow must view teaching as a path toward improving lives, not simply as a means to meet the demand. 
  
Morale remains high 
 
The modern teacher shortage can be tied to many things - including a wave of retiring educators and national education funding challenges - but teacher morale does not appear to be an issue. Research shows that 88 percent of teachers are satisfied with their choice to become a teacher, according to a recent University of Phoenix College of Education survey of more than 1,000 K-12 teachers. Additionally, 68 percent of teachers, who entered the field in the past 10 years, say they would recommend the profession to others. Recent federal data supports these findings as well. Eighty-three percent of teachers who entered the field in 2008-2009 were still working in education five years later, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. 
 
Higher education’s role in preparing the next generation of teachers 
 
Efforts to grow the teaching ranks must focus on teacher recruitment, particularly in STEM subjects. Research also shows that expanding access to teacher preparation programs and providing prospective teachers with experience that will help them navigate the critical first few years in the classroom is essential. 
 
Higher education institutions play a vital role in ensuring potential candidates understand the opportunities that exist in education. Today’s teacher preparation programs must be able to accommodate modern student schedules and meet unique education needs. 
 
Teacher preparation programs that offer flexibility and relevance to the dynamics of today’s classrooms are a must for student success. In addition, the curriculum offered by higher education institutions should also provide today’s teacher candidates with real-world scenarios that encourage critical thinking and decision-making skills. These lessons will be vital when managing their own classrooms in the years ahead. 
 
Inspiring tomorrow’s teachers 
 
As most teachers will attest, they did not join the profession to get rich, but rather to inspire children and young adults to learn, set ambitious goals and achieve them. The University of Phoenix survey found that past generations of teachers were quite successful at this. Nearly half of respondents were inspired to join the profession by a teacher they had when they were young, according to the University of Phoenix survey. 
 
Recruiting, retaining and supporting the individuals who are so critical to the future of today’s children, takes a team effort. But the efforts are worth it as the successes of today’s teachers will ultimately translate into the victories of tomorrow’s leaders.",3b32a1a6-00b0-4b2d-8ec2-80ee26683a94,News,2015-08-31T05:00:00Z,Press and Dakotan,Teachers: the resource students need most remains in short supply,0.0,Blog

1658,"HeartWare International, Inc. (Nasdaq: HTWR), a leading innovator of less invasive, miniaturized circulatory support technologies that are revolutionizing the treatment of advanced heart failure, announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Valtech Cardio, Ltd. (""Valtech""). Valtech is a privately held company that specializes in the development of innovative surgical and transcatheter valve repair and replacement devices for the treatment of the most prevalent heart valve diseases - mitral valve regurgitation (MR) and tricuspid valve regurgitation (TR). 

https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150901/262901LOGO https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150901/262902LOGO 

The vast majority of patients with MR and TR also suffer from advanced heart failure, and the progression of heart failure can accelerate considerably as a result of valvular dysfunction. Patients with advanced heart failure who receive a ventricular assist device (VAD), like HeartWare's HVAD® System, commonly undergo a concomitant, therapeutic mitral or tricuspid valve procedure. This transaction provides HeartWare with a highly complementary portfolio of technologies to broaden the treatments it offers heart failure patients and enhance patient outcomes. 

MR is a condition in which the mitral valve leaflets fail to close properly, allowing backflow of blood from the left ventricle into the left atrium during systole. Left untreated, severe MR can eventually lead to a meaningful deterioration in cardiac function and, eventually, death. Approximately 4.2 million patients are affected by mitral valve disease in the U.S., which represents a several-billion-dollar market opportunity. TR is estimated to affect 1.6 million patients in the U.S. and complements the mitral patient population, as a significant percentage of patients suffer from both MR and TR. 

""We have been actively monitoring the mitral space for several years, given the overlap of patient population and referral channel with our VAD business,"" said Doug Godshall, President and CEO of HeartWare. ""We identified Valtech as having the broadest, most compelling portfolio several years ago, which led to an investment in 2013. This investment gave us a unique opportunity to observe Valtech's significant progress across their portfolio of valve repair and replacement technologies. It is from this vantage point that we have concluded that Valtech's platforms represent the most innovative and comprehensive portfolio of interventional and surgical products for mitral and tricuspid repair and replacement in development today. Valtech provides HeartWare with commercial-stage products for mitral repair, as well as a robust technology pipeline, an advanced R&D center and an impressive, experienced team with a proven track record. This combination represents an attractive opportunity for value creation for HeartWare shareholders, customers, employees and patients by expanding HeartWare's footprint in the high-growth structural heart market."" 

Since incorporation in 2005, Valtech has developed an expansive portfolio of innovative technologies for the treatment of mitral and tricuspid valve disease. Highlights of Valtech's product platforms include: 

-- Cardioband® is the first interventional, transfemoral, direct annuloplasty system designed for mitral and tricuspid repair. To date, Cardioband has been used to treat more than 50 patients and is expected to receive CE Mark approval for mitral valve repair in 2015. Following regulatory approval, Cardioband is expected to be commercially launched on a limited basis in Europe in late 2015. A U.S. Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) is planned for submission in 2016. The first human procedures using the Cardioband system, modified for the treatment of tricuspid valve disease, are anticipated in late 2016. 

-- Cardinal(TM) is a differentiated, semi-rigid, adjustable annuloplasty ring system that provides surgeons with the ability to optimize annuloplasty results by enabling fine-tuning of the ring diameter and leaflet coaptation on a beating heart under real-time echocardiographic guidance. To date, Cardinal has been used to treat more than 75 patients globally. Already CE Mark-approved for mitral repair, production scaling will drive an anticipated commercial launch in 2016 for mitral repair, followed by tricuspid repair in 2017. 

-- CardioValve(TM) is a transseptally delivered, low-profile, transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) system with five degrees of steering maneuverability. The CardioValve platform has an orientation-indifferent structure for reduced implant complexity, was designed from inception to enable transseptal delivery, and can also be delivered transapically. CardioValve is currently being tested in chronic animal studies and is anticipated for human clinical studies in early 2017. 

-- V-Chordal® is a surgical and interventional chord replacement system for MR repair. V-Chordal, which has been successfully evaluated in a first-in-man clinical trial, is expected to expand the range of percutaneous solutions offered for treating degenerative mitral valve pathologies and allow more patients to be treated without the risk of open-heart surgery. The timing for a CE Mark study is being evaluated in relation to the commencement of multiple other Valtech trials. 

""Valtech's robust portfolio of repair and replacement technologies provides us with the most comprehensive product suite to treat the mitral and tricuspid populations. We believe it will be critical to offer patients and physicians a multifaceted approach in the treatment of MR and TR, with both repair and replacement options,"" added Mr. Godshall. ""The mitral repair market is already a well-established and rapidly growing market with a significant, unmet, immediate clinical need. The Cardioband transfemoral annuloplasty system represents a more reproducible and predictable platform for mitral valve repair than existing solutions. We believe Cardioband will be a natural and clear selection as a first-line treatment for the broadest spectrum of MR patients, since it offers a safer option and, even in early clinical use, has already demonstrated a strong efficacy profile."" 

""Valtech has benefited significantly from HeartWare's early investment in our company. Since then, we have developed a strong relationship based on a shared mission to deliver transformative products to patients with advanced heart failure and degenerative heart conditions,"" said Amir Gross, Founder and CEO of Valtech. ""By joining HeartWare, we can more quickly and fully realize the potential of our pipeline technologies and further influence the underpenetrated markets that we serve. HeartWare's existing market development experience and commercial infrastructure provide a compelling platform from which to launch multiple products worldwide, including a near-term launch of Cardioband in international markets following anticipated CE Mark approval this year. Together, we can offer clinical heart failure teams a compelling portfolio of surgical and interventional technologies to serve the advanced heart failure population."" 

Strategic and Financial Benefits of the Transaction 

-- Significant Market Expansion Opportunity - By expanding its footprint into the high-growth structural heart market, HeartWare establishes itself as one of the most broadly equipped leaders in the treatment of patients with advanced heart failure. This acquisition provides HeartWare with multiple, innovative, new, commercial opportunities in the significantly underserved areas of mitral and tricuspid valve diseases, from which many VAD patients today also suffer. 

-- Comprehensive Technology Portfolio - Valtech's pipeline offers a comprehensive product portfolio of progressive technologies across four platforms, including two near-term commercial-stage products. The acquisition accelerates and expands HeartWare's ability to deliver transformative technologies to patients and customers with a range of innovative VAD and valve therapies, leveraging the clinical overlap of the heart teams performing these procedures. 

-- Commitment to Improving Patient Outcomes - Valtech has developed repair and replacement technologies that can be delivered via the transseptal approach, which offers a safer, less-invasive delivery method for patients. Valtech's product platforms align with HeartWare's strategic objective of delivering transformative, less-invasive therapies for patients with chronic heart failure. 

-- Innovative and Experienced Team - The strength of HeartWare's existing leadership team and commercial, manufacturing and development organizations, coupled with Valtech's experienced and inventive R&D team, creates a world-class organization of experts well-suited to develop and commercialize breakthrough technologies for advanced heart failure patients. HeartWare plans to lead the commercialization of the Valtech product portfolio, while maintaining Valtech as a separate business unit. 

-- Enhanced Platform for Growth - The combined portfolio provides HeartWare with leading technologies in two of the highest-growth markets in heart failure today. We believe this portfolio positions HeartWare to deliver accelerated revenue growth and attractive shareholder returns over time. 

Terms of the AgreementAccording to the terms of the agreement, Valtech shareholders will receive an up-front consideration of 4.4 million shares of HeartWare common stock; 800,000 shares of HeartWare common stock, contingent upon CE Mark approval for Cardioband; and 700,000 shares of HeartWare common stock upon the earlier of first-in-man implants for either Cardioband tricuspid or CardioValve. The transaction also includes warrants to purchase 850,000 shares of HeartWare common stock at an exercise price of $83.73 per share (based on a volume weighted average price of HeartWare shares) exercisable upon attainment of $75 million in net sales (trailing 12 months) of Valtech products, and an earn-out payment of $375 million (payable in cash or stock, at the discretion of HeartWare), upon attainment of $450 million of net sales (trailing 12 months) of Valtech products. 

This transaction was approved by the Boards of Directors of HeartWare and Valtech, with holders of more than 70% of Valtech's shares having signed support agreements committing to the transaction. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals, as well as HeartWare stockholder and Valtech shareholder approvals. The closing of the transaction is expected in late 2015. 

Perella Weinberg Partners is acting as financial advisor to HeartWare, and Canaccord Genuity Inc. provided a fairness opinion to the Board of Directors of HeartWare in connection with the transaction.

1610," Las Vegas, NV (KTNV) -- It's what fans of Uber and Lyft have been waiting for, both ride sharing services are officially up and running in Las Vegas. But it's not without its controversy, the rides are being offered without the blessing of Clark County Commissioners. 
 
An Action News crew decided to take both and Uber and Lyft rides to see how they are operating and how drivers feel about everything that's happened. 
 
It started with the push of a button and within seven minutes our crew had a Lyft from Robert Archer. 
 
""I was fiddling with my phone and the app came up, a ride that was on Gilespie, so I just punched it in and away we went,"" said Archer about how he officially learned that he could start offering rides. 
 
Our crew was his second ride. Earlier in the day officials from both Uber and Lyft went in front of the Clark County Commission to request temporary business licenses but were denied. Just hours later both services decide to start operating anyway with their state licenses.  
 
""When they make up their mind then fine and dandy, I'll go get a county license, if that's what it takes, I've got a state license now to operate,"" said Archer. 
 
Robert dropped our crew off at Charlie Frias Park where we asked people if they are comfortable with taking an Uber or Lyft ride, eventhough they don't have a county business licese. 
 
""Yes I would, yes I would, it's a big help,"" said Las Vegas resident Ioianna Athalone. 
 
""Yes I would because it's an easy way to get around especially if you don't have a car,"" said Bernard Matis. 
 
And to get back our crew used Uber. After just five minutes, Joshua Kaufman, our Uber driver arrived. Like Archer, he's happy the services are finally up and running. 
 
""Even beyond the price, it's simply because it's a clean car, you get friendly service in general and there are all these things that make it a better deal,"" said Kaufman. 
 
Both companies were licensed by the state on Monday and in a statement Uber said it's complying with all existing rules.",53826a7e-4a0d-4869-9191-eb858b6214c3,News,2015-09-16T06:33:00Z,KTNV,"Uber, Lyft officially operating in Las Vegas",0.0,Blog

DETROIT (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is considering a health care co-op proposed by the United Auto Workers to cut rising costs.

1689,"LAS VEGAS -- Two people were killed and four others were injured after a fire tore through a minibus after a collision in Las Vegas. 
 
Later, Jonathan Donner, 24, of Las Vegas was charged with two counts of DUI resulting in death and three counts of DUI resulting in substantial bodily harm, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police said in a statement. 
 
Fire officials said the wreck happened around 7 a.m. Saturday near South Main Street and Charleston Boulevard. 
 
A BMW driven by Donner sped through a red light at the intersection and hit the minibus, causing it to overturn, police said. 
 
Several firefighters quickly extinguished the fire, but the bus was a total loss. 
 
The people who were killed were a 53-year-old man from Las Vegas and a 34-year-old man from Germany, said police, who withheld their names pending notification of family.

2348,"Newsquest’s Young Reporter scheme is beginning its eighth year, offering students from around the capital the chance to publish their own news stories on to websites visited by thousands daily. 
 
In addition, as well as appearing on all our area-specific websites, the stories will be hosted on thisislocallondon.co.uk, covering every corner of our great city. 
 
Designed to encourage aspiring writers and journalists to think independently, explore and enquire about the world around them and build their confidence, the scheme is open to all schools and colleges in London for pupils aged between 14 and 18. 
 
 
 
 Award winners Katie Harris and Nicola Evans at Newsquest South London offices in Sutton  
 
Students start their “writing career” producing one article a month for a period of eight months and the scheme is carefully structured so that they feel they are working directly for the online newspaper. 
 
They are given deadlines to work to and encouraged to write local articles, take photographs and then upload their work directly to our website. 
 
Judith Forshaw, head of English at Croydon High School, said: “The Young Reporter scheme continues to give our students a unique opportunity to see their articles published for a real audience.” 
   Promoted stories   
At the end of the programme, the students who have completed eight articles receive a letter of recognition from a Newsquest editor, congratulating them on their achievement. 
 
Those who write their articles within the deadlines are given the opportunity to compete against other students to win prizes and spend a day at a London university. 
 
Kingston University hosted the event this year.

Schools have wholeheartedly endorsed this scheme as it is hard to secure work experience placements in the media and Newsquest organises the entire project, so it can be run with minimal effort from teachers. 
 
Kathryn Pullen, headteacher, Sydenham High School, said: “This is our first year in the scheme and it has been a pleasure to see our girls rising to the challenge and publishing some excellent articles.

3352,"NEW YORK, Sept. 22, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The wearables technology is evolving: better data gathering, better reliability, better navigation, better ability, better analytics to turn data into information are provided. Wearables are useful for measuring the effect of different activities on performance. Devices are useful for measuring different levels of personal effort, swing a bat, running a mile, carrying a football, enduring a hit to the head. Affordable, useful wrist wearables are available with a increasing number of data collection functions. The study has 565 pages and 228 tables and figures. 

In sports and fitness technology, it is not about what data can be shown, it is how meaningful the data is in terms of improving athletic performance or managing overall personal fitness. Wearables have become fitness and sports personal devices. They bring big data, enough data that it can be turned into actionable information. Devices are being used by athletes and coaches to make team members better players. Fitness devices are being used to increase the levels and qualities of exercise. Whether it is an UP band or Zepp, vendors have been forced to realize that people need interpretation of data, they need to know the meaning of data collected by the wearable. Wearable technology is poised to affect the way any game is played by professionals, shifting sports more than anything has ever done before. Sports and smart technology are poised to give teams that are early adopters significant competitive advantage. Professional sports teams and professional athletes are early adopters of wearable sensors, driving market growth. The professional athletes have the money to spend of development products. They have the most to gain from athletic performance improvements. Within the wearables industry, there seems to be a big market for professional athletes who need that edge over their competitors to stay in the game. 

Sports wearables consist of sensors, tracking devices, and software apps that implement sports analytics Sports Analytics: Performance Devices, Watches, Sensors, And Wearable Apparel Technology Brings Wearable Technology for Sports. This Revolutionizes Athlete Performance Analysis Leading To Training and On Field Play Improvement And Presages Changes In Team Composition. Performance watches, sensors, and wearable apparel technology are bringing massive changes in sports, changes in how the game is played, how the the teams and athletes are managed. Wearable Technology for sports revolutionizes athlete performance analysis and ultimately brings on field play improvement. Recreational fitness consumers and corporate wellness programs are also target markets. Wearable technology and analytical software revolutionize sports and fitness training, implementing performance improvement and injury prevention. Sports analytics: is evolving beyond on field ply analysis to biometrics analysis. The ability to analyze joint, muscle, heart, respiratory, cadence, and endurance parameters of the athlete or ordinary user is significant. In addition, the swing of the bat or the racket can be analyzed. 

According to Susan Eustis, leader of the team that prepared the study, ""Wearables represent a multi-billion dollar industry. Within the wearables sports and fitness analytics industry, growth comes from professional athletes and teams that need to achieve an edge over their competitors and from consumers wishing to gain performance advantage in their routines by imitating what the professionals do. Performance can be improved, coaching can be improved using wearable tracking devices.""

1603,"Costa Coffee has warned that prices could be forced up because of the introduction of the national living wage next… NICK GOODWAY 

Tuesday 8 September 2015 12:18 BST 

Bean counting: Whitbread says price increases and efficiency measures will be implemented to offset the living wage costs Phil Noble/Reuters 

Costa Coffee has warned that prices could be forced up because of the introduction of the national living wage next year. 

Andy Harrison, chief executive of the company, which also owns Premier Inn, said there would be “selective price increases” among other measures to deal with the extra £15 million to £20 million that he expects the living wage to cost his business. 

“I cannot rule out price increases,” said Harrison. “People are our biggest single cost. 

“We are supportive of a steady increase in the national living wage, but this is quite a big one which came out of the blue in the summer Budget. 

” 

He added that the group had not yet decided which prices might be raised and would reveal details with its first-half results next month. 

Out of Whitbread’s total hourly paid staff of 42,000, around 34,000 are currently paid £7.20 or less — and of those 16,000 are over 25 and so will qualify for the living wage. 

The company also owns the Beefeater, Brewers Fayre, Table Table and Taybarns restaurant chains. 

Harrison said: “We shall mitigate this substantial price increase over time with a combination of productivity improvements boosted by investments in systems and training and efficiency improvements. 

“At least it is much easier to absorb something like this in a fast-growing business which is set to create around 3,000 jobs this year. 

” 

But he highlighted the knock-on effect of the national living wage, saying: “We are also looking at our differentials — because if the minimum wa…",50b10ad9-38b6-4a37-9cd4-7eb14db4e3e6,News,2015-09-08T11:23:16Z,MyInforms,Whitbread says living wage will force up prices at Costa Coffee,0.0,Blog
4640,"Have bottles and cans? We'll gladly take them off your hands!

Yes, families at EGC are collecting bottles and cans as a way to raise funds for the REACH project. Check out our progress meter to the left—we're just over half our fundraising goal!

Designated drop-off containers can be found in the Grade School classroom at our Lima campus. For questions, please contact Emily Seymour at emilyseymour@elimgospel.org.



Take a look below to see what our Kids Ministry is teaching this week!

In the Lima Campus 34's classroom: I Can Obey—Solomon Obeys

Talk About It: God knew Solomon would obey, so He gave him a very important job. When we obey, our leaders will trust us to obey with even bigger things.

Bible Connection: ""You will be blessed if you obey the commands of the Lord your God…"" Deuteronomy 11:27 

Challenge for families: Get out some building blocks or a Lego set. Build a house together. Talk about house Solomon built a house for God. Think together about what a house for God might be like. Tell your child that God is with you right now, and that He can come and make His home in our hearts. 



In the Lima Campus 5K's classroom and the Henrietta Campus Preschool classroom: Jesus Shows Me How to Live—The Lost Coin

Talk About It: Jesus told a story about a woman who searched for a lost coin. His story shows us that we should tell those who don’t know Jesus all about God’s love. 

Bible Connection: “Follow My teachings and learn from Me...” Matthew 11:29

Challenge for families: Whenever you find some loose change, remind your child that just like this change, Jesus is always looking for those who don’t know Him.



In the Grade School classrooms: God's House—Wrap-Up

This week's main point: God is speaking to all of us about our relationship with Him. What's He saying to you?

Main verse: Luke 14:15-24 (The Parable of the Great Banquet)

Challenge for Kids: Take time to listen to God this week about your relationship with Him, and then take action on what He says!",e62b92f1-8d1b-42fb-a995-73b9432c6806,Blog,2015-09-19T14:00:46Z,EGC Kids,From Pastor Greg's Desk,1.0,Blog

4186,"Preservation versus conservation? To protect or to use wisely? Wilderness versus the nature in our own backyards? Dichotomies such as these demonstrate the often confused and polarizing relationships that humans have with nature. Throw in the words “business” or “profit” and you might just start an intellectual, if not an actual fist fight. So just how are businesses supposed to sincerely embrace the “green” revolution, while simultaneously striving to increase profitability? Before we tackle that conundrum of a question, let’s first take a brief look at how humans think about nature. 
 
In the most basic sense, we often fall into one of two camps (although we often wander between them): One camp says that we have to preserve nature for its own sake – that the “value” in nature is intrinsic to itself, and that we tend to just destroy nature for our own selfish reasons. In this scenario nature is something to be fenced-off and protected from the onslaught of human greed. The other camp says no way, “tear down the fences,” nature is there for our use. Proponents of this conservation ideology say we should use natural resources carefully and wisely, but use them we must. In our increasingly polarized culture, even suggesting that there’s wisdom on both sides of the divide can be a tough sell. 
 
Where does this leave businesses? Are the ideas of profitability and sustainability even compatible? Can a business exist in a kind of environmental demilitarized zone, where they unashamedly pursue profit, while in a real, tangible way seek to differentiate themselves as environmental stewards? At Taylor Studios we’ve embraced “green materials” throughout the processes of museum exhibit design and fabrication. 
 
As the wood shop lead at Taylor Studios, I’m responsible for sourcing all the materials that come through our department. What are some examples of green materials that we use? Here are just a few: 
  Water-based contact adhesives: non-flammable and they don’t stink!  Water-based lacquers: no fire-related worries in the spray room, and they actually dry quicker than many solvent-based products.  “GreenGuard” certified traditional lacquers: While still being solvent-based, they have much less VOC content (volatile organic compounds) than traditional finishes.  Formaldehyde-free plywood & panel products: non-toxic adhesives eliminate off-gassing problems, and make an extremely strong bond.  Ultra-light panel products: also formaldehyde-free, with the benefit of being almost half the weight of traditional board.  FSC Certified (Forest Stewardship Council) hardwoods and plywood products from sustainably grown plantations.  Reconstituted Wood Veneers: several companies produce high-quality veneers from the waste products of traditional manufacturing. They look beautiful and perform very well in the real world.   
The key to enticing more companies to embrace “green” materials is to make those materials more available, higher in quality, and more competitively priced than their traditional counterparts. We’re seeing that happen at an accelerating pace. Over just the past five years green materials have improved to the point that operating with status quo, old-school materials is often simply a bad business idea. I think the next 5 years will bring even more innovation and green-profit potential.

Addressing a U.N. meeting on sustainable development, Obama said that the world has made progress on reducing hunger, improving the treatment of disease, and lifting people out of poverty, but challenges remain. 

""Our work is nowhere near done,"" Obama told delegates who gathered for the annual opening of the U.N. General Assembly. 

Development programs are working, Obama said, but results can improve if the U.S. and other countries can address such issues as bad governance; gender, racial, and income inequality; fulfilling the economic potential of Africa; and the ravages of wars. 

Obama also cited the global challenge he plans to emphasize throughout his U.N. meetings: climate change. ""All of our countries will be affected by a changing climate,"" Obama said, especially poorer nations. 

As Obama flew to New York City aboard Air Force One early Sunday, the White House announced an addition to his U.N. schedule: the Tuesday meeting with Castro, Obama's second face-to-face with the communist leader since the U.S. and Cuba restored diplomatic relations in late 2014. 

They met in April on the sidelines of a Summit of Americas meeting in Panama. The two also spoke by phone earlier this month, before the visit of Pope Francis to both Cuba and the United States. 

This is Castro's first trip to the annual opening of the U.N. General Assembly. 

After speaking at a mid-afternoon meeting on the U.N.'s global development agenda, Obama visited the U.S. mission to the United Nations to meet with employees and their families. 

Obama turns to domestic politics Sunday evening as he delivers remarks at a Democratic National Committee LGBT gala. 

In addition to his annual address to the countries that make up the U.N. General Assembly — something Obama will do Monday morning — United Nations week gives the president a chance to meet one-on-one with a select group of other world leaders. 

In addition to Castro, Obama's meeting list this year includes India Prime Minister Narendra Modi, President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, and a potentially tense session with Russia President Vladimir Putin. 

Topics for the Putin meeting include U.S. objections to what it calls Russian aggression in Ukraine and concern about a Russian military build-up in Syria. 

""Our support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine will be front and center throughout our discussions,"" said Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser for strategic communications. 

U.S. officials have also criticized Russian support for embattled Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. 

Putin, who authorized a Russian annexation of the Ukraine area, says he will protect the interests of ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine, and still objects to what he has called a 2014 ""coup"" of a pro-Russian leader in Ukraine. 

As for Syria, Putin says he wants to help fight the Islamic State, and he criticized the U.S. for backing Syrian rebels seeking to topple Assad. 

The American ""provision of military support to illegal structures runs counter to the principles of modern international law and the United Nations charter,"" Putin said on CBS' 60 Minutes. 

The White House also said Sunday that, during his Air Force One flight, Obama spoke by phone with Chilean President  Michelle Bachelet. 

In addition to discussing the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, Obama also offered Bachelet condolences for a Sept. 16 earthquake in Chile ""and inquired about the status of rebuilding and recovery efforts.""

2678,"A brilliant selection posted by Ken Myers on Mars Hill Audio's website:
“Teaching a language is the model for all other education. To educate means to introduce a person into one’s own world, to interpret the world, to train a person to make distinctions, whether it be the distinction between a blackbird and a robin, between a brook and a canal, and between a Mercedes and a Volkswagen, or on the other hand the distinction between the important and the trivial, between the beautiful and the ugly, and between good and evil.
“The distinctions just mentioned are not ones we can learn in a merely theoretical way. We learn to distinguish between the important and the trivial only through the practice of acts of preference, deferral, and renunciation. We learn to distinguish between ‘beautiful’ and ‘ugly’ by growing out of the crude judgments that ‘I like that’ and ‘I don’t like that,’ and by fashioning in ourselves an organ for the perception of objective qualities. But this happens in the first place through an encounter with beauty, through involvement with the beautiful, and through learning to do whatever one does in a beautiful manner. The distinction between good and evil, however, is something we acquire only by learning to take one side and to be against the other — and perhaps in certain circumstances even to be against ourselves; we acquire it by learning that the world is a battlefield between good and evil and that this battle goes on even in our own heart. . . .
“[M]any think that . . . we ought simply to expose young people ‘non-judgmentally’ to various possible worldviews. An exposure of this sort is supposed to be what first teaches a person the attitude of general tolerance, and for the rest, when a person cannot avoid making a choice, it teaches the ability to make a free decision. As if it were possible to choose something that one never got to know from the inside!
“This way of looking at things is a profound and fateful anthropological and pedagogical error. If a person believes that there are many different paths man could take to reach his goal, he does not infer the resolution to follow one of them in a faithful way. Instead, he draws the inference that there is no need to follow any particular path, and he leaves them all as hypothetical. The pathological inability to make a commitment that afflicts many young adults today is already the product of such an approach to education. We prevent young people from experiencing the power that a demanding view of the world and man has to open up reality, merely because we want to give them the possibility of looking at reality from some other perspective. This is a great injustice to children.”
—from Robert Spaemann, “Education as an Introduction to Reality,"" Humanum: Issues in Family, Culture & Science (2015, no. 1)",07a94c7a-1d0b-4664-b28c-1ee358e559c2,Blog,2015-09-28T16:30:04Z,only the curious have something to find,"Robert Spaemann on why education can't be ""objective""",1.0,News

272,"WhereScape ,
a provider of automation software for modeling, building and extending
data warehouses and analytic systems, announced today that Canadian
National Railways and Union Bank will present WhereScape automation use
cases next week at TDWI
San Diego . 

On Tuesday, Sept. 22, Alain Bond, business intelligence manager for
Canadian National Railways, will present Canadian
National Railways Rides Automation to Better Customer Service and Safety at the TDWI Executive Summit. According to Bond, in every organization,
there is some degree of shadow IT within business units that are driven
to deliver point solutions faster than IT typically delivers. Bond is
leading a group at Canadian Railway that is using WhereScape RED,
WhereScape’s flagship automation software for iterative rapid
prototyping within its agile methodology and will discuss how this
“alternate development path” is expediting “game-changing” development
at Canadian Railway. 

According to Bond, this path “should not be a slow and procedural
process requiring tons of upfront documents and analysis before even
showing any glimpse of value to our end users.” Canadian Railway’s
successes using WhereScape RED have been so great that Bond has
proclaimed that “ETL development as we know it is dead.” Even more
significant is the fact that more timely access to data will enable
Canadian Railway to further improve customer service and safety. 

On Thursday, Sept. 24, Ryan Fenner, vice president of enterprise
architecture for Union Bank, will present how WhereScape RED is enabling
his organization to tailor analytics implementations to their individual
needs in his case study entitled, Data
Analytics Federation vs. Centralization: When and Where It Makes Sense .
Union Bank is presently formulating a plan to centralize key analytics
teams, technologies, and processes. Fenner’s compelling use case will
walk attendees through Union Bank’s journey and the guidelines used to
make decisions on where and when to centralize these functions, and to
what extent. Union Bank uses WhereScape RED in its Greenplum and
Microsoft SQL Server enterprise data warehouse and shadow IT
environments. 

 Build a Data Warehouse in Two Hours with WhereScape RED  

WhereScape will host a TDWI Hands-On Lab on Wednesday, Sept. 23
entitled, Data
Warehouse Automation: Build a Fully Functional, Documented Data
Warehouse in 2 Hours! Whether a development team is building its
first enterprise data warehouse, business-targeted data marts, a tier of
reporting services, or the renovation or migration of an existing
warehouse or mart, WhereScape RED provides a compelling automation
alternative to complex and expensive do-it-yourself development
environments. 

According to TDWI, building a data warehouse is among the most
labor-intensive and time-consuming activities of BI development. There
are so many moving parts—requirements, source data analysis,
source-target mapping, data acquisition, data transformation logic, ETL
design, database loading, scheduling, error handling—and getting it
right the first time isn’t easy. When organizations finally do get it
right, something changes. 
 
“Attendees of this fast-paced, hands-on lab will learn first-hand how to
greatly accelerate data warehouse and analytic platform development and
change cycles while simultaneously assuring quality and consistency,”
said WhereScape President Mark Budzinski. “The productivity improvements
of up to 10x afforded by WhereScape RED enables organizations to deliver
accurate data to the business faster than ever thought possible.” 

 About WhereScape  

WhereScape designs, develops, sells and supports WhereScape
3D , the industry’s first data warehouse discovery tool; and WhereScape
RED , the industry’s leading integrated development environment for
building, deploying, managing and renovating data warehouses and
analytic systems. WhereScape’s products are used in every kind of
today’s commercial environment: from normal-form enterprise data
warehouses and data vaults, through user access layers and tiers of
dependent data marts, to standalone data marts and reporting systems. 

More than 700 customers are active and satisfied users of our
technologies, and report that with WhereScape’s products they are able
to build data warehouses with fewer people, few if any diversions,
missed deadlines or unmet user expectations, and in record time: in days

1695,"PITTSBURGH – The Chicago Cubs beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 9-6 on Thursday afternoon. Here’s a quick look at the game. 

How it happened: After giving up a 3-0 lead to trail 4-3, the Cubs scored six runs before making an out in the top of the fifth inning. Anthony Rizzo homered for the 30th time this season, putting the Cubs back in front 5-4, but they didn’t stop there. Addison Russell and Tommy La Stella singled home runs, while reliever Clayton Richard doubled home two more. 

The Cubs took a 1-0 lead in the first as a double-play grounder by Rizzo brought home Dexter Fowler . But three Pirate home runs off Cubs starter Kyle Hendricks changed the tone of the game until that fifth inning. Hendricks was pulled after just three innings while giving up six hits and four runs. Richard pitched 3 1/3 innings, giving up two runs in his final inning of work. 

What it means: The last two days could give immense meaning to games in October. The Cubs showed the ability to come back from different kinds of adversity. On Thursday, their starter got rocked after being handed a 3-0 lead but the offense didn’t go to sleep -- they picked up their pitcher in emphatic fashion. And so did Richard who lasted into a fourth inning of relief before tiring. Joe Maddon likes him in his current bullpen role but once again there could be more value with him in the rotation for a spot start. Hendricks and Dan Haren aren’t performing up to capabilities right now as the former simply got behind in the count and/or left pitches up in the strike zone. His 4.22 ERA is a good description of his season. With the Cubs magic number at nine and 16 games remaining, it’s not like they need a whole bunch of gems from the back-end of their rotation, but one or two nice outings wouldn’t hurt. Plus, they need to get someone ready for the playoffs. 

“Statement” games might sound like a cliché but the Cubs made at least one to themselves if they have to return here in October for a wild card game. Their offense and even bullpen -- along with the right starter -- can be a scary proposition for the opponent. They drew to within two games of the Pirates as Pittsburgh heads to California to face Zack Greinke and Clayton Kershaw . The first wild card spot in the National League is now in their sights after a huge series win. 

Rizzo 30 HR’s: Rizzo is just the second Cubs lefty hitter ever to produce multiple 30 home run seasons as he’s done it two years in a row. Billy Williams did it five times between 1964-1972. 

What’s next: The Cubs return home to open a 3-game series on Friday against the St. Louis Cardinals with Dan Haren (9-9, 3.87) taking on Lance Lynn (11-10, 3.17).",5b5a578f-1d67-489f-adb0-fe952896046a,News,2015-09-17T20:31:49Z,ESPN.com,"Rapid Reaction: Cubs 9, Pirates 6",0.0,News

1881,"The Queen will soon make history when she becomes the longest reigning British monarch - but on the day it will be business as usual for the head of state and her family. 

On Wednesday, she will pass the record set by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria who, Buckingham Palace has calculated, reigned for 23,226 days, 16 hours and 23 minutes. 

There has been speculation a celebratory private event is planned but it is understood that in keeping with the Queen's business-as-usual approach it will be a normal working day for the monarch with no special dinner party. 
 
At this time of year the Queen is taking her traditional summer break at her private Scottish home of Balmoral. 
 
But on the day she passes Victoria's milestone, the monarch, joined by the Duke of Edinburgh, will open the new Scottish Borders Railway and take a steam train ride on the new £294 million railway. 
 
Members of the Royal Family including the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall will also be working. 
 
Charles will be filming a documentary with TV presenters Ant and Dec, believed to be about his Prince's Trust organisation which celebrates its 40th anniversary next year, while Camilla will visit the ITV studios in London to celebrate the organisation's 60th anniversary. 
 
A royal source said: ""You need to remember for the Queen this is a date whose calculation rests on the death of her father and great-great-grandmother, that naturally colours the way she sees it. 
 
""While she acknowledges it as an historic moment, it's also for her not a moment she would personally celebrate, which is why she has been keen to convey business as usual, and no fuss."" 
   Promoted stories   
Historian Dr Kate Williams described the length of the Queen's reign as a great source of strength for the monarch. 
 
""It's a very significant milestone. The Queen will become the longest reigning British monarch in history. She came to the throne when she was older than Victoria. Victoria was only 18,"" Dr Williams said. 
 
""It shows that our female monarchs last the longest. The Queen's longevity is a great source of her strength and popularity. She has lived through World War Two and throughout the 20th century. Many people will not have known a different monarch."" 
 
Queen Victoria, who died in 1901, acceded to the throne on June 20 1837 and became the figurehead of a vast empire amid great industrial, cultural and scientific changes to society. 
 
But she mourned the early death of her consort Prince Albert in 1861 for the rest of her life. 
 
Princess Elizabeth became Queen Elizabeth II when she was 25 on the death of her father King George VI on February 6 1952. Like Victoria, she has acted as a figure of continuity as the country has modernised. 
 
She has served, with Philip at her side, through the 20th century and into the 21st century, witnessing technological advances and a succession of British governments of different political persuasions. 
 
The Queen has become accustomed to countless milestones during her decades on the throne. 
 
In December 2007, she became the longest living British monarch, overtaking Victoria who died when she was 81, and in May 2011 she became the second-longest reigning monarch in British history when she overtook George III. 
 
According to Guinness World Records, the Queen also holds the world record for most currencies featuring the same individual. 
 
The Queen is also the first British monarch to have sent an email, to have a message put on the moon, have conducted a royal ''walkabout'' and to have held a public concert in her back garden. 
 
She is the second-longest serving monarch in the world after King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand, who took to the throne in 1946 but who is now rarely seen in public. 
   
 Share article  
   
The record of length of time on the throne can be calculated in different ways, but the Palace considers the total number of days plus hours and minutes to be the most accurate. 
 
The Queen passes Victoria's record at around 5.30pm on Wednesday when she will have reigned for 23,226 days 16 hours and approximately 30 minutes - but the exact moment she became Queen is hard to calculate as George VI died in his sleep in the early hours of the morning, possibly at around 1am.",ecec4d75-d3ac-447d-ad39-f3132d7dd861,News,2015-09-06T02:26:44Z,Northern Echo,Queen to become longest reigning monarch with business-as-usual approach,0.0,News

2397,"Many are yet to hit public streets Google is expanding its self-driving car fleet quickly: in the last four months the number of cars it is permitted to drive on California streets has more than tripled.

As of Monday, Google has licenses for 73 self-driving vehicles, up from 23 cars in mid May, according to records from California’s Department of Motor Vehicles. Under state law, companies wishing to test autonomous vehicle technology on public roads need a permit for each vehicle from the DMV.

All of the expansion of Google's fleet is for its latest model, a small, rounded car with a distinctive LIDAR laser imaging sensor on its roof and a top speed of 25 miles per hour.

Google has licenses for 50 of the vehicles although only a handful are currently on public roads. They can be seen driving close to the offices of Google X in Mountain View. 

A Google self-driving navigates streets near the company's headquarters in Mountain View, California, on June 29, 2015.

The remainder of Google's self-driving car fleet consists of previous generation Lexus RX450h SUVs.

These look a good deal more industrial with sensors bolted to the sides and front of the car and a similar laser imaging system on the roof.

A Google self-driving navigates streets near the company's headquarters in Mountain View, California, on June 29, 2015.

Together, the Google driverless cars were averaging about 10,000 miles per week on public roads as of early September, according to the company.

To date, Google has reported a handful of accidents and incidents involving the cars, but none have been attributed to the software. In all reported cases, accidents were either due to other drivers or happened when the car was under manual control, the company says.

With the latest Google fleet expansion, there are now 102 autonomous vehicles licensed to take to the streets in California.

Tesla's Model S on the road in Palo Alto, California

3086,"_ BERKELEY -- A medical marijuana dispensary operator has sued the city and three other dispensaries in federal and state court, alleging the defendants created an illegal monopoly that shut out competitors and drove up costs for patients.

In the federal suit filed earlier this month in U.S. District Court, Chris Smith, principal in Forty Acres Medical Marijuana Growers Collective, also accuses the defendants of racketeering, in asking the court to put an end to the city's ""flagrantly unlawful actions to establish and enable the unlawful monopolization of the sale of medical marijuana in Berkeley by a few individuals operating in blatant violation of California law."" 

Smith also alleges that the other three dispensaries violated what was California's prohibition on for-profit medical marijuana organizations.

The three dispensaries cited in the suits are Berkeley Patients Group; Berkeley Patients Care Collective; and Cannabis Buyers Club of Berkeley. Also cited as co-defendants are the Berkeley City Council and the city's Medical Cannabis Commission.

City Attorney Zach Cowan, without elaborating, said in an email, ""All (the suits) are without merits, and we will be moving to dismiss them all.""

A call to Cannabis Buyers Club was referred to another person, who said ""no comment."" A call to Berkeley Patients Group was referred to the marketing director, who did not return a voice-mail message. A person posted outside Berkeley Patients Care's premises suggested contacting the management by phone, but a voice-mail message was not returned.Advertisement Forty Acres had operated for several years at 1820-1828 San Pablo Ave. until the city ordered it shut earlier this year after declaring it a public nuisance. Several years earlier, the city had ordered Forty Acres to cease operations because the city already had the maximum number of dispensaries, three, allowed under city rules at the time.

The citywide cap on dispensaries has since been raised to four, and on Tuesday the City Council will receive a report on the selection process and conduct a review.

Forty Acres was one of the applicants earlier in the current selection process but was rejected, according to a city staff report.

Meanwhile, Forty Acres had reopened on Ashby Avenue, but as of Friday it was not open for business, the result, Smith said, of a preliminary injunction obtained by the city.

""I don't know why they put so much effort into closing a club if they call themselves a sanctuary city for medical cannabis,"" Smith said.

He said Forty Acres is ""being targeted for cultural differences,"" a theme also raised by defenders of Forty Acres in January, when the City Council ordered the San Pablo Avenue venue shut down, voting 7-2, with Councilmen Max Anderson and Kriss Worthington dissenting.

Several detractors had told the council they found Forty Acres' clientele intimidating, while supporters noted that Forty Acres' clients are mostly black, and the neighborhood is undergoing gentrification.

3837,"A freight train killed an Eritrean man in the French part of the Eurotunnel on Wednesday, authorities said, as Europe struggles with its largest migration since the end of World War II. 
 
""Around 1 a.m., a 20-year-old migrant of Eritrean origin was hit by a freight train at the maintenance terminal in the French part of the Eurotunnel site,"" said Steve Barbet, head of communications for France's Nord Pas de Calais.

3536,"Related A Muslim teen was led out of a Texas school in handcuffs after a teacher mistook his homemade digital clock for a bomb, prompting accusations of Islamophobia and an online backlash Wednesday.

A photo of Ahmed Mohamed, 14, standing in handcuffs while wearing a t-shirt with the US space agency NASA's logo was retweeted thousands of times in a matter of hours and ""#IStandWithAhmed"" was the top trending hashtag on Twitter.

Among those voicing support for the boy was Hillary Clinton, who tweeted: ""Assumptions and fear don't keep us safe-they hold us back. Ahmed, stay curious and keep building.""

Mohamed told The Dallas Morning News that he was just trying to impress his teachers when he brought the clock to MacArthur High school on Monday.

""My hobby is to invent stuff,"" he said in a video posted on the paper's website that was filmed in his electronics-filled bedroom.

""I made a clock. It was really easy. I wanted to show something small at first... they took it wrong so I was arrested for a hoax bomb.""

Mohamed, who had loved robotics club in middle school and was hoping to find something similar in high school, said he didn't get the reaction he was looking for when he showed the clock to his engineering teacher.

""He was like, 'That's really nice,'"" Mohamed said. ""'I would advise you not to show any other teachers.'""

But the alarm went off during his English class, and that teacher told him it looked like a bomb and confiscated the clock.

The school called police and Mohamed was taken away in handcuffs amid suspicion that he intended to frighten people with the device.

The aspiring inventor, who lives in Irving just outside Dallas, said police would not let him call his parents during a lengthy interrogation. Once released, he was suspended from school for three days.

Police said Wednesday that they have determined that Mohamed had no malicious intent and it was ""just a naive set of circumstances.""

""We're not going to pursue this any further,"" Irving police chief Larry Bond told reporters.

Bond insisted that Mohamed's ethnicity had nothing to do with the police response.

""Our reaction would have been the same either way. That's a very suspicious device,"" Bond said.

He also insisted that officers did the right thing when they handcuffed Mohamed and brought him to a juvenile detention center for questioning.

All prisoners are handcuffed for their own safety, Bond said, adding ""unfortunately we've had people jump out of cars.""

A school district spokeswoman also stood by the school's response, telling reporters that once people see images of the homemade clock they will understand that ""we were doing everything with an abundance of caution.""

A photo provide by police to local media showed a flat, rectangular red digital clock face screwed into the dark plush interior of a silver case along with a circuit board and some wires.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations said the heavy-handed response is particularly suspicious given the current political climate in Irving.

Mayor Beth Van Duyne has claimed that Muslims are plotting to impose Sharia law in America.

""This all raises a red flag for us: how Irving's government entities are operating in the current climate,"" Alia Salem, who directs the council's North Texas chapter, told the Morning News.

""We're still investigating,"" she said, ""but it seems pretty egregious.""

Wired magazine was among those who responded to the incident with a mixture of humor and horror, posting an article entitled ""How to Make Your Own Homemade Clock That Isn't a Bomb"" and encouraging kids to bring them to school.

3918,"I live in an assisted living facility (Poplar Springs). Recently, I called 911 for two different situations. In both, the 911 operator asked me to hand the phone to one of our staff members. When I asked why, she said, “I want to ask about you and confirm what happened.” 

Now, if she needed to clarify location or situation, I can understand that. However, in both situations it was clear (by staff answers) they were asking if it really happened. To waste time having to look for someone (an authority figure) to verify my story could easily take five minutes or more to find one. 

That is a lot of time to waste in an emergency. A fire can quadruple in size in that time. A person can bleed to death from an arterial wound in that time period. Why? Because a 911 operator wasted it to question the caller’s honesty, instead of sending the proper responders to the scene. 

I know people call in false reports a lot, but that is no reason to question every caller’s honesty. Even in places like this. Yes, I know many people in facilities like ours have a mental illness or other brain disorders. But so do a lot people outside these places. However, that doesn’t mean they are less honest than a normal person. 

How do you expect people to call 911 in a real emergency if their honesty will automatically be in question? All you are doing is discouraging people from calling 911 when they really need it.

52,"An inmate at a maximum-security prison has been kept in segregation for two-and-a-half years, according to a report. 
 
		 
The Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) for HMP Whitemoor revealed that it detained seven of the 24 prisoners held in segregation for more than six months across England's high-security jails as of June 1 this year. 
  Whitemoor prison near March, Cambridgeshire   
Inspectors said a staffing ""merry-go-round"" meant inexperienced staff were needed to work on the segregation unit and management was ""poor"". 

			 
Prison rules enable a governor to arrange for a prisoner to be segregated - kept away from other inmates - for up to 72 hours before seeking authorisation from the secretary of state. Inmates can be segregated if they are deemed to be in danger, to prevent danger to other prisoners or as punishment for disruptive behaviour. 



 
The IMB cited a United Nations protocol which defines solitary confinement for more than 22 hours a day as torture and said m any inmates in segregation at the Cambridgeshire jail were often confined for longer. 

The report, covering the year to May 2015, said: ""Although often faced with challenging prisoners, requiring officers to get into and  out of personal protection equipment, on most days staff were able to offer a full  regime. 

""It was not however unusual for some curtailment to be necessary,  meaning that residents might miss showers, corporate worship, phone calls and  exercise. At its worst, for example on 10 occasions in April, the Seg (segregation unit) had to be  locked down."" 

The regime in place was ""much the same"" as that which HM Inspectorate of Prisons found in 2011 to be ""inadequate"", inspectors added. 

			 
""One of the other problems noted by Inspectors was the poor management  arrangements for the Seg. Whilst there have been definite improvements, with  greater adherence to procedures and standards, and consistency of decision-making,  new prison-wide staffing arrangements meant that the custody manager  responsible for the Seg was more frequently away from the unit, for example  acting as orderly officer, managing detail or on nights,"" the report said. 

"" We do not blame  Whitemoor managers for this merry go-round, which results from centrally-imposed  staffing norms."" 

A high-profile terrorist prisoner recently won a legal challenge at the UK's highest court against his segregation at HMP Whitemoor. 

Kamel Bourgass, an Algerian who is serving 17 years for conspiracy to commit public nuisance by using poisons or explosives in relation to the 2002 Ricin terrorist plot, was segregated for extended periods. 

			 
The Supreme Court ruled in July his confinement, for periods or more than a month, was unlawful beyond the initial 72-hour period.

2282,"Style isn’t just about what you wear. It’s how you express and empower yourself. The clothes on your back are just one of the many ways you convey that. A lot of times people try to put style in a box: trendy, preppy, formal, etc. – but like most things, no one’s style fits inside one little box. 
 

 
With a lot of you starting class, internships and work, you be thinking of whether you should try to tweak your style for the new season. After all, you could use your back to school budget to completely overhaul your style, right? It’s tiring trying to keep up with what’s cool or embrace a style that’s not really you; it’s much easier to take time to come into your own and highlight your true self. Remember: this is your year. But if you’re not exactly sure what your style is in the first place, here’s a short 3-step guide to figuring it out! 
 How to Find Your Personal Style  
Look for keywords, not categories – The terms above – trendy, preppy, formal – aren’t going to be complete representations of your unique style. They’re great categories for placing an outfit in, but you likely don’t rep them every single day. Instead, think of how you’d describe yourself, like daring, experimental, laidback. Let these words help you pull clothes off the rack for the dressing room. That way when you look at a piece, you can see whether it will embody your spirit, not put you in a box. 
 
Make tweaks, don’t overhaul – Be real, how many of you want to start from scratch with your closet at times? I like to think of myself as always evolving, not completely transforming. As humans, it’s practically our jobs to change over time, slow and steady. Style works the same way. If you’ve changed from last year – you’re willing to take more risks, less into checking in with trends, hoping to come off as more mature – now is the time to find clothing that reflects that. No need to go too crazy, just add those words to your original list. 
 
Put an end to the comparison game – Now is the time to be inspired, not envious. Your peers and coworkers’ styles, the blogger of the moment, street style inspiration on Pinterest , there’s a wealth of information out there. But once you stop being inspired and start making comparisons, it’s time to separate yourself form those sources. If you struggle with comparison, try this: the moment your mind begins to compare your look to the one on your digital feed, shut it down. Close your laptop or put your phone in your pocket. You can’t always remove yourself from the person sitting next to you, but when your comparison is digital, it’s best to try a little self-induced timeout. Before logging on, empower yourself with positive thoughts and self-love. 
 
How do YOU embrace your personal style? Share with me below!

1352,"(CNNMoney) -  
Two of Uber's biggest rivals are joining forces. 
 
San Francisco-based Lyft and Chinese firm Didi Kuaidi announced a strategic international partnership on Wednesday that will make it easier for users to hail rides while visiting either country. 

In practice, it'll mean that Lyft users can travel to China, hail a ride using their Lyft app, and pay in U.S. dollars. Chinese travelers can do the same in the U.S. using Didi's app. 

Travelers will be able to take advantage of the deal in early 2016. 

And there are millions who will potentially do so. According to Lyft, nearly 8 million people traveled between China and the U.S. in 2014. 

""Our vision was never just about the United States,"" said Lyft cofounder John Zimmer in a press conference announcing the partnership. ""It's just the start."" 

The announcement puts both firms in a better position to take on Uber, which is pouring resources into Asia, particularly China and India. 

Both Zimmer and Didi President Jean Liu seem confident in their two-against-one approach. 

Zimmer said Lyft's business is ""stronger than ever and that the company's business in New York City alone has tripled over the past few months. 

Liu called the deal the marker of a ""brand new era for the global ride-sharing industry."" 

Didi Kuaidi -- which offers everything from black cars and bus services to taxis and ridesharing -- closed a $3 billion round just last week. 

The partnership isn't all that surprising. Earlier this year, Didi invested $100 million into Lyft as part of its latest $530 million funding round, which was led by Japanese e-commerce firm Rakuten. 

Lyft is valued at $2.5 billion, according to CB Insights. Uber's valuation, on the other hand, is $51 billion. 

But according to Liu, Uber has far from won the battle. 

""People don't realize that ridesharing is still in its infancy,"" she said. ""We will be able to push the evolution of this industry to the next level."" 

That involves sharing best practices, market knowledge and technology. The partnership will also help with the regulatory hurdles that typically go along with entering new markets. 

Zimmer did not respond to questions during the Q&A about whether Lyft would partner with other ridesharing companies in markets like India.",7a102fb1-9f85-432d-84c4-0ee61167b2b2,News,2015-09-17T06:07:15Z,KWCH 12,Uber rivals band together to form U.S.-China alliance,0.0,News

Anyway,  later on I kept hearing Looking For You at various soul do's but was never able to source a copy. At that time I wasn't aware that it was the flip side of the 1966 release I'll Take Good Care Of You. Earlier this year the fact that this was to be released as an RSD15 release nearly got me out of my bed at 05:30 but not quite. Fortunately when I visited Monorail the following day there was a copy which was duly purchased and has been played regularly since.
Mr Mimms is still with us at the age of 81. He stopped recording in 1977 became a born again Christian and found a career as a minister returning to recording in 2007 and releasing a Gospel album. His biggest hit was Cry Baby released in 1963, a song which would later become a staple of Janis Joplin's.

3550,"Of all the recent transactions involving Oregon-based companies, the sale of Elemental Technologies to Amazon Web Services might be the most important to watch.

StanCorp Financial Group and Precision Castparts have deeper roots in Oregon and employ more people. But Elemental in many ways is the poster child for emerging home-grown Oregon technology companies that are an important part of any algorithm for future economic growth in the state. Though Elemental's decision does not necessarily predict the future of other emerging local companies, it does raise some important questions. Can Elemental, a video software company, still be Oregon's next technology leader under outside ownership? And does its sale signal that other home-grown companies also are likely to be sold when they reach a certain size? The answers to those questions aren't clear, in part because economic and business conditions can change quickly. But Elemental's path over the next few years, at the least, should help define the possibilities.

Technology companies loom large in Oregon's future for a host of reasons. High-tech already is the most important cylinder in the state's economy. The top three technology job classifications – computer and semiconductor manufacturing and software publishing – account for a combined 75,000 jobs, with thousands more technology-related jobs represented in other industries. Software companies are a particularly good fit for Portland, which lacks available land for large-scale manufacturing. And technology-related industries pay more than the median wage and help attract talented workers to the state.

the opinion section, 

contact Erik Lukens, 

editorial and commentary editor, at elukens@oregonian.com or 503-221-8142. But those impressive statistics have been skewed by two companies. Tektronix was Oregon's original technology giant but has been in decline for three decades and was sold in 2007 to Danaher Corp., which is based in Washington, D.C. As Tektronix was declining, Intel was rapidly expanding. Though it is based in Santa Clara, California, the semiconductor manufacturer has more employees in Washington County than in any other location. But as any city or state married to the technology industry knows, companies rarely stay on top forever. What company will be Oregon's next technology giant? Given the state's justifiable reluctance to enter bidding wars to convince companies to move here from elsewhere, the next huge employer probably will need to be home grown.

Elemental still could be that company. In broad terms, this deal could turn out three ways. Elemental, with resources at its disposal that would not have been possible otherwise, could thrive under Amazon Web Services, a unit of Amazon.com, and become a large employer in Oregon. The company could thrive, but move a significant portion of the jobs created elsewhere. The company could plateau or regress for reasons that have nothing to do with ownership or location.

Elemental Chief Executive Officer said that the acquisition by Amazon puts his company in the best position for growth. ""Every way I looked at it, the impact we're going to be able to have is more significant than we could have had alone,"" he told Mike Rogoway of The Oregonian/OregonLive. In an email, he also said he fully expects some of Oregon's other emerging technology companies to go public in the near future. Just because joining with a company that has significant resources and connections was the right decision for Elemental doesn't mean it will be for a company that has another product and competes in a different galaxy of the technology universe.

While watching Elemental's progress under Amazon, Oregonians also should pay attention to Blackman, who grew up in the Portland area and is a leader in the technology and business communities. Blackman, who has been an enthusiastic champion of Portland as a place to do business, said he and the company expect to remain involved in the community. That's important.

Blackman and other young, home-grown technology entrepreneurs are the assets that Oregon really needs to hold onto. Look at companies that have kept their headquarters in one location for a long time – especially places outside of the Northeast and California – and you often see that the companies are in or near the hometowns of their founders. That's why Nike is in the Portland area and Microsoft is in the Seattle area. It's certainly the only reason Berkshire Hathaway is in Omaha, Nebraska, or Walmart in Bentonville, Arkansas.

Blackman is young enough to start another company one day if he so chooses, though he said he's ""not investing any cycles thinking about what's next at the moment."" But even if he doesn't, he very well could be a mentor to someone who does create another great Oregon company. And for all the attention that has been placed on the sales of Oregon companies lately, it's more important to make sure that the state becomes a fertile place to grow new companies.

2800,"A powerful earthquake struck Chile on Wednesday night, killing at least five people, authorities said, and triggering tsunami advisories as far away as California and Hawaii. 
 
About 1 million people were evacuated from affected areas, said Ricardo Toro, director of the National Office of Emergency. 

Fatalities included a woman killed by a falling roof and a second one fatally hit by flying rocks, President Michelle Bachelet said. 

The quake's epicenter was 46 kilometers (29 miles) west of Illapel, according to a preliminary assessment from the U.S. Geological Survey. 

Illapel residents reported damage to their homes, Interior Minister Jorge Burgos told reporters. 

Massive waves 

The quake had a depth of 25 kilometers (15.5 miles), USGS said. 

Chile's national emergency agency issued a tsunami alert, ordering evacuations in coastal areas from Arica to Puerto Aysen. 

Large tsunami waves washed along the Chilean coast near the quake's epicenter. In Coquimbo, Chile, a wave was measured at more than 15 feet, according to the U.S. National Tsunami Warning center. 

Tsunami watch 

Tsunami advisories were issued thousands of miles away, including in Hawaii and California. 

A tsunami advisory was issued for the coastal areas of Southern California, which means strong currents are likely and residents should stay away from the shore. 

Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties warned residents to stay away from beaches and harbors due to the chances of strong currents. But authorities in the three counties said land inundation is not expected. 

""Widespread hazardous tsunami waves are possible"" along the coast of Chile and Peru, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said, and a tsunami watch is in effect for Hawaii. 

A tsunami watch is issued ""to alert emergency management officials and the public of an event which may later impact the watch area,"" the center says. A warning is issued when a ""potential tsunami with significant widespread inundation is imminent or expected."" 

Even New Zealand, which is 6,000 miles away from the quake's epicenter, issued a tsunami warning. 

Strong tidal currents and large waves are expected in some areas, said Shane Bayley of New Zealand's Ministry of Civil Defence. 

Power loss 

In La Serena, a coastal city just north of Coquimbo, pictures taken at a shopping mall showed walls and signs toppled to the floor, ceiling tiles caved in as well as chairs, benches and tables covered in rubble. 

Coquimbo Mayor Cristian Galleguillos told CNN Chile that 95% of the city had lost electrical power. Residents evacuated before waves started hitting the coastline, he said. 

'Earthquake felt really intense' 

More than a dozen aftershocks of magnitude 4.9 or higher rattled residents. Some could be felt in the country's capital, about 230 kilometers (145 miles) away from the quake's epicenter. 

""Everybody ran outside. The windows rattled. Things fell. ... The impact was strong,"" said Emily Hersh, who lives in Santiago. ""Even after I stepped outside, I felt the ground moving."" 

The earthquake hit during rush hour, causing traffic snarls that left many people stuck in the streets as they tried to get home, said Fabrizio Guzman, emergency communications manager for World Vision in Chile. 

""There were many people afraid, running in the streets, when the shaking started,"" he said in a statement. ""The earthquake felt really intense and seemed to last for several minutes."" 

'Ring of Fire' 

Chile is in one of the most earthquake-prone regions in the world. 

The country sits on an arc of volcanoes and fault lines circling the Pacific Ocean known as the ""Ring of Fire."" The area experiences frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. 

Since 1973, Chile has had more than a dozen quakes of magnitude-7.0 and above.",303b096c-eb7d-47c9-8a21-6633cc866bed,News,2015-09-17T05:12:34Z,KSBW Channel.com,Quake strikes off Chile's coast; 5 killed,0.0,News

Junior defender Hannah Gerber dribbles the ball past two defenders during the team's match against Utica College on Oct. 11, 2014, at Higgins Stadium. 
  
The Ithaca College field hockey team kicked off its 2015 campaign Sept. 1 against SUNY Oneonta in a neutral site competition at Hartwick College. The Bombers were looking to improve on their 8–8 record from last year, which included a 2–0 win over the Red Dragons, who finished 11–8 last season. 
 
The Bombers wasted little time, peppering Oneonta’s senior goalkeeper Krista Servedio, with three shots in the first six-plus minutes of action. It was the fourth shot, however, that found the back of the net for the Bombers’ first tally of the season. Junior forward Colleen Keegan-Twombly tipped in a shot from the top of the circle off the stick of senior back Caitlin O’Brien for an early 1–0 lead. 
 
Ten minutes later, the Bombers extended their lead when junior forward Cassie Schuttrumpf came up with a loose ball and knocked it home for a 2–0 advantage. The offensive onslaught did not stop there. Sophomore Amanda Schell got in on the action, netting her first goal of the year off a rebound to boost the Blue and Gold to a 3–0 lead. 
 
The Red Dragons finally broke through in the 28th minute, with senior Hannah Hayward tallying her first goal of the season, off an assist from freshman Allyson Wells, a dribbling shot that found its way past the South Hill squad’s junior goalkeeper Katie Lass, making it a 3–1 Bombers game. 
 
The offensive fireworks diminished as the second half got underway. The Bombers added only four shots to bring their shot total on the night to 17, while the Red Dragons were held to just three shots, for a total of seven on the evening. Lass made a key save late in the game, but the Red Dragons never mounted a serious rally and the game ended in a 3–1 Bombers victory. 
 
With the win, the South Hill squad moves to 1–0, while the loss drops SUNY Oneonta to 0–1. The next contest for the Bombers will be their home debut against Washington College at 1 p.m. Sept. 5 at Higgins Stadium.",e1495e6a-8928-4a61-a495-6ead7c2f27bc,News,2015-09-02T05:12:58Z,Ithacan,Field hockey team triumphs over Red Dragons in 3–1 win 1 hour ago | Sports,0.0,News
3656,"Not everyone is excited about The Muppets ' return to prime time. Pro-family group One Million Moms has launched a campaign against the ""perverted"" new show. ""1MM suspects there are going to be a lot of shocked moms and dads when they discover that the family-friendly Muppets of the 1970s are no more,"" their petition reads. Unlike the original series, in which the Muppets put on a variety sketch show, the updated series is filmed mockumentary-style, which allows the characters to directly address real world subjects rather than just deliver slapstick comedy. This switch has apparently prompted the group to launch a petition warning parents to take action against the show. This is the same group behind the 2012 boycott of J.C. Penney for ads that featured same-sex couples. 5 reasons why The Muppets is our new TV obsession Among some of the objections: the Kermit the Frog billboard that touts ""full frontal nudity,"" Miss Piggy declaring she's a pro-choice feminist during an MSNBC interview; a claim that the puppets will be will be discussing sex, drugs, abortion and promiscuity. None of these examples appear to have come from actually having viewed an episode. Instead it seems as if ABC's over-the-top promotional blitz has been taken a bit too seriously. Also, The Muppets , as with many other family shows, has always included somewhat adult humor that has been written to fly over kids' heads. ""ABC has ruined The Muppets ,"" claims the petition, urging readers to send it to everyone they know as well as reach out to ABC to ""drop all plans"" to air The Muppets .

3442,"The psychology behind successful Web design Posted by : brij fbEducator Wednesday, 30 September 2015 As designers, we are user advocates first and foremost. We need to understand what users want versus need before they ever encounter our designs. Once they do encounter it, they must first feel safe and comfortable. This sometimes contrasts with our desire to innovate – which is why we have to align that desire with user goals. To do this, we need to grasp how our users’ brains work— the mental models they’ve created that help them navigate the Web. This understanding then gives us a platform from which to create, a process called neurodesign (introduced back in 2012). Photo…

1628,"CONFUSIONS ABOUT MULTICULTURATION 
Jan Pakulski 
Journal Sociology 2004, Vol. 50(1) 23-36 
CRITIQUE PAPER 

Submitted to: Prof. Jennelyn Gomez 

Good Samaritan Colleges City of Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija 

In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirement in Ed 106 Social Dimensions in Education 

Submitted by: Mary Joy V. Lumbania 

Purpose of the Study 

	The purpose of the study is to provide a clarification of the original meaning of multiculturalism as adopted in Austria. By means of a careful review of theoretically relevant literature and through different sociologist views about multiculturalism. This study seeks clarification about what will happen to Australian if they embrace multiculturalism.   The purpose of this study is to know the main goal of multiculturalism in Australian. 

Apparatus and Procedure 

Results 

	The clarification about the confusions of multiculturalism is not clear. The study is ended up in wide comparative analysis, comparing the outcomes in societies when Australian embraced the multiculturalism. After studying the possible outcomes of multiculturalism the Australian interpreted the multiculturalism as a form of ‘social contract’ between the majority and the diverse minorities. And the ‘social contract’ is about the majority accepts and protect minorities, affirms cultural differences and supports a degree of the majority. Law, justice system, parliamentary democracy and market economy is involves in the ‘social contract’. 

Conclusion 

	This paper suggests that multicultural has good effect in Australian. Multiculturalism’s main goal is to respect the diversity in Australia. Australian multiculturalism has always been ‘reciprocal’ in the sense of promoting both rights and duties/obligations. These rights are spelt out in a more explicit manner, including ‘the freedom to choose and maintain one’s own cultural identity’. Multiculturalism involves respect for cultural differences and sense of belonging and attachment to a particular way of...

Archant 
   
A malt firm underlined its commitment to practical sustainability as it unveiled its £5.4million state-of-the-art anaerobic digestion plant. 
  Share link    The official opening of the new anaerobic digestion plant at Muntons in Stowmarket by Baroness Scott. Baroness Scott and Nigel Davies (manufacturing and sustainability director). 
Stowmarket-based Muntons is set to generate a quarter of its electricity from the new plant, as well as recycling its own waste products into energy and into fertiliser for farmers. 

At a stroke, the just-completed plant has cut out about 3,000 tanker movements a year, thus reducing the site’s CO2 emissions by 340 tonnes. 

Muntons has led the way in establishing a policy of “sustainability that pays”, showing other businesses how investing in environmentally-friendly measures can be good for their bottom lines. 

It expects to recoup the cost of the plant within the next four and a half years. 
The official opening of the new anaerobic digestion plant at Muntons in Stowmarket by Baroness Scott. 
Guests, including Baroness Scott of Needham Market, who officially opened the plant on Friday, were shown how it treats liquid waste streams from Muntons’ malt extract production by taking it through a process where micro-organisms break down biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen. 

A second process generates biogas, used to power a Combined Heat and Power unit providing 500KWh of electricity, around 25% of Muntons’ base load requirement. Visitors were also taken on a nature trail set up around the plant so that staff could enjoy a wildlife walk. 

Manufacturing and sustainability director Nigel Davies said their aim was to influence their supply chain to do things more sustainably. 

Farmers growing barley to make the malt had the biggest carbon footprint, but the company would now be able to supply them with phosphate-rich fertiliser. 
The official opening of the new anaerobic digestion plant at Muntons in Stowmarket by Baroness Scott. 
“We are making this work for us locally,” he said. “It was important for us to lead by example.” 

The project has an “excellent” payback, and was meticulously researched and trialled before it was given the go-ahead, guests heard. 

Even so, it was initially hard to find lenders willing to back it because of scepticism about AD schemes. 

Baroness Scott described it as a “magnificent” project and said she was not surprised the company had won awards for sustainability. It was a scheme people in Suffolk could be proud of, she added.",cf1c9e74-1513-4eae-af83-0d029d85d64a,News,2015-09-30T08:36:41Z,East Anglian Daily Times,Malt firm Muntons leads by example as it unveils £5.4million AD plant,0.0,Blog

Klaus Meine is one of the most instantly recognizable voices in rock music. 
As lead singer for the German hard-rock band the Scorpions, Meine’s powerful tenor has guided the band through countless power-rock ballads — hit songs like “Rock You Like A Hurricane,” “Wind Of Change,” “Still Loving You” and “Big City Nights.” 

This year, the Scorpions celebrate their 50th anniversary with a new album, “Return To Forever,” and a commemorative world tour, which includes a stop Sunday night at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion in Gilford along with Queensryche. 

Meine talked with NH Weekend recently about the group’s latest album, its longevity and whether they’ll retire anytime soon. 

Happy 50th anniversary to the band. How does it feel to reach such a milestone? 

Yeah, I mean, to put a five in front of the 0, it feels a little bit scary in the first moment. Is it really that long? (Laughs) You join this very exclusive club of legendary artists, from the Stones to the Beach Boys, The Who — there are very few bands that (are) reaching this magic number, and now we’re one of them. You know, it feels great. 

Are you excited about the tour? 

Absolutely. Yeah. Even after all these years — we’ve done it so many times. 

How do you think American audiences compare with the rest of the world? 

Back in the ‘80s, we became very Americanized. It’s still very exciting because this is the old rock ‘n’ roll dream, you know — to play in the free world and to go on tour with a tour bus. 

How do you think the band has sustained itself? 

For us, it was always important to have the right chemistry in the band. And I guess we were lucky. We enjoyed life and we were ready to party every night as well, but yeah, that’s always a fine line. There are a lot of artists from the world of rock ‘n’ roll that really get burned up or didn’t survive this crazy ride, you know? 

Is there any part of recording and touring that still surprises you? 

It’s always exciting to create new pieces of music. How can you ever get tired of this? These days we play in front of three generations pretty much wherever we go, and it’s wonderful to see. 

How is the new album different from previous Scorpions albums? 

It has Scorpions DNA. It’s about heavy riffs, but it’s definitely also about melody. It’s about power rock ballads, you know. But it’s also about those big riffs, like “The Zoo” or “Big City Nights” and “Rock You Like A Hurricane,” all those songs. 

So, looking back on those older songs, how do they seem different to you now? 

It feels great sometimes to go back in time and realize that there’s still some great material we never really focused on or never touched all those years. 

Then of course, the question is: “What the hell? Why didn’t we release those songs back then because they came out so strong?” 

How do you sustain your vocals over such a long period of time? That’s got to be taxing. 

I mean, next to rock ‘n’ roll, discipline is an ugly word. I cannot change the strings like our guitar players if there’s a problem, so you take care that your vocal chords stay intact and powerful. 

Do you and (guitarist and founder) Rudolf Schenker share a special closeness because you’ve both been there since the beginning? 

We were friends. This is how this all started. It was not about having the superstar singer, a superstar guitarist with a super, super-duper ego, so it was all about going together to make this journey a worldwide success. 

Do you think the band will officially retire when this tour is over? 

We don’t make any plans any more. (Laughs.) After 200 concerts between 2010, 2012, we thought this could be, really, the end of the road. And it’s easy to say, ‘We’ll stop at this point,’ but it’s so much harder to do, because it’s so emotional. This is our life, you know. 

I guess when our fans listen to this new album “Return to Forever,” then they’ll know why we couldn’t stop at this point.

South Africa's center and captain Jean de Villiers delivers a press conference at Villa Park stadium in Birmingham, on September 25, 2015, during the Rugby Union World Cup 

But the veteran centre, who will lead South Africa into their crunch Pool B match against Samoa on Saturday, said he had a duty to repair the divisions in South Africa caused by the greatest upset in Rugby World Cup history. 

Asked whether he had expected coach Heyneke Meyer to drop him after last Saturday's defeat, de Villiers said: ""Yes I did. 

""After the backing that the coach has given me, I have to perform and show that I deserve that opportunity. 

""I'm very aware of the criticism he has undergone for selecting me."" 

There have been widespread calls in South Africa for Meyer and 34-year-old de Villiers to pay for the Japan defeat with their jobs. 

Even if South Africa win the Pool B match on Saturday, the coach and captain know they are not safe. 

""We all know how important this game is for our country,"" de Villiers said. 

""We are a very proud nation. What saddens me is to see how a loss like this can break the country apart. That's a responsibility that we (have) to rectify."" 

De Villiers said ""rugby is a game, but in South Africa it has become so much more than just a game and we carry that responsibility with us every single time we enter the field. We disappointed a lot of people last week. 

""We need to stand up. We put ourselves in this position and we need to get ourselves out of this position.""

                                “2015 Japan Microbiology Analyzers and Consumables Market” is a new analysis of major business opportunities emerging in the Japanese automated microbiology market during the nextfive years. The report examines key trends, reviews current and emerging assays; analyzes potential applications of innovative diagnostic technologies; forecasts volume and sales for molecular diagnostic, microbial identification, antibiotic susceptibility, blood culture, urine screening and immunodiagnostic procedures, as well as over 100 infectious disease tests by assay, application, market segment; profiles leading players and potential market entrants; and suggests alternative business expansion strategies for suppliers. 

Rationale 

The level of automation in the microbiology laboratory has been lagging behind that of other major clinical laboratory segments, such as chemistry and hematology. The slow acceptance of the technology is in part due to the complexity of developing automation suitable for microbiology tests. 

The introduction of automated microbiology instrumentation has been delayed by a number of intrinsic and technical problems. The diffusion of automated microbiology 
             systems, once the technology was developed, has not matched that of other automated laboratory technologies. The acquisition of automation in microbiology has been slowed by forces less easily identifiable than the effects of various reimbursement plans. Some laboratorians still believe that current instrumentation is not the ultimate technology and expect better automation on the horizon. 

The driving force behind the need for rapid reporting of microbiological test results is the clinical relevance in a time of financial austerity, a time when cost and health care effectiveness to the patient and diagnostician looms ever larger, and where after-the-fact results at high expense are coming under severe scrutiny worldwide. 

This comprehensive report will assist diagnostics industry executives, as well as companies planning to diversify into the dynamic and rapidly expanding Japanese microbiology market, in evaluating emerging opportunities and developing effective business strategies.

1707,"This is not a scene from HYENA ROAD.
It is a scene from the genuinely brilliant
BRING ME THE HEAD OF TIM HORTON:
The Making of ""Hyena Road"" Hyena Road (2015)
Dir. Paul Gross
Starring: Paul Gross, Rossif Sutherland, Christine Horne, Niamatullah Arghandabi
Review By Greg Klymkiw
Even though the word ""Hyena"" is in the title, try not to confuse the abomination that is Hyena Road with the superb 2014 Hyena. The former is yet another dreadful Paul Gross war film, the latter a grim, gritty UK crime picture about police corruption and the Albanian Mob in contemporary London. The former will be released wide across Canadian screens later this year, whilst the latter has disappeared without a trace. Both films, however, played at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). The former this year, the latter last year.
Canadians have a real treat in store for them. They will not see Hyena. They will, however, see Hyena Road. This is primarily thanks to the largesse of the Canadian taxpayers themselves, who forked over a good chunk of the $12.5 million needed to put this rah-rah slice of propagandistic pro-war excrement on the screen and, of course, the ever - ahem - visionary Cineplex Entertainment theatre chain (monopoly) which would prefer to exhibit endless prints of awful studio pictures and, naturally, Paul Gross movies, rather than genuinely great Canadian films (or, for that matter, the very best indie foreign films).
Hyena Road has one thing going for it, though. While it's genuinely awful, it's not quite as laughably horrendous as Gross's previous war picture Passchendaele. That said, it might even be worse - not in terms of craft - but the fact that it extols the virtues of Canada's role in a war the country should never have become a part of. There isn't a single war in the Middle East which should have happened, never mind with the assistance of Canada's Armed Forces, but happen they did AND with Canada's help (not to mention the senseless deaths of our soldiers and those of innocent Afghanis and Iraquis).
So, what does the director of Men With Brooms (a witless purported comedy about the sport of curling) do? As he proved successful enough with Passchendaele, his WWI anti-war effort (a film which had its box-office grosses in Canada bought and paid for with oodles of marketing assistance from the Canadian taxpayer and the screen-count-largesse of the - ahem - visionary Cineplex Entertainment), Gross scratched his noggin and crapped out the fine idea of a pro-war propaganda film in Afghanistan.
Oh Canada. We stand on guard for thee by wiping out Afghani villages to ensure the safety of the American armed forces.
Yup, this is what we get with Hyena Road:
Pete Mitchell (Paul Gross) is the Canuck in charge of safely building a road through Taliban territory to allow for the safer passage of coalition forces (America, really). Mitchell, however, is no mere lean, mean, fighting machine, he's a military intelligence (a bit of an oxymoron, mais non?) officer. His real goal is to ferret out The Ghost (Niamatullah Arghandabi), a mujahideen who could prove to be an excellent ally. To this end, Mitchell puts the brave sniper (a bit of an oxymoron, mais non?) in the role of front man for this operation.
Ryan Sanders (Rossif Sutherland) has scruples, however. He doesn't like being manipulated and he refuses to kill children. Isn't that special? Good thing too, since he's been boinking Jennifer Bowman (Christine Horne), the film's token female window dressing who runs the command centre (and also appears afflicted with - horrors - morning sickness). It sure would be Gross if he killed kids whilst his girlie-pie is carrying his eventual progeny (to no doubt grow up to kill more people in battle during the next senseless war).
Amidst the simplistic military maneuvers and soap suds outlined above, Gross stages several big violent action set pieces with both Jordan and Manitoba's Carberry Desert nicely standing in for Afghanistan. Here is one aspect that the film modestly excels at. Gross wisely crews up with artists who've plied their trade on good, if not great Canadian films.
Thanks to one of Canada's most gifted cinematographers Karim Hussain (We Are Still Here, Hobo With A Shotgun), and the equally gifted Canuck editor David Wharnsby (Guy Maddin's Saddest Music in the World and Sarah Polley's Away From Her), the action more-than-ably rip-snorts along, providing superb war-porn for action aficionados.
Where these sequences fail, however, is Gross's awful screenplay which puts dull dialogue in the mouths of the characters - if one can even call them characters as opposed to simple types - and, of course, unlike genuinely great (if not even good war pictures) we have no human being to hang our hopes and dreams upon as they march forward into the carnage of battle.
Though Hyena Road is a disgrace and has no business receiving taxpayer financing and even less business being featured as a Gala Presentation during TIFF, one of the world's most prestigious film festivals, its real problem lies in the fact that the movie is just plain bad as opposed to being the unmitigated stinker Passchendaele was.
That film was so awful I blessed it with my lowest Film Corner rating imaginable: THE TURD FOUND BEHIND HARRY'S CHARBROIL GRILL & DINING LOUNGE. But WOE! I could not even bring myself to affix my second-lowest Film Corner Rating to Hyena Road, the ever-famous, ONE PUBIC HAIR (which I proudly bestowed upon Sharknado).
Nope. Hyena Road belongs to a special class of bad movies - a picture so dull and mediocre it rates the most dull and mediocre of all the Film Corner Ratings.

1863,"L ast fall one of my sons anguished over the price of a $150 textbook for a college calculus class. 
 
He looked for a used version or a rental, to no avail. So he dutifully bought the new book, put it on his desk in his dorm room, and never looked at it again. He used parts of a digital supplement packaged with it. The book, though, still in pristine condition, lies in a bin in his room at home. He wasn’t able to sell it back. 
 
There’s nothing unusual about that story, which makes it all the more disturbing, especially as college costs escalate. I hear similar examples all too frequently from the students I work with. A few semesters ago, a student in one of my classes even asked me outright: ""If I buy this book, will we use it?"" 
 
Federal regulations that took effect in 2010 were intended to provide clarity on textbook costs and, ideally, to make course materials more affordable. The regulations require publishers to disclose prices to faculty members and allow students to purchase books, CDs, and other supplemental material separately rather than as a bundle. The law also requires colleges to provide a list of required books and materials for students when they register for classes. 
 
That approach seems to be working, at least to an extent. Recent data from the National Association of College Stores show that students spent nearly 20 percent less on required course materials in the 2014-15 school year than they did in 2007-8. But that still amounts to $563 for an academic year, with a typical textbook selling for $79 (up from $57 in 2007). 
 
Increasingly, students simply refuse to buy textbooks even if professors require them, which is not surprising. Over the past four years, surveys have found that two-thirds to three-quarters of college students refused to buy textbooks because costs were too high and many instructors used only a few chapters. Others buy bootleg digital copies or photocopy chapters from books that other students have bought. Many alter their class schedules based on the price of textbooks. 
 
So what’s the point of textbooks? I’ve never been a fan of them, either as a student or as a professor. By textbooks, I mean books that survey the breadth of a topic, chapter by boring chapter. They are intended to feed required information to students, not to help them think or learn. As an undergraduate, I found these types of books turgid and pedantic. They offered little in the way of enlightenment. Rather, they felt like punishment. Like students today, I avoided them whenever I could. 
 
All too often, professors use textbooks and lectures in tandem. They start with the book and plan a course around it, picking a chapter here and a chapter there, or simply following along with the author’s outline and instructor’s supplement. Then they assemble students in a lecture and tell them the points of the textbook they should pay attention to. (Or should have paid attention to had they bought the book.) 
 
That approach emphasizes facts over thinking. It looks at information as rare and static rather than abundant and dynamic. The world has moved on from that model. But in far too many cases, education hasn’t, treating students as empty vessels that need filling rather than as distinct individuals who need guidance in learning on their own. It’s an information-first approach rather than a learning-first approach, one that emphasizes the what rather than the how and the why. 
 
I certainly understand textbooks’ attraction for teachers, especially overworked, underpaid adjuncts and graduate students who lack the time and resources to teach any other way. The books provide a ready-made framework for classes. They offer a consistent form of information that instructors can rely on across multiple class sections. They save time by cutting down on the need to constantly search for new material, especially when publishers provide lesson plans, PowerPoint presentations, and quizzes. And yes, even in a world of dynamic information, students need some foundational information and understanding to work with. 
 
So I’m not arguing that textbooks are evil or that instructors who use them are remiss. But here’s what I would like to see teachers do: Before you assign a textbook, check the price. Ask yourself whether students really need it and will truly learn from reading it. Check to see whether an open-source alternative is available. Scour the web and enlist your college’s librarians to find articles and posts that provide the same — or even better — information as in the textbook. Have your students find and recommend readings for your class. Work with colleagues to create a shared pool of effective course materials. Work with your teaching center to improve your approach to using class materials and class time for learning. 
 
In short, work through the decision to assign a textbook as you would a research question: Gather information. Weigh competing options and opinions. Move beyond the obvious. Innovate wherever possible. Revise. Seek feedback from peers. Revise again. Then justify your conclusion in clear, convincing terms. 
 
That’s what you expect your students to do. It’s not easy. But then neither is paying hundreds of dollars a semester for unused textbooks.

Comments 

Kiev, Sep 22: Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko today told the country’s security council that staying out of the NATO alliance was a “criminal” policy that his government is ready to reverse. More than 8,000 people have died in Ukraine’s fight against separatist rebels in the east since April 2014. Russia backed the rebels, fearing that the pro-Western course of the new Kiev government would make it a NATO ally. 

“The decision on the non-alliance policy which was announced by the previous government is criminal in terms of security and strategic interests of our state,” Poroshenko said, citing an opinion poll showing 60 per cent of Ukrainians supporting potential NATO membership. (Also Read: Burkina president Michel Kafando sceptical about proposed post-coup deal) 

Poroshenko, who chaired the security council with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in attendance, said any decision to join the alliance will be subject to a popular vote. Before the February 2014 uprising which toppled pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, the majority of Ukrainians opposed joining NATO, but many now see the alliance as their best defense from a foreign military threat. NATO officials say Ukraine needs to enact political, economic, social and military reforms to be considered for membership.

2036,"FOXBOROUGH -- Tom Brady is getting ready for one of his biggest rivals, a Rex Ryan-led Bills group that just dominated another New England Patriots rival, the AFC-favorite Indianapolis Colts. 
 
While discussing his prep for Ryan's defenses, which have held Brady to an 88.9 passer rating (his career rating is 96.1) , Brady took a subtle jab at the Colts. 
 
""You can expect the worst and expect the loudest and that's what we practice when we're out there,"" Brady said in regards to the Bills' stadium noise. ""(Coach Belichick) tries to make it harder for us in the game. Not really being able to hear anything, it just requires a lot of non-verbal communication -- everyone being on the same page, knowing your calls, knowing your assignments."" 
 
""Being able to work on things that we're doing really well so we can go out there and play confidently,"" Brady continued. ""If you don't play that way, you get really defensive as an offense. I think the Colts, they got really, they got pushed around."" 
 
Andrew Luck completed just 53.1 percent of passes a week ago in Buffalo, throwing two touchdowns and two interceptions. His 63.6 passer rating was the 13th-worst of his career. 
 
""I think (Ryan) tries to play to the strength of the players,"" Brady said. ""I think he tries to give those guys a chance every week, and that's all you can ask for as a coach -- to put the guys in the best position they can to take advantage of opportunities and make the plays, and not put them in the position where they can't do the things the coaches ask them to do. That's probably our philosophy on offense, too...You develop a style and rhythm, and you try to keep teams off balance by scheme and how you run certain plays, and you complement one play with the next. And I think that's how he plays defense. He complements one scheme with another, makes it hard to (identify) what you're looking at.""",31aed840-d4c5-4303-a9ab-a018e296dad4,News,2015-09-16T17:20:41Z,MassLive,Tom Brady: Rex Ryan's Buffalo Bills defense 'pushed around' rival Indianapolis Colts,0.0,News

4772,"Thinking about what happens after we die can be pretty frightening, which is why I love stories that make us really think about how we want to spend our time here on Earth. 
 
We’ve seen some pretty unbelievable-yet-true tales here at LittleThings, like the new mother who came back to life after childbirth when she felt her newborn’s heart beat on her chest. There’s just no other way to describe it than a miracle. 
 
However, when a person remains brain dead or on life support for such a long time, it can be easy for people to lose hope and even question if the person suffering would be better off letting go. That’s exactly what happened after 12-year-old Martin Pistorius of South Africa suddenly fell ill and was diagnosed with a degenerative illness, leaving him in a vegetative state. 
 
For 12 long years, Pistorius became trapped inside his own body. He believes he woke up around 14 or 15 years old, but everyone around him thought he was completely unconscious to the world around him. He even overheard his mother say she wished he was dead, but knew she was heartbroken seeing her son lay there, silently suffering. 
 
In the following powerful NBC interview, we learn what life was like for Pistorius, trapped with his thoughts for over a decade.

Chhattisgarh Education Minister Kedar Kashyap on Wednesday asked the School Education Department to withdraw a controversial chapter in Class X social science textbook of the State school curriculum which held working women responsible for increasing unemployment rate of men. 

“The chapter has been withdrawn with immediate effect,” Mr. Kashyap told reporters after the main Opposition party in the State the Congress took to streets against the “disrespectful” reference towards women. 

“Very few women worked before Independence, however the number of working women increased in all the fields these days which has directly contributed to the increase in unemployment rate of men,” read a paragraph on page No. 181 of the textbook.

Fortunately, Jackman has weighed in on the debate with his choice for who should don the adamantium claws in his stead in an interview with MTV News.
“I haven’t really given it a lot of thought,” Jackman said. “I’ve been asked that question a lot, and I’m always like, ‘I don’t wanna make it too easy on the studio to replace me,’ you know? I’ve still got one more to do. I’m sure they’re already talking about it, and there’s some actor [they’ve told] ‘shh, keep it quiet but we want you next.‘” After a bit of thought on who could play a younger, re-imagined Wolverine, Jackman made his choice. “He’s younger than me for sure,” Jackman said. “I think Tom Hardy would be a great Wolverine.” Hardy, who is no stranger to the comic book genre thanks to his role as Bane in The Dark Knight Rises and an upcoming adaptation of 100 Bullets, seems to be Hollywood’s choice for any big role with a potential vacancy looming. UK oddsmakers have Hardy as a frontrunner to take over the James Bond franchise following Daniel Craig’s eventual departure. Though some actors believe others could portray the suave spy, and the Internet still seems pretty invested in Idris Elba for the role. Jackman will star in an upcoming sequel to The Wolverine.

Mr McDonnell said there would be an ""institutional review"" of a ""whole range"" of organisations to see whether they are fit for purpose, and called for renewed investment in the tax office to close down loopholes that allow large corporations to pay minimal tax. 
  John McDonnell called for the introduction of a new 'national bank'   
The MP for Hayes and Harlington called for the introduction of a new ""national bank"" to help the UK's long-term investment infrastructure. 

			 
Mr McDonnell also said he wants a return to separate government departments to manage public expenditure and help drive economic growth. 



 
The new shadow chancellor highlighted an annual tax gap of £120 billion, saying that a ""significant proportion"" of that should be collected. 

He told LBC radio: ""What we need to do now is invest in HMRC, get the tax inspectors to work and start closing down some of these loopholes. 

""It is appalling that actually some of the biggest corporations are not just having their corporation tax cut by (Chancellor George) Osborne to the lowest level we have ever seen, at 18%, but in addition to that, even with low levels of taxation, they are not paying their way. I find that appalling."" 

Mr McDonnell added: ""We have put together a group of economists that will come together as an economic advisory council. 

			 
""One of the tasks I am going to be giving them is a review of all tax legislation and a review of the role of HMRC so we can get back to the state doing what it should do, (which) is making sure we collect our taxes."" 

The chairman and make-up of the new body will be announced within the next fortnight, he said. 

Mr McDonnell added: ""I am looking to have an institutional review of a whole range of organisations to see whether or not they are fit for purpose at the moment and how they can be improved, and that includes a review of the Treasury itself."" 

And he called for a reorganisation of government departments to focus on long-term growth. 

			 
He said: ""I would like to see the current BIS (Department for Business, Innovation and Skills) actually transformed into an economic development department. 

""I think what we should be doing is saying to the Treasury, 'do your job', about managing monetary and fiscal policy alongside the Bank of England, which will remain independent but should have a new mandate, but also making sure the Treasury does its job about monitoring properly efficient public expenditure. 

""But let's have a department that actually drives economic growth and investment."" 

Labour is also arguing for the launch of a new state investment bank, Mr McDonnell said, to stabilise long-term investment infrastructure. 

He said: ""That would be a state bank, a nationalised bank, if you like, exactly the same as they have in Germany and elsewhere. 

			 
""What I would like to do as well is build up a state sovereign fund."" 

Mr McDonnell vowed that Labour would tackle the nation's financial deficit. 

He said: ""What George Osborne is doing is basically loading the payment on the deficit on middle and low earners and some with no earnings at all, those on welfare benefits. 

""It is disgracefully unfair, so what we are saying is, we will tackle the deficit first of all by making sure corporations and the rich pay their taxes, full stop. 

""Secondly we will not be making the tax cuts to the corporations that the Government is now planning, and we will make sure as well that we start preparing a long-term investment plan that gives us prosperity. 

""If we can get reasonable growth back into the economy we can tackle the deficit, as long as we make sure people are paying their taxes.""

4331,"Apologies for walking on trodden ground. None of what’s below is new. Many of you already know everything in here, but I feel like this is a good opportunity to review why our position is our position. I’ll do my best to keep this simple and short. Just like all the world’s best analysis! 
 
Over the last little while, I’ve written a few things about Clutch . The specific stat might be difficult to explain to the average fan, but the idea is a basic one. Teams with high Clutch scores have had really good timing. Teams with low Clutch scores have had really bad timing. Timing is important! This explains a lot of the difference we see between actual wins and BaseRuns wins, which you can just think of as “expected wins.” This year, the five most clutch teams in baseball so far have beaten their BaseRuns win total by a combined 45. The five least clutch teams in baseball so far have fallen short of their BaseRuns win total by a combined 43. It’s hugely important, and this isn’t a one-year phenomenon. 
 

 
I have BaseRuns information going back to 2002, so let’s plot team Clutch score and the difference between actual wins and expected wins. This’ll cover the completed seasons, between 2002 – 2014. 
 

 
It’s clearly a strong relationship. Clutch doesn’t explain everything , but it explains an awful lot, and that’s just intuitive. Of course the teams that do the best at the right times will be more successful. If they do better than they usually do at the right times, they’ll look like an over-achiever. That’s how you can get a team to win more games than you’d think just based on the overall statistics. 
 
Clutch can turn a mediocre team into a playoff team. Clutch can also turn a would-be playoff team into a mediocre team. Because it’s so important, it stands to reason teams would try to emphasize clutch performance, if they could. They’d try to gather clutch performers. There’s not a single analyst in the world who doubts the significance of clutch events. But that isn’t the problem. Let me show you some more information. We’ve got team batting Clutch, team starter Clutch, and team reliever Clutch. I decided to look at the window from between 2000 – 2014, splitting seasons by first and second halves. Here’s how batting Clutch has carried over, half to half: 
 

 
An r-squared of literally 0.00. You can find numbers that aren’t 0 if you go to more decimals, but that doesn’t accomplish anything. It’s a nothing relationship. Here’s how starter Clutch has carried over, half to half: 
 

 
An r-squared of literally 0.00. You get the point already, but let’s move on to reliever Clutch: 
 

 
An r-squared of literally 0.00. So this won’t surprise you — putting it all together for team Clutch: 
 

 
An r-squared of literally 0.00. No observed relationship. No observed hint of a relationship. The only relationship here is the one between Clutch and total randomness, and that’s not a relationship for anyone to rely upon. It would be one thing if there were no relationship between Clutch in Year 1 and Year 2 (and there isn’t). But this is looking at the same teams, within seasons. Even clutch teams are only temporarily clutch. Sometimes they remain clutch, but no less often do they do the opposite. 
 
This is why I’m more down on, say, the Twins than other people might be. Not that it matters at this point, with the season almost over, but there’s trusting the Twins’ record, and there’s trusting the Twins’ other, underlying numbers. The underlying numbers have proven more trustworthy. If you want to argue a certain team is innately clutch or unclutch, that’s fine. Make the argument. You might very well be right. Just, understand what the argument is up against. Understand how hard it’ll be to convince someone of legitimate clutchness. The argument against this stuff is strong, and it’s tough to doubt a 0.00 r-squared. Factors you might think lend themselves to better or worse performance in clutch situations — there’s nothing convincing in the recent history. And teams would have a lot to gain from harnessing this. 
 
The position is one against clutchness, because that’s what all the evidence points to. It’s not coming out of stubbornness. It’s not coming out of closed-mindedness. It’s just that nothing else has been sufficiently convincing. And, this is important — analysts would probably love to be wrong! It would be amazing if real clutchness could be proven. That would be a breakthrough, and if you’re just some person doing research, good research could get you hired by a club. It would be greatly significant if one could demonstrate reasons for under- or over-achieving, ahead of time. I think we’d all love to read that article. It would change the way we see the game. 
 
That just isn’t where we are today. Today, it looks like near or total randomness. So it gets treated as such, and though the actual wins matter more than the expected wins do, as far as the World Series is concerned, one should understand why sometimes analysts think the expected wins are more meaningful, analytically. We’re always trying to drown out the noise.",e4f330b7-b0e1-4dcf-badb-bb45a3df21dd,Blog,2015-09-15T20:29:37Z,FanGraphs Baseball,Why We Feel How We Feel About Clutch,1.0,News
2153,"Cambridge's commuting belt is now one of the biggest in the country – prompting fresh questions about the value of its green belt. 

The city's reach for drawing in workers now stretches as far down as the M25 to places like Bishop's Stortford, Harlow and Ware, according to new Government analysis. 

The Office of National Statistics has updated its so-called travel to work areas. 

It does this by using an algorithm that maps the country out by areas where 75 per cent of residents live in the area and work in the area, and likewise where 75 per cent of workers work in the area and also live in the area. 
  
This means these areas ignore the usual administrative boundary. 

And Cambridge has seen an explosion in this area over the past 10 years, absorbing the areas that were once centred around Harlow and Bishop's Stortford. 

This means Cambridge is now the regional capital for more than 1,000 square miles. 

""This is a reminder that neighbouring places are more inter-dependent, economically, than many political leaders would care to admit,"" said Jonathan Schifferes in a blogpost for the specialist urban publication City Metric. 



Travel to work areas for 2011 (above) and 2001 (below) 



""In part, the shape of the map also shows us some of the failures of policies of the past. 

""When green belts were introduced, just one in seven households had access to a car: today it's 80 per cent. 

""By constraining housing growth immediately around Oxford and Cambridge, in particular, green belts explain the large travel-to-work areas for these cities, as thousands of commuters drive across each city's green belt to get to work each day. 

""This somewhat defeats the original rationale: green belts simply displace, rather than prevent sprawl.""

2961,"Brig P K Langar (Retd) 
The Armed Forces is a profession of Arms which is nobler than any contemporary profession, for its ethos revolves around the fact that one is to lay down one’s life in line of duty to maintain the territorial sanctity of the nation. The Defense personnel are divorced from the niceties of the civil environments and are motivated and trained to get the better of the enemy in combat, both in peace and war, should the contingency arise. Military personnel are ‘Karam Yogi’ , whose Dharm is their duty to carry out assigned task in an extraordinary self less attitude. The ‘Izzat’ of their Unit and the Country is uppermost in their minds and they live and die to maintain its sanctity. 
Age old traditions and un-written laws which keeps morale of the soldiers high all through their active service and after retirement, assures them that the state would look after their interest when the times comes. This bond between the soldier and the State, and their faith in their superiors and vis-a-versa remain unfettered forever. This is the main reason that they reconcile with that fact that their Fundamental Rights ( So dear to their fellow countrymen) are curtailed by their respective Service Acts. The soldiers don’t voice their grievances in public even when they are not satisfied in their promotion prospects and the like.  This reinforces the fact that the State has to look after their well being religiously in a most effective manner. The day it does not happen and a Soldier has to demand for his legitimate dues, the incumbent Government would lose its credibility which could have serious ramifications in future. 
The case of One Rank One Pension (OROP) is very legitimate since the sustainability of the present and tomorrows ex-servicemen depends on implementation of OROP. To comprehend that the citizen and the Government must appreciate that the Armed Forces have a steep pyramid for promotion with no lateral expansion hence most of the officers and the Other Rank of the Defence forces retire between ages from late 30s to early 40s and are on pension to lead a decent life and cater to growing children’s requirements. The jobs offered by commercial organization are not in consonance with the status  of ex-servicemen and are often demeaning. 
The political leadership over the last 40 years has shown a lackadaisical attitude towards the soldiers demand by not implementing OROP in its totality. It’s fair to assume that the political leadership is influenced by the bias of bureaucracy, the latter caught in its own web of ulterior motives.  The ex-servicemen out of frustration for not getting their legitimate dues are on a peaceful protest and hunger strike for about 90 days. The Government while implementing OROP should not get involved in bargaining with the ex-servicemen, for it is not akin to a strike of by Labour Union of a PSU. If the implementation of OROP is further delayed it can lead to a fissure between political and military leadership which will be unfortunate and could impact working equation between the two in future. 
The political leadership is supreme in a democratic set up but it has to take military leadership on board to ensure turmoil free domestic constituency and maintaining sanctity of national borders and safety from external aggression. A powerful military force with high morale is inevitable in guarding national interest and asset, both inside and outside the country. Also a motivated strong military force is an extension of economically developed nation’s aggressive policy helping it to become a dominating nation in the world affairs. 
It’s on record that whenever the incumbent Government demanded, the Armed Forces Commanders had advised the former on the best military course of action and carried out the assigned task relentlessly to safeguard the sovereignty and integrity of the country. The Kashmir operation 1947-48, to throw back the Pakistani intruders, a strong repost to cripple Pakistani military machine in 1965 war, the liberation of Bangladesh to stop the oppressed refugees influx into our country and the Kargil Operation of 1999 are all examples in point and are testimony to the fine synergy between the civil and military leadership of the day. In all the above scenarios the bureaucracy was only in a support role and will remain the same in future also. 
We must appreciate objectively that today’s serviceman is tomorrow’s ex-serviceman and whatever be the final decision of the Government on implementation of OROP, it will impact the psyche of the future generations of the Armed Forces. 
Finally, the implementation of OROP is a political decision which rests duly on elected leaders of the day, who have the mandate to look after the welfare of its people and the Armed Forces. We hope that the undulated implementation of the OROP will satisfy and upkeep the honour of  the protesting ex-serviceman, who were front line soldiers yesterday and had fought the Righteous war to safe guard the honour, safety and welfare of the people of this country at the peril of their own lives.

1693,"NBC have given a green light for a ‘Brides Of Dracula’ pilot with a view to it going to full series. The drama is to be produced and written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa & Greg Berlanti. The concept behind the series asks what if Dracula’s Brides had survived for centuries after the slaying of their Vampire master and now reside in New York city. Written by Aguirre-Sacasa, Brides is described as a sexy reimagining of Dracula as a family drama with a trio of strong, diverse female leads, a show about empowered women and the things they do to maintain wealth, prestige, legacy — and their non-traditional family. The project hails from Warner Bros. Television and studio-based Berlanti Prods., with Aguirre-Sacasa, Berlanti and Berlanti Prods.’ Sarah Schechter executive producing. Known in popular culture as the Brides of Dracula, the three characters, originally introduced in Bram Stoker’s classic novel, are portrayed as beautiful and powerful female vampire “sisters” who reside with Count Dracula in his castle in Transylvania where they use their charm to seduce and bewitch men before preying on them. In the book the brides managed to seduce Van Helsing who just about manages to shake off their spell and kills them. The brides have been a strong staple in the ‘Dracula’ mythology since the very start and have appeared in numerous movies before headlining in the 1960s in the film ‘Brides Of Dracula’.  ",7db85611-9b19-43df-bd28-75b64a9f5327,Blog,2015-09-03T09:30:26Z,SciFi Pulse,‘Brides of Dracula’ Series Lands At NBC,1.0,Blog
2091,"Pictured: England coach Stuart Lancaster 

Stuart Lancaster accepts the visit of Wales and Australia to Twickenham over the next two weekends will define his stewardship as England's World Cup enters a critical phase. 

The magnitude of Saturday's Pool A showdown with Warren Gatland's men was vast even before Lancaster dropped the selection bombshell of demoting George Ford at fly-half in favour of Owen Farrell and picking Sam Burges at inside centre. 

But the radical overhaul of England's midfield after Jonathan Joseph was stricken by a chest injury, including the fielding of the 14th centre pairing of Lancaster's reign in Burgess and Brad Barritt, has added a new dimension to a match already billed as the biggest in the old rivals' long history. 
 
Lancaster has been accused of gambling and abandoning his attacking philosophy shaped around the vision of Ford at a decisive moment in his three and a half year reign and while he denies the claims, he is aware his reputation is on the line. 
 
When asked if the evaluation of his tenure hinged on the outcome against Wales, he replied: ""It was always going to be the case for this game and the one against Australia. 
 
""Clearly the selection has heightened it. If we win the game it will be judged a success. If we lose the game regardless of what selection I made, I'd be questioned. 
 
""It will come down ultimately to the next two games. I understand the consequences and the stakes because it's the World Cup."" 
 
Of all the collisions looming at Twickenham on Saturday evening, it is the wince-inducing battle between 17-stones centres Burgess and Jamie Roberts that is the most anticipated. 
 
It has been 11 months since Burgess switched codes and after only 112 minutes of Test rugby comprising of a solitary start and two substitute appearances, he must duel with a two-tour British and Irish Lion in possession of 73 caps. 
 
On paper it is a mismatch, but Lancaster is banking on Burgess' ""big game experience"" in league to help him nullify Welsh battering ram Roberts while imposing his own power in attack.",714317c4-56a5-4ee0-83b1-d78e3a4799d4,News,2015-09-25T06:31:20Z,Bailiwick Express,Stuart Lancaster realises enormity of Wales and Australia World Cup matches,0.0,News

863,"(Reuters) - Private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC [WP.UL] said on Monday it has agreed to lead a $60 million investment round in Civitas Learning, an Austin, Texas-based startup that uses data analytics to help universities improve graduation rates.

Education software and services companies have drawn record levels of investment this year, as many institutions are seeking to upgrade their learning tools to become more competitive in attracting and educating students.

This was the largest funding round to date for Civitas, which was founded in 2011 by former Kaplan education executive Charles Thornburgh and an educator and administrator, Mark David Milliron.

Universities and colleges that use Civitas give the company access to information from its student population such as grades, course loads, and financial aid packages. The company then analyzes the data and creates a system of predictive analytics to help universities figure out who might be at risk of dropping out.

It also builds applications on top of its data platform that can help students pick majors, and analyzes for university administrators the effectiveness of courses.

Civitas generates revenue by selling software subscriptions. About 850 campuses use its services, including the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Arizona, according to its website.

Adarsh Sarma, managing director at Warburg Pincus, in a statement said Civitas was ""a pioneer in the field of using applied data analytics to improve student outcomes.""

As state- and federal-funded universities face performance-based funding requirements in which graduation rates are increasingly tied to their budgets, companies like Civitas can be brought in to seek improved results.

""With this investment, we are going to be able to improve and accelerate both learning and student outcomes for our partner institutions,"" said Thornburgh, Civitas' chief executive.

CANNES, France and NEW YORK, June 29, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Grace Sobey and Charlie Clinton of Unilever in the United Kingdom won the Gold Lion for the sixth-annual Young Lions Marketers Competition at the 62nd annual Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. Sponsored by Ketchum, this year's competition challenged 18 teams of young, in-house marketers from around the world to develop a creative brief for a product or service that would benefit Water Aid, an international NGO dedicated to improving access to safe water, hygiene and sanitation in the world's poorest communities.

Sobey agreed and added, ""This is the best thing that has ever happened in my career, and I genuinely mean that.""

The team from the Dominican Republic, Banco BHD León's Letizia Cantarella and Paola Ramos, won the Silver Lion, and the Bronze Lion went to the team from Turkey, Unilever's Nilay Gözegir and Gizem Erbas.

Of the judging, Rafferty said, ""These 36 competitors represent the best and the brightest young in-house marketers from around the world. It is incredibly inspiring to see how committed they are to using their talent to deliver truly creative, strategic ideas for such an important cause. I believe these future leaders of our industry will play a big role in helping to make our world a better place.""

5590,"It’s a holiday Monday and Scott decided he didn’t want to come home to do his weekly post. Can you believe he’d choose extra vacation over a WFNY post? I know! The nerve. So you get some more of me this week. 
 After a weekend of college football we’re still waiting for the game…  
I hope the wait is worth it for Buckeyes fans and followers. It was torturous to watch a whole weekend of college football knowing that I had to wait until Monday night for the Buckeyes to finally get their season underway on Monday night. Another day of waiting to find out that J.T. Barrett (probably) will be the starter. Another day of listening to all those other teams talk about their team and what they looked like. Just waiting and anticipating and hoping that the game goes exactly how we want it to go with a Buckeyes victory wire to wire. 
 
It’s especially scary because the Buckeyes are the number one team and they’ve got a target on their back. They also have one on their front and bottom and top and any other direction you can think of. That’s the difficult thing about being the favorite. It’s the thing that accentuates the journey that the team is about to embark on, and that’s the same feeling I had after the Cavaliers finished the season. What? You mean we have to go through this all over again? 
 
The journey is fun and it’s worthwhile whether you win it all like the Buckeyes or just fall short like the Cavaliers, but it’s kind of exhausting just the same. The Buckeyes will hopefully keep the scares to an absolute minimum. That’s probably too much to ask. This is football and it’s just not an easy thing to win every game and do so convincingly every single time. 
 
Welcome back college football. Welcome back sports anxiety. 
 Terrance West must be kind of a difficult or immature guy…  
If you just look at the production and potential, there’s no way you should ever read Terrance West’s name in trade rumors first, and ultimately traded to the Titans. But that’s exactly where the Browns’ second-year running back finds himself right now . It makes you wonder what the Browns are thinking. 
 
Obviously, they must like Isaiah Crowell and Duke Johnson, but those factors alone don’t eliminate the need for a young guy with some potential. That’s where you have to wonder if there’s something else going on. West shows potential, so you wouldn’t think he’s a guy who is out of shape. The Browns did struggle with him in terms of getting him on the practice field and off of the exercise bike. There are also plenty of rumblings that indicate he lacks maturity. Short of the Browns being on “Hard Knocks” there’s no telling what the running backs room is like. 
 
So all you can do is look at the resulting chatter and deduce a conclusion. Terrance West must be conducting himself in some kind of way that makes him undesirable for the Browns to continue to work with. Regardless, a week before the Browns head into their first real action of the year, it’s less than ideal to have an extra piece of the team so up in the air. If they had trouble with Terrance West to the point they considered trading him, imagine what it will be like to work with him after they fail to get a deal done. 
 The most embarrassing song to ever randomly come into your head…  
I’m putting myself out there this holiday Monday morning. I had a song pop into my head yesterday randomly at the grocery store, and it didn’t even come over the speakers in the store. Some other song that I didn’t know gave me flashbacks to this one, and I had a strangely fond memory of it to the point that I had to hear it. I don’t like this song – at least I don’t think I do – but I just had to hear it anyway. I told my wife about it because it was so embarrassing to me, and now I’m telling you too, because, why not? 
 
So now you have to share too. What’s the worst, most embarrassing song that ever popped into your head and then you just had to hear it? 
 

 The Wonder Years and the emo revival…  
I don’t know what bands this new crop grew up listening to, but hard indie rock and / or emo is in some kind of revival and for this 36-year-old it’s bringing me back to the best music of the early 2000’s. I don’t know if Andrew already posted this or not, and frankly, I don’t care because even if he did I’m posting it too. I have to talk about these kinds of bands because they do the exact things I love most in music. They sing at the top of their ranges, they like loud-soft-loud dynamics, and they play with the kind of dedication and emotion that gives music the sense of urgency I love. I can’t wait to see this band play live.

610,"The man who bludgeoned Irish student Karen Buckley to death with a spanner and attempted to dispose of her body in a vat of chemicals has been jailed for a minimum of 23 years. 

Alexander Pacteau, 21, was branded “truly evil” after admitting the crime at the High Court in Glasgow last month. 



Judge Lady Rae today sentenced him to 23 years for the murder of the 24-year-old, who was on a night out with friends in April when she was murdered by Pacteau. 

Lady Rae said Pacteau had carried out a “brutal, motiveless attack on a defenceless young woman”. 

She continued: ""I find it extremely difficult to find words appropriate to describe the dreadful crime to which you pleaded guilty. 

“Karen Buckley was a young woman in the prime of life. She was a visitor to Glasgow, studying to expand her knowledge in furtherance of her career in nursing. She was a much loved member of a close and united family. 

""To you she was a stranger who appeared tragically to have accepted a lift in your car. Within a matter of minutes, for some inexplicable reason, you destroyed her young life and devastated a family."" 



The judge said Pacteau had gone to “extraordinary lengths” to conceal what he had done and told a “tissue of lies” and a ""concoted story"" to police investigating her disappearance. 

In delivering her sentence she said: ""You now, through your counsel, claim to be remorseful. Remorse was, however, only expressed for the first time when you pleaded guilty. 

""From a perusal of the criminal justice social work report, it is apparent that in the course of your lengthy interviews with the social worker, at no time did you ever demonstrate or express any regret for what you had done. 

""That expression of remorse on 11 August might have carried more weight if communicated earlier. And it is difficult, in my view, to envisage someone who is truly sorry for killing another human being, going to the lengths to which you went to cover up your appalling crime, whilst making up false stories about the deceased."" 

Miss Buckley’s parents John and Marian travelled from Cork to see Pacteau plead guilty on August 11 and were in court again today. 

Previous conviction 

The qualified nurse had only been in Glasgow for a few months before her killing. 

She had recently left her job at an Essex hospital and moved to Scotland to study for a masters degree in occupational health therapy at Glasgow Caledonian University. 

Miss Buckley was described as an outgoing woman whose life revolved around her family and friends. 

Pacteau, who described himself as a “self-employed sales consultant”, has a previous conviction for printing counterfeit money. 

It emerged after his conviction that he stood trial in 2013 at the High Court in Paisley accused of attempting to rape a woman in a Glasgow lane. He was found not guilty of the charge. 

In the early hours of April 12, he met Miss Buckley outside the Sanctuary nightclub and drove her to nearby Kelvin Way, where he grabbed her neck and delivered about a dozen blows with a spanner. 

The killer visited various shops to purchase caustic soda before placing her body in the bath at his flat. 

On trips to High Craigton Farm on the outskirts of the city, he burned a mattress and clothes before buying a barrel, placing Miss Buckley’s body inside and locking it in a storage unit he had rented. 

Pacteau initially claimed to detectives, who identified him from CCTV footage, that they went back to his flat and she had fallen and injured herself on the bed frame. 

His solicitor John Scullion QC said he could offer no ”rational explanation” for his actions.",d0aecccd-2411-4059-a1ca-f686419dffaf,News,2015-09-08T09:54:05Z,Irish Examiner,"Judge: Karen Buckley's murder was a 'brutal, motiveless attack on a defenceless young woman'",0.0,News
108,"West Brom have rejected a third bid from Tottenham for Saido Berahino, Press Association Sport understands. 
 
The offer, which arrived late on Tuesday, was only marginally better than Spurs' previous bid, which would have only risen to £21million with clauses and add-ons. 
 
The Baggies have instantly dismissed Tottenham's third approach and remain determined to keep the England Under-21 striker at The Hawthorns. 
 
Berahino had a transfer request rejected last month with Albion angered by Tottenham's continued pursuit of the 22-year-old.

Scannapieco, 71, admitted to detectives that he had sexual contact with a female child relative 50 to 60 times between 2006 and 2008, reports the Asbury Park Press. The sexual abuse began when the girl was six, reports Delaware Online. The now-teen girl told her mother in June 2014 about the abuse while she was younger. In May, he pleaded guilty to pleaded guilty to the repeated sexual abuse of a child, first-degree rape and unlawful sexual contact in the first degree. Scannapieco was the mayor of Marlboro, in Monmouth County, from 1992 to 2003. He was also an honorably discharged veteran. The abuse mostly stopped after Scannapieco went to prison for taking about $245,000 in bribes from New Jersey developers, but he reportedly admitted to 'touching' her once after his release from prison in 2010. Scannapieco's sketchy past includes collecting bribes for the then-mayor to push multiple projects through the township's planning board.

The ex-mayor is now awaiting sentencing in Delaware, where the crimes happened, on the rape charges.

Andrew Rosen, says that Scannapieco is 'disgusted with himself,' and that he doesn't fit the profile of the typical pedophile - he had no child porn in his home and his lawyer says there are no other victims. 'He wanted to take responsibility and not put her through anything more,' Rosen told Daily Mail Online of Scannapieco's decision to plead guilty.  His plea means he can ask for no less than 15 years in prison but prosecutors can ask for no more than 25. 'He has hopes he will get out of prison someday,' Rosen said, despite the ex-mayor's advanced age.  Rosen says it's baffling how the ex-mayor and former veteran went from high-regarded to bribe taker and admitted pedophile: 'I can't even imagine his mental state when that stuff happened.'   Scannapieco remains in custody on $238,500 bond, is scheduled for sentencing on September 4 at the New Castle Superior Court in Wilmington, according to NJ.com.

1828,"( Family Features ) It’s time for sandwiches to move aside, because this school year bento-box style lunches reign king on campus. Bento boxes provide not only the space for healthy and nutritious food choices, but also creativity. Isn’t it time for lunch to be more fun? 
  
Nutrition blogger and mom of two, Sally Kuzemchak, uses Lil Snappers kid-sized fruit when she creates bento box lunches because they are easy for little students to hold, serving size proportionate and each 3-pound pouch provides enough fruit for lunches and snacks for an entire week. On top of that, the fruit can be sliced up for dipping in almond butter or yogurt sprinkled with cinnamon or cut up into a fruit salad, perfect for the three or four compartments in a bento box. 
 
Studies indicate healthy eating can influence the cognitive ability and intelligence levels of students, and balanced midday meals of fruits, proteins, carbohydrates and healthy fats are best. For a well-rounded lunch, parents can fill bento boxes with fresh pasta alongside sliced carrots and grapes, taco fixings with a Lil Snappers apple or a fun and creative meal-on-a-stick to keep school-aged children satisfied throughout the day. 
 
Preparing healthy, filling lunches shouldn’t be difficult, and with bento-box style meals your kids will never be bored. With a little preparation and recipe inspiration, crafting back to school lunches will be a breeze.

Using small teaspoon or grape¬fruit spoon, core-out center of each apple base (working outward from centermost part of fruit), leaving 1/4-inch outer edge; set aside. In small bowl, mix tuna, mayonnaise, mustard and carrot. Season to taste. Spoon 1/4 cup of tuna salad into each apple, top with top one-third of apples, tilted slightly to resemble a chest being opened. Use playful, pirate-themed cupcake holders and flagged toothpicks to make for fun presentation and easy clean-up.

5392,"Even though the autumnal equinox is a few weeks away, I'm already aware of the shorter days. When I get up early, the sun isn't up yet. And all too often, dusk has fallen before I complete my errands. And it will get worse in the months ahead.I find that the shorter days make me want to hibernate, so I have to adjust my routine a bit.It's time to start leaving an outside light on when you go to work (if you don't have motion detection light) and to set a timer on an inside light so that you don't come home to a dark house.I hate waking up to darkness. It's a lot harder for me to get moving when it's still dark outside. So I try to do more of my morning chores in the evening, so I can afford to stay in bed a bit longer.You may need to alter your routine so that you can use the limited daylight as efficiently as possible. For example, do all of your indoor chores (laundry, ironing, unloading the dishwasher, vacuuming, etc.) at night. That way, you have the limited light before and after work and on the weekends to do outdoor chores and to get out and enjoy the fall weather.As the light grows less, I find it harder to make time to run outside. I just don't have much daylight after work and I need to walk the dog. (Picking up dog poop by flashlight is not fun.) So, I will sometimes do a short run (interval training anyone?) immediately after work so  can get home when there's still twilight. I save my longer runs for weekends. Or I have to get myself to the gym since it's always well-lit there.Ultimately, there won't be enough light for even a short evening run or dog walk. That makes it a good idea to invest in a good flashlight or head lamp, a reflective vest, and other safety equipment.If you organize your time well, you can make the best possible use of these shorter days -- even if you wish you could hibernate!",d2c3c330-f073-485c-a7ac-c471a5ec1b0d,Blog,2015-09-10T16:33:00Z,The Elf Blog,Shorter Days,1.0,News
438,"European stock markets recovered their poise Tuesday despite an earlier rout in Asia which featured a 4 percent slide in Japan's main index. 

KEEPING SCORE: In Europe, Germany's DAX rose 0.2 percent to 9,504 while the CAC-40 in France was steady at 4,357. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares underperformed its main European counterparts, trading 0.5 percent lower at 5,929. U.S. stocks were poised for a solid opening with Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures up 0.5 percent. 

SOUR COCKTAIL: Over recent days, worries over China have resurfaced, not least in the impact the slowdown in the world's number 2 is having on commodity prices, many of which have fallen to multiyear lows. On Monday, commodities group Glencore saw its share price tank by around a third amid concerns over its ability to service its debts if commodity prices don't rise. The fallout from Volkswagen's emissions rigging scandal also remains with investors unsure of the impact on the industry. Fed officials, meanwhile, continue to signal they will raise U.S. interest rates this year, marking the beginning of the end of ultra-low interest rates that have underpinned stock markets. 

ANALYST TAKE: ""At the risk of saying 'It's that time of year,' bearing in mind the timing of historical equity market crashes in September or October, there is no doubt that a confluence of events is unsettling investors,"" said Neil MacKinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital. 

GLENCORE BOUNCE: One of the reasons why the market mood has improved is that Glencore has seen its share price bounce back 6 percent from Monday's hammering. On Tuesday, analysts at Citibank said the fall in Glencore's share price — about 80 percent from its high in May — has been ""overdone"" and suggested the company could raise more money from the sale of investments than the $2 billion it has penciled in. Citibank analysts also said Glencore management could consider taking the company back into private hands. 

ASIA'S DAY: The calmer backdrop in Europe was not anticipated after the earlier rout in Asia, which followed Monday's big down day on Wall Street. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped 4.1 percent to 16,930.84 while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined 3.8 percent to 4,918.40. Hong Kong's Hang Seng ended down 3.0 percent at 20,556.60 while the Shanghai Composite in mainland China shed 2.0 percent to close at 3,038.14. 

ENERGY: Benchmark crude rose 47 cents to $44.90 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent Crude, a benchmark for international oils, was up 53 cents to $47.87. 

CURRENCIES: The euro was down 0.2 percent at $1.1225 while the dollar fell 0.1 percent to 119.83 yen.",4f802018-0e59-4e94-a45f-bd2858d71049,News,2015-09-29T13:48:07Z,Wichita Eagle,US stocks are stable in early trade; energy sector gains,0.0,News

Copy Editor With the clock ticking down until Oct. 13, the last day for voter registration, a number of ODU student organizations are making it their goal to register as many student voters as possible. On Nov. 3, Virginia will be holding elections for numerous seats in both houses of the state legislature. On Tuesday, Sept. 22, ODU’s Student Government Association led by example. During their “SGA Day” event, each committee of the student government operated a booth that informed students about their individual roles and missions. The committee for Legislative Affairs and Diversity used theirs to inform students about the upcoming election, test their general knowledge of voting and register students to vote. Rachael Edmonds, director of the committee, quizzed students about elections and voting, handing out t-shirts for correct answers. Monique Williams, another member of the committee, walked students through the process of registering on a laptop. Together, they helped 250 students learn how to register to vote. They used a system known as TurboVote, which not only aids people in registering to vote, but also sends out alerts via text and email reminding voters of upcoming elections. It can also walk voters through the process, informing them what identification to bring, where their polling place is located and helping to obtain absentee ballots. Other organizations use this program as well, including the ODU College Democrats. “It’s a nice program for letting students know about upcoming elections,” Charles Christie, president of the ODU College Democrats, said. This year, they’ve helped register about 150 students to vote. “It’s good for an off-year election,” Christie said. In the recent weeks, they have set up a table in the main lobby of the Webb Center during activity hour. Many ODU students were not old enough to vote in the 2012 presidential election. The voting process is foreign to them. In addition, a great deal of them are unaware that an election is even occurring this year. “Some of them, I’m confused when they don’t know,” Williams said, referring to the number of students who could not answer the general election questions. Some of the questions included naming the date of the next election, or the name of a candidate. One student at the SGA Day event was aware of the Nov. 3 elections, and planned to vote absentee. “We have a small town,” Elizabeth Heath, a sophomore, said, noting that she personally knew some of the local candidates. However, she said that she didn’t know much about the state-level candidates. “The media that most people engage with is national, so not a lot of people know about these smaller Virginia state elections,” Christie said. “What really affects you most are these small decisions in Richmond.” In addition to helping students register to vote, he’s encouraged students to get involved in the campaigns. So far, he’s helped students become volunteers or interns with three different campaigns. The College Democrats are also hosting phone banking events for some of the campaigns before the presidential debates. They provide scripts, and teach students how to campaign for candidates over the phone. “It’s one big democratic call-fest,” Christie said. Another student organization, the National Association of Blacks in Criminal Justice, will be hosting multiple voter registration events in the month of October. The biggest obstacle to encouraging students to vote in off-year elections is the lack of information and general sense of apathy. “If you want a progressive president with a progressive agenda, they can only be as successful as states allow them to be,” Christie said. “The progressive policies can or can’t happen depending on how involved you are in the years leading up to an election.”    ",50b6542e-7a3f-4c6c-ab73-170ba7fd964d,Blog,2015-09-27T03:44:33Z,Mace & Crown,Student Organizations Encourage Voter Registration,1.0,News

625,"As of August, the average rate for equity release lifetime mortgages had fallen to a record low of 5.82 per cent, according to Age Partnership.

This has dropped from the average rate of 6.70 per cent seen in 2009, when Age Partnership started tracking rates (see graph 1).

Analysis of Age Partnership’s management information looked at over 21,000 equity release customers from the last seven.

Average property prices in the UK have reached a record high of £272,000, according to ONS data, which means the average housing wealth of home-owning over-55s is likely to have increased significantly.

Graph 1: Average house prices and average rates for equity release lifetime mortgages since 2009

Source: ONS house price data and Age Partnership’s management information

Simon Chalk, equity release expert at Age Partnership, commented: “In the last seven years, the fortunes of Britain’s mature homeowners have truly turned around. Whereas 2009 saw house prices falling in the wake of the recession, we are now seeing house prices reach new peaks, as healthy demand for homes fuels property price growth.

“Simultaneously, equity release lifetime mortgage rates have fallen sharply, meaning the plans on offer are appealing to more homeowners seeking a bit of extra income or a lump cash sum than ever before.

“The number of providers offering equity release plans has also widened, and with trusted household names like Legal & General launching earlier this year, customers are enjoying some of the most competitive deals we’ve ever had.

Mature customers benefit from lower rates

The data also shows that rates have reduced amongst all ages of equity release customers, with mature customers particularly benefitting.

Age Partnership’s average 65 year old customer currently has a rate of 5.95 per cent, compared to a customer 10 years older who benefits from a lower rate of 5.74 per cent. However, both ages have seen a drop in rates to record lows since 2009 when rates were over 6.60 per cent (see graph 2).

Graph 2: Average rates for 65 year old and 75 year old customers since 2009

Rising property prices are helping to balance out the interest paid

House price growth is helping to counteract the interest owed for taking out an equity release plan, meaning equity release customers can hang onto more of the equity in their house for longer.

Looking at the typical Age Partnership customer this year to date, they have on average released £43,972 at an average fixed rate of 5.82 per cent on a property worth £252,951. By releasing less than 20 per cent of the value of their home, compared to an average maximum available of 34 per cent, they are evidently being sensible, taking just enough to meet whatever their needs may be.

As the research table below shows, a realistic 2 per cent house price growth assumption each year will ensure they have over 80 per cent of the remaining equity left to leave to loved ones when they die.

If house prices were to rise at 2 per cent a year – much lower than the current annual growth of 5.7 per cent – the average property value would have risen to £320,803 by 2027.

Over the same time, the size of the equity owed would have risen to £86,694. However, this would leave total remaining equity of £234,109, up from £208,979 initially, showing the equity owned in the house would not be eroded in monetary terms. This can be seen in the table below.

478,"Psychologists have identified a mental glitch that exposes us financially. Photo: Robert Zuckerman Touchstone Pictures and Jerry Bruckheimer, Inc.  Source: Supplied  
        
 THOUSANDS of struggling Australians are trapped in a debt vortex with cards maxed out and no way of getting out of the red.  
   
The Consumer Action Law Centre’s financial counselling helpline receives more than 5000 calls a year from people struggling with credit card debt, with 50 per cent facing bills of more than 

$10,000. 

“Every week, we hear from someone with credit card debt exceeding $100,000,” said the centre’s policy officer Katherine Temple told the Federal Government’s credit card inquiry, which held its second hearing in Melbourne yesterday. 

And it’s not just the vulnerable or uneducated who are at risk of being sucked in, she said; a simple psychological glitch puts us all at risk. 

The “optimism bias” kicks in when we are weighing up our options to make a purchase or financial decision. 
      
 That Gucci bag isn’t going to pay for itself.  Source: Supplied  
    
Put simply, it means that we over-estimate our ability to pay for something in the future if we don’t have to worry about it for the time being. 

It makes us less likely to care about a higher interest rate that will kick in 12 months down the track, or to factor in the possibility that an unforeseen disaster could obliterate our ability to pay. 

“It’s quite calculated,” said Ms Temple. 

“We need structural change, to make sure people aren’t being given credit cards that they can’t afford to repay.” 

Ms Temple said tougher lending rules were needed, to stop banks from heaping massive debt on people who would never be able to pay them off. 

“The optimism bias means that we have a tendency to over-estimate our capacity to pay,” she said. 

“That’s why balance transfers are so attractive — it’s basically free money (in people’s minds).” 

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission acknowledged this phenomenon in its submission to the inquiry, noting: that “people with strong optimism or present biases might begin with the intention of always paying off their balance in full and, based on this intention, may disregard the interest rate on a card in the belief they will not need to pay any interest.” 
     
 If Carrie Bradshaw was real, there’s a fair chance she’d be calling a debt crisis line.  Source: News Corp Australia  
    
Consumer advocates say the banks are taking advantage of human nature, profiting from the mental glitch that leaves us vulnerable. 

Ms Temple said that along with clearer product descriptions, credit card providers should be forced to base their eligibility assessment on whether the customer can pay off the maximum limit in full, to account for consumers’ behavioural biases. 

“At the moment, it’s based on whether you can pay the monthly minimum,” she said. 

“So if something happens — like job loss, or you get sick, or you have a relationship breakdown — you can find yourself in trouble.” 

Like Carl Cavarra, the out-of-work tradie who is facing potential bankruptcy over a $90,000 debt. 

The 34-year-old owes thousands on five different credit cards, on top of a hefty car loan, all approved while he was working fulltime as a bricklayer. 

And while he was able to afford the minimum payments on these debts while employed, a bad turn of luck left him stuck in a debt spiral. 

After seven years of physical labour, the bricklayer suffered a triple hernia that required surgery, bed rest — and left his earning capacity in limbo. 

Despite incurring the injury through repeated heavy lifting on the job, Mr Cavarra said, WorkCover deemed his case one of “wear and tear”, so he received no compensation. 

On doctor’s orders, he abandoned his career, moved back in with his parents and started an unsuccessful 10-month search for a new job. 
     
 Melbourne’s Carl Cavarra is facing potential bankruptcy over his $90,000 debt.  Source: NewsComAu  
    
Unable to make his $1600 monthly loans repayments while living on a $489 a fortnight Centrelink allowance, Mr Cavarra found himself racking up even more debt by putting his living expenses on his credit cards — which have interest rates of between 18 and 23 per cent. 

In the end, the cards were maxed out and the creditors came knocking. 

“I’ve asked to consolidate my debts so I can make one payment, but the banks refuse,” he said. 

“They want it paid off in five years, but that’s impossible.” 

Without a job — despite having applied for hundreds this year — he was not eligible for a balance transfer. 

“I reckon if I don’t find a job by the end of this year, I will have to go bankrupt. I don’t want to do that.” 

It’s this situation that the Consumer Action Law Centre argues should be prevented by more stringent lending rules. 

While it may have been imprudent for Mr Cavarra to saddle himself with so much debt, not giving himself leeway for unforeseen circumstances that could impact his ability to pay, he is far from alone. 

Australians owe a collective $32 billion on their credit cards , with the average card holder paying $700 a year in interest on debts that hover around $4,300. 

And many of them have no idea how much interest rate they are paying; a survey of 2200 credit card users by ME bank found that 73 per cent did not know their interest rate and 40 per cent did not know if their card had an annual fee. 

Inquiry chairman and Labor senator Sam Dastyari accused the banks of running a “confusopoly”, with credit cards marketed in a way that makes it hard for consumers to work out whether they are getting a good deal, amid all the bells and whistles of reward points schemes and promotions. 

Consumer group Choice called for credit card advertising to include the monthly cost for a consumer with an average card balance, in dollars, based on the interest rate and annual fee. 

The credit card inquiry will report its finding to the Senate Economics References Committee by November 24.

A team that features both of the Cubs Minor League Players of the Year in Ryan Williams and Willson Contreras, the Smokies finished 3rd in a prospect-laden Southern League North and just missed out on the playoffs. From my visit there, the Smokies had a free-flowing club house even through a lot of transition. The veterans such as Corey Black and Anthony Giansanti allowed the youngsters, Billy McKinney, Albert Almora Jr. and others, to flawlessly fit in. Smokies Park is also a great place to catch a game, and the view from home plate to center is truly a unique perspective for a ballpark. Now, onto the loaded roster:

Willson Contreras: The Cubs Player of the Year for a position player, Contreras improved his stock more than any other Cubs prospect this year. Signed out of Venezuela for $850,000, Contreras had always been solid defensively before bursting out at the plate this year after a successful Winter League stint. The catcher ended the year with a .333/.413/.478 line and took home the Southern League batting crown. He also had an impressive 10.9% BB% compared to an 11.9% K%, truly a fantastic season at the plate. If he’s able to replicate his line-drive swing and solid defense into AAA next year, a mid-season promotion could be in the cards. Expect him to be a top 5 prospect on many evaluators lists this offseason.

Jeimer Candelario: We all know of his struggles at the High-A level and subsequently Low-A last year, but Candelario put in a lot of work this last off-season to prove he could handle the bump up to High-A. And he passed the test with flying colors. After being promoted from Myrtle Beach 2/3 of the way through the season, Candelario took off when he reached the Smokies. In his 46 game stint with the team, he hit .291/.379/.462, showing an impressive approach at the plate to go along with more power than he showed at Myrtle Beach. Defensively at third he was able to handle himself well, and has soft hands for the position, although he is a little groggy at third. Candelario will certainly move up lists this offseason, and is probably a top 10 prospect after his terrific season. During the season I was able to interview Jeimer which you can find here (http://www.chicagonow.com/cubs-prospect-watch/2015/05/an-interview-with-jeimer-candelario/)

Dan Vogelbach: Injured running to first early in the season, Vogelbach missed a good portion of the year, but still ended up with 81 games to his ledger. With the Smokies he showed a very solid plan at the plate, and continued to hit for impressive power. His OBP ended the year at over .400 (.403) at the AA level which is telling. Although he likely doesn’t have a future with the Cubs, he put together another solid year statistically and is an appealing trade piece for many AL clubs.

Albert Almora Jr.: Very young for the league at just 21, Almora struggled the whole entire first half of the season before coming on strong in the second. He ended the year with a .272/.327/.400 line, which was quite solid considering his poor start. He also hit six bombs, and walked more than twice as much last season. I caught eyes on him in the midst of his slump, and he looked very confused at the plate, flailing at a lot of low off-speed pitches. However, as the season wore on, he began to feel more comfortable in the box and it showed. As always, Almora showed off his impressive defense at center throughout the year, leading many to believe he could be plus out there at the current moment.

Billy McKinney: The Texan continued to do what he has done his whole professional career, hit for average and show an impressive feel at the plate. In 106 games, McKinney ended the year with seven homers and a .300/.371/.454 line across the High-A and AA level. Some evaluators grade out his hit tool as plus, and he has the potential for average power as he gains a little more strength. In the field he doesn’t have the speed for center so is limited to a corner spot, where he should be average defensively. Another productive season for McKinney, who is also likely a top 7 prospect heading into the offseason. I also was able to interview him at Tennessee (http://www.chicagonow.com/cubs-prospect-watch/2015/06/interview-with-billy-mckinney/)

Corey Black: The 24 year-old Californian struggled after his move to the Smokies bullpen, where he showed little command of his plus pitches. Standing at 5’10”, Black is relatively small for a pitcher but understands this and is willing to work low in the zone with his plus fastball and above-average slider. He’s a very level-headed ballplayer, and I think his struggles this year will force him to work even harder this offseason. Hopefully learning to better repeat his release point, which would lead to better command. If he doesn’t take a step forward next season with his control, this could be the end of the line in terms of a prospect for the San Diego native. I was able to conduct my favorite interview of the season with him, which you can find here (http://www.chicagonow.com/cubs-prospect-watch/2015/06/get-to-know-chicago-cubs-top-prospect-corey-black/). He’s a great person and I wish him the best of luck in his journey to the majors.

Pierce Johnson: The Missouri State product once again suffered from a few injuries this year, but he was still able to accumulate 95 innings at the AA level and is going to the AFL for more. Johnson’s ERA was 2.08, though his FIP was 3.47 due to a low 6.82 K/9, among other things. After coming back from injury, he regained his velocity, now sitting in the 91-93mph region and can reach back for more. His fastball and curve still grade out as above-average to plus pitches when he has a consistent release point, and if he irons out his release his control should improve. At the moment, the control is pretty much the only thing keeping him out of the Cubs rotation and he should be in contention of joining it by mid-season next year.

Ryan Williams: An East Carolina graduate, Williams was drafted in the 10th round in 2014 and has proceeded to carve up the minors. The Pitcher of the Year in the minors for the Cubs, Williams posted a 2.16 ERA across two levels while finishing the year with 141.2 innings. The former Pirate has a large and thick base, and has the perfect body for a back-end starter. Williams fastball sits in the low 90’s, and he really attacks hitters with it, trying to get ahead in the count early. His command of the fastball allowed him to easily maneuver through Low-A lineups, and he met a tough test at AA but passed on the back of the pitch. Williams complements the fastball with a slider and 12-6 power curveball in the 82-84mph range. He was able to go deep into starts, and if he continues to get batters out in the upper minors, he should be in contention of joining the Cubs at some point next year.

FROM the World Cup, to the cover of the FIFA 16 video game to Melbourne City.

It’s been a hectic few months for Matildas star Steph Catley.

The Victorian defender on Wednesday became the latest player to defect from Melbourne Victory to new W-League entity City for the upcoming season, following in the footsteps of striker Lisa De Vanna, goalkeeper Brianna Davey, midfielder Beattie Goad and coach Joe Montemurro.

Melbourne City’s men’s team also moved a step closer to completing their squad list ahead of the round one clash away to Sydney FC on October 10, signing former Western Sydney midfielder Jason Trifiro for the 2015-16 season.

The high-profile women’s switches ensure that the first W-League derby at AAMI Park on October 25 will be a heated affair, although the prospect of Matildas matches being played around the same time appears likely to rob the game of some of its starpower.

Catley said, after being approached by Montemurro, she spent months mulling over the decision to move.

“It was a massive decision for me because I’d been at Victory for seven years,” Catley said.

“But I think for me as a player I’m at the stage in my career where I really need to use this year as a development year to grow my game.

“And for me to do that I needed to challenge myself and get myself out of my comfort zone.”

The 21-year-old arrived back in Melbourne on Monday from a stint with American side Portland Thorns and on Wednesday trained at City headquarters after putting pen to paper on a one-year deal.

City, who are away to Sydney in their W-League debut on October 18, will be one of the title favourites even in year one, particularly given the prospect of an influx of international stars still looms large.

“I think it’s always hard for a new team coming in to a league and I think it’s hard to find consistency right away,” she said.

“But we’ve already got such a good base of players who are willing to work hard ... and everyone’s hungry.”",51cc6ab3-0929-496a-9036-9c982df5da62,News,2015-09-16T14:01:00Z,NEWS.com.au,Matildas star becomes latest City coup,0.0,News

1032,"During last night's Republican presidential debate, moderator Jake Tapper took the opportunity to ask about the bad science espoused by another of his fellow candidates. Specifically, Tapper referenced Donald Trump's history of drawing a (completely false, by the way) connection between vaccination and autism and opened the topic for discussion — whereupon the audience was subjected to a truckload of scientific illiteracy. 
 
More : Dear anti-vaxxers: Stop using autism as a bogeyman 
 
Most disappointing of all was the response from the two medical doctors on the stage. Dr. Ben Carson, to whom the initial question was posed, avoided flat out saying that Trump is wrong and waffled a bit, stating that no connection between vaccination and autism had been proven — and then began digging himself a hole, talking about how only certain vaccines are really important and others aren't such a big deal. Which vaccines are those, Dr. Carson? We're all very curious. Dr. Rand Paul tried to set up a false dichotomy between vaccination and freedom (kids being able to enjoy freedom from measles exposure apparently doesn't register). And of course, the Trump himself doubled down on his anti-vaccine sentiments, insisting that vaccination has caused an autism ""epidemic"" and that the current immunization schedule is somehow dangerous. 
 
The fact is that an autism epidemic does not exist — we simply have better tools to diagnose children now and a broader definition to diagnose them by — and study after study has demonstrated that there is absolutely no link between autism and vaccination. Let's be totally clear on this, in the exact opposite of how the debaters discussed it last night: zero. Zip. Zilch. 
 
More : A Democrat's hilarious reenactment of the second GOP debate 

 
But while vaccines don't cause autism, anti-vaccine sentiment does cause problems. Every person who chooses to not vaccinate after hearing politicians regurgitate scientific untruths is exposing their children to a host of preventable — and often dangerous — diseases. 
 
There were nearly 150 pediatric flu deaths in 2015; is the flu vaccine one of those unimportant ones Carson is suggesting don't really matter? In 2012, 4,000 women died of cervical cancer . Is that no big deal either, even if many of those deaths could have been prevented with the HPV vaccine? And how about the 145,000 deaths caused by measles around the world last year? Most of these deaths occurred in developing nations, but it's disingenuous to suggest that measles deaths should be ruled out here at home, with dropping vaccination rates and surging outbreaks. And short of death, a measles infection can cause pneumonia, encephalitis and brain damage. And those are proven (and frequent) complications, by the way, unlike the imaginary link between vaccination and autism. 
 
More : How to change skeptical parents' minds about vaccines 
 
For a group of people to use a platform this large to espouse wildly inaccurate and dangerous viewpoints is obscene — especially with two doctors who should know better on the stage. It's also not very surprising, if touting anti-vax nonsense happens to be politically expedient. And we're not the only ones who think so: Just ask the American Academy of Pediatrics , which released its own ""please don't pay any attention to these knuckleheads"" statement to counteract all the nonsense spewed on CNN last night, noting: 
   
“There is no ‘alternative’ immunization schedule. Delaying vaccines only leaves a chil​d at risk of disease for a longer period of time; it does not make vaccinating safer. 
 
“Vaccines work, plain and simple. Vaccines are one of the safest, most effective and most important medical innovations of our time. Pediatricians partner with parents to provide what is best for their child, and what is best is for children to be fully vaccinated.” 
   
Parents, don't get your medical information from presidential debates: Get it from the CDC (you know, that organization these candidates want to slash funding to?) or from a doctor who's not running for president. And we can all cross our fingers that maybe four years from now, we'll see a candidate whose platform is to make sure all citizens have at least a fundamental level of scientific literacy.",54f020a6-d62c-4f43-99d4-78a36ce94396,Blog,2015-09-17T15:53:00Z,What's New,Dangerous anti-vaccine comments spin out of control at second GOP debate,1.0,Blog

In 2010 Nicole Schneit aka Air Waves released Dungeon Dots, an album Aquarius Records called ""…pretty much perfect pop music."" For her new album Parting Glances, Schneit enlisted friends from Brooklyn's music community to contribute to the record, including members of Woods, Crystal Stilts, Ava Luna, and Hospitality. Additionally, Jana Hunter of Lower Dens contributes vocals to two songs. The album's title comes from the 1986 film Parting Glances in which Steve Buscemi portrays a gay man navigating the difficulties of being in a relationship in Reagan-era New York. More than just identifying with the story, Schneit is interested in the in the lasting effect of the parting glances we share with strangers in our everyday encounters. She explains ""You see all sorts of physical and emotional traits on the train. From people puking, making out, screaming, crying, laughing, dancing, grooming, etc. We encounter each other in the thick of our complex lives by simply looking at each other all the time. These glances are mundane and fleeting but also powerfully intimate."" The lingering impact of those brief moments seeps into the details and imagery she delivers with energizing hooks and a disarming lack of pretense on Parting Glances.

Social Welfare Minister Ravela Kishore Babu on Tuesday announced a suitable government job for the mother of a 15-year-old dalit student who allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself in Darsi last week.
 
Mr. Kishore Babu, who is also the Minister in-charge of Prakasam district, promised a fair probe into the death of the boy under mysterious circumstances.
 
The Darsi Police, based on a complaint filed by the boy's parents, has already registered a murder case against the School Principal, Physical Science teacher and Physical Education teacher.
 
Later in the day, the Minister also gave Rs. 1 lakh compensation each to the family members of the four persons who were struck dead by lightning in the district during the recent rains.

CHANDIGARH: Punjab Congress will demand a CBI inquiry into alleged delay in disbursal of post-matric scholarships for scheduled caste students in the state. Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Sunil Jakhar said details of the scholarships procured by him showed that entire fund received from the Centre had not been passed on to the departments concerned in the same financial year. The Congress will raise the issue in the Punjab assembly session on Thursday.
""Resultantly, students are being made to run from pillar to post seeking what was due to them 3-4 years back. To confuse, the state government has been showing the total amount disbursed in a year and not what was actually received from the Centre. The Centre received Rs 28,081 lakh was under the post-matric scholarship for children from SC category during 2013-14 but the disburse amount for the period was only Rs 3,175 lakh,"" alleged Jakhar.

Tirumala to train dalits, make them priests

TIRUPATI: In a sharp departure from tradition, the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams has decided to train non-Brahmins in temple rituals and practices. About 200 people from dalit and backward communities will be given rigorous training for three months as part of a pilot project. To begin with, the beneficiaries will be selected from Chittoor and West Godavari districts. 
This is the first time that the administration of the world's richest temple is offering a certificate course in Vedic rituals for dalits and backward classes. Earlier, the TTD had conducted several short training sessions for tribal priests in Vedic rituals. But now, the training will be full-fledged with a certificate awarded at the end of the programme. 
""The TTD will train youths from downtrodden sections of society in temple rituals. We will focus on people living in remote and backward areas. The endowments department, in association with the TTD, will also build temples in far-flung villages. Once the training session is over, these youths will be handed over the task of daily rituals in those proposed temples,"" AP endowments minister P Manikyala Rao said. 
The TTD had earlier launched a similar initiative, Dalita Govindam, to spread the Hindu Dharma in Dalit hamlets by training the youths in offering 'prasadam' to the deity. ""It was a week-long programme. They were simply trained in offering 'prasadam' and a couple of rituals. There was no follow-up action either. Now we will take up a comprehensive training program,"" said an official in the endowments department. The TTD will conduct the certificate program in Sri Venkateswara Vedic University. 
According to TTD officials, 'Agamas' (traditional doctrine for temple ritual) are of three types. While the highest form of these rituals is practised by traditional priests, the other two forms can be performed by the general public. 
As part of the certificate program, about 100 youth each from West Godavari and Chittoor districts will be trained in 'Smartha' traditions. Smartha deals with all types of common rituals in a family including fixing muhurthams for weddings. The training programme will focus on the general tenets of the Vedic religion, evolution of temple system, the dos and don'ts of idol worship and rituals, and conduct of festivals among other things. During the training session, the priests-to-be should wake up before the sunrise, perform yoga and recite the prescribed mantras before attending to the classroom. The TTD will, however, not employ the trained youth.

The merits of affirmative action
http://infochangeindia.org/human-rights/analysis/the-merits-of-affirmative-action.html
 
By Meher Gadekar
 
An important pillar of affirmative action in the US has been the preferential allotment of tenders and contracts in the corporate sector to blacks. What have opinion-makers and industry in India done to build a just society for dalits? Most recently,industry turned down the government's request for reservations in the private sector.
 
Over the past few years the debate and discourse on the issue of empowerment of dalits by providing them equal opportunities for their development, and the government's reservations policy, has come under sustained criticism in the mainstream media by the intelligentsia, educationists, industry and other elite who are the major opinion-makers in society. The main argument against the policy of reservations is that merit is being compromised, implying that in the absence of reservations society is governed only by rational, objective, optimal, merit-based decisions that are devoid of nepotism, corruption and ulterior motives. Also implied (though not so obviously) is the hypothesis that merit rests with the so-called ""forward"" castes and communities.
Is there any data/logic to support either of these two hypotheses?
 
What is 'merit'?
According to the Random House Dictionary, merit is ""claim to commendation; excellence; worth"". It is also ""something that entitles a reward or commendation; a commendable quality, act, etc"". In addition, ""it is the state or fact of deserving"". It is also ""that which is well deserved; to be worthy of; deserve"". The word is generally used in a favourable sense and signifies inherent value or goodness.
 
 
Why do dalits (includes scheduled castes and scheduled tribes) lag behind?
 
Dalits lag behind other ""forward"" sections of society for the following reasons:
 
·                     They were deprived of opportunities for development as they lacked opportunities and access to education, employment, etc; they faced discrimination, segregation, untouchability and were looked down upon.
 
·                     Many dalit communities were/are artisans and hence never put a premium on getting an education.
 
·                     Tribal people's culture is governed by principles of reciprocity and redistribution. They do not believe in creating surplus but, rather, live from day-to-day. What they collect, hunt or gather from nature is always within limits. Hence it is sustainable (from a resource utilisation point of view) and does not place a burden on nature. They do not have the concept of privately owning land or waterbodies, or generating profits. They believe in co-existence rather than ""ownership"" or ""control"".
 
·                     Many dalit castes were engaged in occupations (if you can call it that!) like scavenging, flaying the skins of dead carcasses, making shoes, carrying night soil (on their heads!) and other activities considered demeaning and polluting in Indian society and culture. Obviously, getting an education would not help them further their career prospects! Today, for obvious reasons, many communities have given up these vocations.
 
·                     In contemporary India, while untouchability is not overtly practised it has taken newer and more sophisticated forms. Thus, housing societies, cooperative banks, cooperatives, clubs and other membership-based organisations dissuade dalits from gaining membership. Occasionally, dalits do manage to become members of these organisations, but they are exceptions to the norm. In rural areas, efforts to dominate and discriminate against dalits are carried out more vigorously and systematically. Dalits are denied minimum wages, their lands are encroached upon; if they try to assert their rights they may face boycott and segregation. Often, they are threatened and even beaten up. They are hit where it hurts most: their women are threatened, abused, molested and even raped. So what if there is an Act to prevent atrocities against dalits?! This has never been a major deterrent to the more powerful forces of domination, orthodoxy and communalism in rural and semi-urban areas. The incident at Khairlanji is the latest in a long list of such events that take place all over India. It can be surmised from this that India's record vis-Ã -vis the human rights of dalits is not one to be proud of.
 
One way to get ahead of the pack and make progress is to work hard over sustained periods of time, do quality work, and remain motivated to do both over the long run. The dominant (or ""forward"" communities) have found a smarter way to avoid this difficult path with a much simpler alternative. Baptise large sections of society as ""dalit"" and thus devoid of merit and talent. Segregate, discriminate, subjugate, exploit and tread over them for a period of time. This breaks their spirit, their self-respect and self-belief. Perpetuate the myth that merit is intrinsic in a few communities (due to the accident of birth) and create a society which, while grossly violating the human rights of dalits, paves the way for a smooth, hassle-free ride on the expressway of growth, development and wealth for India's elite, the so-called ""forward"" castes.
 
What policy options does the State have? And what is it doing?
The State has the following policy options for developing and empowering dalits:
·                     Provide reservations in education, jobs etc, as is the practice today.
·                     Provide opportunities to dalits through scholarships, freeships, etc.
·                     Make it mandatory, through legislation, that a certain percentage of all contracts and tenders, whether government or private, is allotted to dalits.
 
·                     Work on changing the mindset of society at large towards dalits, so that dalits are treated as equals, with dignity and fairness and are not subjected to discrimination, segregation and untouchability.
 
The State has, by and large, only exercised the first two options; the last two have not been addressed at all. Hence the first two options create a tremendous amount of animosity and hatred in the minds of people at large who feel that the State pampers dalits and provides them opportunities that they (dalits) do not deserve. And so dalits face further repression, discrimination etc, and the vicious cycle continues...
 
Comparison with the situation of blacks in the US (and other places)
Many scholars have compared the situation of dalits in India with the situation of blacks in the US and other places. While there are a number of similarities in the plight of these two communities, one basic fact needs to be mentioned. Unlike the blacks, the dalit community in India is indistinguishable from society at large. There are no outward ways to identify a dalit. Dalits are as tall, short, dark, fair, stout, thin, intelligent or unintelligent as other sections of society. They are not a separate race or people. And anyway, anthropologists now debunk the concept of race as being unscientific and incomplete. Some tribal people have certain prominent physical features, but these are largely location- and geography-specific. With large-scale migration in search of livelihoods, dalit (and, to a lesser extent, tribal) communities are indistinguishable on the basis of physical characteristics.
 
To the best of my knowledge there is no research that proves that there are any genetic differences between the ""forward"" castes and dalits. Nor are there any studies showing that ""forward"" castes have higher IQs than dalits.
 
Towards a just society
What steps have the government, industry, the intelligentsia, educationists, elites and other opinion-makers in society taken for the development of dalits, and to create a just and inclusive society?
 
We know what steps the government is taking (they are constantly being criticised by opinion-makers at all platforms!). But besides the government none of the other stakeholders -- industry, the intelligentsia, educationists, elites and other opinion-makers -- have done anything that's worth mentioning. Rather, there is the constant buzz in the mainstream media about how merit is compromised by reservations, how reservations hinder the achievement of world-class quality, how India is falling behind because of such regressive State policy.
Although much of this comment is muted, implied and often not implicitly stated, of late it has become more strident. One example is industry's categorical and unequivocal ""No"" to the government's request/polite suggestion to initiate reservations in the private sector. The fact that affirmative action has been practised vigorously in the US for many years is conveniently ignored by industry mandarins who otherwise idolise all things Western (including the US). An important pillar of affirmative action in the US is industry's role and efforts in providing opportunities to blacks for self-development and empowerment, through preferential allotment of tenders and contracts.
 
There's the mistaken belief that reservation was for an initial period of 10 years only. But this applies to political reservations, ie reservations in governance, which is ratified and extended by Parliament every 10 years. There is no time limit set for reservations with regard to education, employment, promotions etc for dalits. Systematic efforts are made to confuse these two types of reservations; this needs to be addressed once and for all.
 
Achievements of dalits
The achievements of dalits in all spheres of public and private endeavour are remarkable, especially considering the limited opportunities available to them and also the hostile environment in which they have been made. Listed below are a few of them:
 
·                     Dalits have performed excellently in sports like hockey, archery, etc. Anybody who has the slightest doubt should race with the numerous ""Tirkeys"" who are a regular and permanent feature in Indian hockey! If dalits and tribals are systematically selected and groomed for endurance events and for the middle distance events in athletics, archery (communities like the Bhils are traditionally excellent archers), javelin-throwing, hockey, wrestling, marathons, swimming etc, they would make world champions.
 
·                     Many dalit communities have an innate sense and understanding of music and rhythm. If they are selected at a young age, groomed and trained for a career in these vocations at world-class institutions, they would become exceptional performers and artistes.
 
·                     Most of the roads, bridges, railway networks and tunnels in post-Independence India (even in earlier times) have been built by the sweat, blood and tears of the dalit people. The ""forward"" communities have been too soft and well-to-do to participate in such exhausting and non-remunerative, but nevertheless vital, nation-building activities. This does not stop them from driving/travelling or using them, while constantly criticising the drop in ""quality"" and ""merit"" due to the government's efforts to empower dalits by providing them opportunities through a sub-optimal policy option like reservations.
 
·                     The achievements of giants like Dr Ambedkar, Jagjivan Ram and Dr K R Narayanan and others are testimony to the inherent talent of dalits. It is important to note that Ambedkar received invaluable support in the form of patronage from two kings -- Sayajirao Gaekwad and Shahu Maharaj. It is only because of this that the otherwise poor Ambedkar was able to pursue higher education, develop his inherent talents, interact with world leaders, study at world-class institutions and attain self-empowerment. Shahu Maharaj even supported his newspapers and journals. Most dalits could never hope for access to such opportunities. Hence their latent talent withers away without achieving fruition. Society at large is ignorant of the lives, work and achievements of dalits because the mainstream media has never bothered to cover them, being obsessed with Page 3 events and personalities.
 
·                     There is an active section of dalits who occupy the highest positions in industry, education, government, and research institutions in India. There is also a vibrant dalit diaspora that is active all over the world. The diaspora thrives abroad without reservations, unhampered by prejudice and able to develop and bloom to the full extent that their talent, merit, hard work and education allows them to. Many members of the dalit intelligentsia, elite and leaders have reached positions where they do not need the support of reservations. Many can compete with the best, globally. The reason they do not advocate the abolition of reservations, though they themselves do not need it or use it, is in order not to deprive their brethren who still require support for their growth and development.
 
·                     Artisan dalits like potters, weavers, shoemakers etc are known all over India (even abroad) for their talent and fine skills in manufacturing artefacts of the highest quality and beauty.
 
Poverty of logic, reasoning and substance in the discourse on dalit empowerment
From the above it is obvious that the discourse and dialogue on the issue of development and empowerment of dalits and the popular criticism of reservations as undermining merit and quality in the meritocracy that is India (sarcasm intended!) is devoid of logic, reasoning and substance. The sooner opinion-makers realise this (and it stops being reported in the mainstream media, which in any case supports the status quo and acts as a handmaiden of dominant castes, communities and mindsets), the sooner India will develop. And be accepted by the comity of nations as a nation where human rights are not routinely violated for the section of society categorised as ""dalits"".

2400,"It is now less than a month before the country’s top long distance runners and others from across the globe converge on East London to take part in the annual Legends Marathon.This year’s edition on October 3 – the third in the marathon’s short history, promises to be a spectacle never seen before in the history of long-distance running in the Eastern Cape.

With an overall amount of R1-million up for grabs in prizemoney for participating athletes – the cherry on top is in the form of a car competition.

All athletes registered to run the race qualify for the car competition, as do all the fans attending the race.

The old saying: ‘Go big or go home’ could not have been more appropriate.

“It is important to reward the competitors in the race, but we also wanted to reward and thank those spectators who come out and support our events and runners on the day,” Legends Marathon founder and chairman Luthando Bara said.

For athletes, various lucrative cash prizes will be up for grabs. In the main event – the ultra marathon over 68km – the grand prize for the lucky runner, who reaches the finish line before everyone else, is a head-spinning R120 000. From big-name roadrunners known worldwide, to unknown rising stars still trying to crack it on the global stage, will be aiming for the first prize.

The prizes in the open division go all the way down to number 10 with the runner-up claiming, R80 000 while the third-placed runner will go home R60 000 richer. The fourth-placed runner will pocket R20 000, while R15 000 is up for grabs for the sixth athlete home. There is a R10 000 prize for seventh R8 000, eighth gets R6 000, ninth R4 000, while the 10th runner home receives R2 000 – all in the open division.

Three further age group divisions of 40-49 years, 50-59 years and 60+ will also receive cash prizes with the winner of each receiving R6 000, R5 500 and R4 500 respectively.

In the half marathon, the prize pool is considerably lower, with the male and female winner each taking home R15 000, while the runners-up receive R12 000 and third place R10 000.

Prizes go down to 10th in the open division, while age group prizes of juniors, 35-39 years, 4049 years and 50-59 years will be available for the first five runners in, with the winners claiming R4 500. Having received a major upgrade in the form of the International Association for International Marathon Standards (Aims) accreditation, Legends Marathon remains inclusive to all, unlike Comrades and Two Oceans, where only those affiliated to clubs can participate.

Bara said: “Running a marathon is a huge accomplishment but in addition to the gruelling race and their combined passion for running, we have a unique marathon that should be supported by all and sundry”.

The race is expected to also bolster the province’s tourism. — Additional reporting by Ross Roche.",50363919-667c-4c24-b726-fa91a8231845,News,2015-09-05T10:15:03Z,Daily Dispatch,Making top race stuff of Legends,0.0,News

2138,"Rev. Dr. Otis Moss, III, Senior Pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago, spoke during this year’s Congressional Black Caucus Annual Legislative Conference prayer breakfast, and NewsOne Now was there to capture his inspirational message. 
 
Moss connected the plight of the Black Lives Matter movement with the mission of a monumental Biblical figure. Rev. Moss expounded upon his point, saying John the Baptist was put in place to “design and create a ministry that will help the next generation.” 
 
“John comes in a period of history when the synagogue had been captured by Roman rule. Because previous to the period there was something known as the Maccabean Revolt. The Maccabean Revolt was the revolt that pushed back those Persians that sought to destroy the Hebrew community,” said Moss. 
  
Later during his remarks, Moss explained that High Priests at the time were in place to “preach about the personal, but not preach about the public,” which Rev. Moss considered to be “prophetic.” 
 
“As long as you are talking about how I’m doing personally, you can say whatever you want. But if you start talking about poverty, if you start talking about mass incarceration, if you start talking about food deserts, the powers that be will attempt to ‘take you out.’” 
  
According to Moss, John the Baptist connected with “a decentralized movement” because he recognized that “Hebrew lives matter.” Moss continued to explain that John moved out into the desert to “understand and communicate to people of this decentralized movement” because it was about “the next generation.” 
 
Moss considered this to be John’s “desert assignment.” He continued, saying John’s assignment was in a “place of little resources, a place that will never grow and develop” and implored those in attendance to “accept” their own desert assignments. 
 
Rev. Moss further explained his point: “Many of those who are collectively here (attending the Congressional Black Caucus Annual Legislative Conference), your constituency is not on the fruited plain, but in the desert. Your constituency is a constituency that has low resources, deals with mass incarceration, is dealing with a food desert, and if we are to be who God calls us to be, we must be willing to accept our desert assignment.” 
 
 “There is a desert inside our communities from food, education to mass incarceration and miseducation, and let us be clear here – this is the new Jim Crow,” said Moss. 
  
Moss then quoted Michelle Alexander, acclaimed civil rights lawyer and author of  The New Jim Crow,  saying, “It’s not because people have some type of cultural or moral or ethical deficit.” 
 
“We must understand that because of their proximity to poverty, there is limited access to and availability and because of their racial identity, they end up being incarcerated because of their proximity to opportunity and limited opportunity, and so we must accept our desert assignments,” said Moss. 
  
Rev. Moss added that things will not grow at the same rate they would if you were not in a desert, but ” you have to be comfortable where God calls you.”

(businesspress24) - VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA -- (Marketwired) -- 09/28/15 --   Western Potash Corp. (TSX: WPX)(FRANKFURT: AHE) (the ""Western"", ""the Company"") is pleased to announce that subsequent to the closing of the strategic investment from Beijing Tairui Innovation Capital Management Ltd. (""Tairui""), announced September 16th of this year, Mr. Chang Xiaogang (Geoffrey) has been elected to the position of Executive Chairman of the Board of Western Potash Corp. 

Mr. Chang is a graduate of Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management with a Master''s Degree in Business Administration. Previously he served as President and Chairman of Shanxi Top Energy Company Ltd., Deputy Chairman of Shanxi Securities Ltd., Deputy Chairman of Shanxi Zhangze Power Company Ltd., Chairman and President of Shanxi International Power Group Ltd. Mr. Chang also served as a full-time independent director of SASAC, China''s State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. 

Patricio Varas, CEO commented,"" The Western Potash board is pleased to welcome Geoffrey Chang as newly elected Chairman. Mr. Chang and Tairui bring a wealth of relevant experience that will help guide Western as the Company begins the transition to project construction."" 

Environmental Assessment Approval: 

Western is also pleased to announce that it has received Environmental Assessment Approval from the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment (""SMoE"") for the Milestone Project Pilot Plant, (""the Pilot Plant""). Western submitted an Environmental Impact Statement (""EIS"") for the Milestone Project initially in early 2013 as the project was considered a ""Development"" as defined in the province of Saskatchewan''s Environmental Assessment Act (""EAA""). As such it was subject to an Environmental Impact Assessment. Following a regulatory review, the EIS received Ministerial Approval from SMoE in April 2013. 

Subsequently, Western re-scoped the project as detailed in the Scoping Study for a Scalable Pilot Plant delivered earlier this year and announced in the July 2nd, 2015 news release. The Milestone Project Pilot Plant by contrast provides an alternative methodology that employs lower capital using innovative selective potash solution mining techniques. The change in mining methodology and design proposed for the Pilot Plant required review under the EAA as it represented a change from the original 2013 approval. A Project Description outlining the Pilot Plant was submitted to SMoE in July, 2015. Following review of the Project Description, Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment concluded that the proposed change will not result in significant environmental impacts different from those identified in the original EIS and is satisfied that the requirements of the EAA have been met. 
   
ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 

Patricio Varas, President and CEO

3045,"The Trenton community showed its resilience in August's hottest days, as locals gathered together at the Greenwood Ave. Farmers Market despite the heat. Every Monday neighbors from near and far congregate at the corner of Hudson and Greenwood Avenue to grocery shop for fresh produce and baked goods, utilize the free health services, or to enjoy Bingo outside with friends and new acquaintances. The music provided by various DJs welcomes people passing by on the street to come in and gives the market a comfortable feeling that encourages patrons to stay a while, try a free sample from the Rutgers Cooperative Extension healthy food demonstrations, and take a seat at one of the picnic tables to get a bit of shade from the sunny afternoon.

 

[caption id=""attachment_4576"" align=""alignright"" width=""225""] Healthy demonstration samples from Rutgers Cooperative Extension[/caption]
Every week we are inspired by the reoccurring friendly faces at the market. We are encouraged by the communities appreciative response to not only the available fresh fruits, vegetables, baked goods, meat, eggs, and flowers, but also the health services that are provided. The community has been served well by the free blood pressure screenings, glucose screenings, BMIs, vision & glaucoma screenings, nutritional consulting, pharmaceutical consulting, and other services that rotate weekly. We look forward to what the next couple of cooler months have in store for the market.

201,"The risk of renewed load-shedding is real this week, Eskom said on Monday.

It said planned maintenance of the Cahora Bassa hydroelectric station in Mozambique, an Eskom supplier, was being done until next Sunday.

“As a result, South Africa will get 650 MW instead of the 1500 MW from Cahora Bassa on a daily basis [during maintenance],” Eskom said.

“This maintenance is expected to be completed on Sunday 20 September, and the station is expected to be pumping at full capacity on Monday 21 September.”

The power system will be tight, particularly over the weekday evening peak periods from Tuesday 15 September to Friday 18 September.

Eskom urged consumers to continue using electricity sparingly to reduce the odds of load-shedding.

“As the weather begins to warm up, usage of electricity becomes high for most of the day, predominantly due to the increased usage of air-conditioners, geysers and pool pumps,” it said.

1248,"It was the Grand Final the All Stars basketball team should never have reached. Over the last three weeks the team had expected to be knocked out each time and what happened? They had come out onto the court and dominated their rivals. For the first time in the club's history a team had gone all the way and there were players and families from across the club out in numbers to support the team. 

The first quarter was inconclusive but the next two saw the team fall behind. Number ten from the opposition was unstoppable. Small in height he had enough body strength to muscle his way in and shoot and make the basket time after time. The opposition were a comfortable ten points ahead for much of the match but then, in the final quarter, the team started to score more freely and added eight points and the crowd started to lift. ""Lets' Go Defence Lets Go"" they screamed and there were loud cheers after the team repelled the offensive play of the opposition. The coach called a Time Out in the last ten seconds and the team attempted a play to tie the match but were unsuccessful. Despite driving into the key the ball was passed at the last minute but went off court. With three seconds left on the clock the opposition coach took a Time Out and when the ball was brought in it was in their offensive half. The whistle blew and it was all over. The crowd and team were still up and about, however, having made a contest of the match. The loss wasn't so tragic as a result and the boys held their held heads high.
""Phew I thought we were going to choke"" said number ten, the MVP for the match from the other team. The players embraced on the court and towards made their way to the area where the presentations were being made, They were asked to keep the speeches short but afterwards stayed to take photographs and were eventually asked to leave the area as the next two teams from another Grand Final arrived for their presentations. The evenness of the competition had been marveled at by both coaches. Both teams had had their ups and downs during the season and the fact that teams one to six had been knocked out of the finals and that teams seven and eight on the ladder had played each other in the Grand Final was seen as a great achievement by all.
At the celebration the following night there was lots of analysis of the game and the beer started to flow freely. The food trucks seemed few in number for the size of the crowd but the bar was well stocked and kept the crowd going with drinks. As it got dark there were more and more young people and less and less families. The players left their families to go and sit near the toilets to get away from all of the cigarette smoke. Back home the jungle drums started late into the night at the bar over the road.  An inspector from the council arrived to check their paperwork but the manager couldn't find any. At least he closed the window upstairs and muffled some of the noise. There was training next day for those players who were interested and try-outs scheduled for three weeks time.",48e15f37-4a81-4fbd-b6ef-0ac057e7b238,Blog,2015-09-19T22:46:54Z,LOSING THE PLOT,"RUNNERS UP, 2015",1.0,Blog
501,"Paul di Resta analyses both Sebastian Vettel and Lewis Hamilton's qualifying for the Singapore GP 

Sebastian Vettel has admitted his surprise at defeating Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton by over a second in qualifying for the Singapore GP to claim Ferrari's first dry pole in five years. 

The four-times world champion produced one of the laps of the year to register the Scuderia first pole position since 2012 and the team's first in dry conditions since F1 visited Singapore in 2010. It was also the German's first pole since Brazil 2013. 

Remarkably, not only did Vettel claim pole by half a second from Daniel Ricciardo with his Ferrari team-mate Kimi Raikkonen a further two tenths adrift, but he beat the fifth-placed Lewis Hamilton, chasing a record-equalling eighth consecutive pole in F1, by over 1.4 seconds. With Nico Rosberg a place behind Hamilton, it was, by a distance, Mercedes' worst result of F1's new turbo era. 

""It's a surprise. I thought they were sandbagging because there's no doubt they have the strongest package this year,"" said a startled Vettel. ""They must have some issues. 

""But I wouldn't rule them out for tomorrow. It's not the easiest circuit to overtake, but if you have the pace you can come through. So I expect them to be strong tomorrow."" 

It would certainly be foolish to write off Mercedes but Ferrari, closely followed by Red Bull, appear to have boasted a significant pace advantage all weekend with Vettel consistently a step ahead of Raikkonen and the chasing pack. 

But why? Ferrari introduced a brand-new upgraded engine two weeks ago at Monza, a change which immediately coincided with better single-lap pace from the Scuderia. However, the team are adamant that their new engines couldn't have been a factor in their unexpected superiority under the Marina Bay lights. 

""The effect of horsepower around here is about point one of a second so it's inconceivable you could make that sort of difference with horsepower,"" a bemused but delighted James Allision told Sky Sports F1. ""The gap to Red Bull is more or less what it should be around this sort of track but the strange thing is how slow the Mercs were."" 

Sebastian Vettel celebrates after landing his first pole for Ferrari in Singapore 

So was it a case of Ferrari making gains while Mercedes lost their way to create the perfect qualifying storm? While a frustrated Hamilton attributed his lack of speed to gripless tyres, Mercedes boss Toto Wolff admitted his team were at a loss to understand the scale of their defeat. 

""Shocked is probably not the right word but we are very surprised,"" said Wolff to Sky Sports F1. ""We have been surprised from the beginning onwards. We start with a certain simulation and what you expect from the track and somehow it hasn't worked. It could be many various factors. We've been very good for two years and not put a foot wrong but this time it was a step backwards."" 

Yet the last word must go to Vettel as the German celebrated his first pole position in Ferrari colours. ""It's a street circuit and the better you feel, the closer you get to the walls, the quicker you can go,"" he added. ""It's a circuit where the driver can make the difference."" 

And yes, the finger is back...

3160,"New York (AFP) - Third seed and 2012 champion Andy Murray came back from two sets down to defeat tiring Frenchman Adrian Mannarino and make the US Open third round on Thursday. 

Murray triumphed 5-7, 4-6, 6-1, 6-3, 6-1 after his world number 35 opponent had threatened to condemn him to his earliest loss in New York since also making the second round on debut in 2005. 

But left-hander Mannarino wilted in the 30-degree heat and humidity in Arthur Ashe Stadium as Murray's greater freshness and physical condition proved crucial. 

Murray goes on to face Brazilian 30th seed Thomaz Bellucci for a place in the last 16. 

""It was extremely tough. He hits the ball really flat, has fantastic timing on both sides and it was hard to read the ball in the first two sets,"" said 28-year-old Murray after his eighth career comeback from two sets to love down. 

""I was leaving the ball too short and he made me do a lot of running."" 

Murray, who had needed four sets to beat Nick Kyrgios in the opening round, fired 21 aces -- the last of which was on match point -- while Mannarino was undone by 61 unforced errors. 

It was a familiar tale of woe for the 27-year-old Frenchman, who also had a two sets to love lead over Feliciano Lopez at the Australian Open in January before retiring with heat exhaustion in the fourth set.

4064,"An AFP journalist looks at a page displayed on the website of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence May 20, 2015 in Washington (AFP Photo/) 

The lawyer for a Pakistani doctor who was jailed after helping the CIA find Osama bin Laden accused the government Thursday of deliberately delaying his appeal after the case was adjourned for the sixteenth time. 
 
Shakeel Afridi, who ran a fake hepatitis vaccination programme as cover for an operation to find the 9/11 mastermind, was in 2012 found guilty by a tribal court of having ties to militants and jailed for 33 years. 
 
The conviction was widely seen as politically motivated. 
 
Last year a tribunal cut 10 years off his sentence, but he filed an appeal in March seeking bail and a fresh trial. 
 
But Afridi’s lawyer, Qamar Nadeem Afridi, said that since March, 16 sessions had passed without any proceedings because the administration of Khyber tribal district had failed to submit documents for the case to the tribunal. 
 
“Yesterday (Wednesday) the judge again asked for the record and the Khyber administration did not submit it,” Qamar Afridi, adding that a new hearing had now been set for October 16. 
 
In his appeal Shakeel Afridi had asked the tribunal to review the entire case and acquit him or grant him bail until it was heard. 
 
“We are of the view that either Khyber administration is using delaying tactics so that Dr Afridi continues to languish in prison or they have lost the record,” his lawyer said. 
 
An official of the Khyber administration told AFP on condition of anonymity that for some “legal complications” they could not submit the case file, but now it would be done as soon as possible. 
 
The 2011 killing of Osama Bin Laden caused massive embarrassment for Pakistan and particularly its powerful military, which was accused of deliberately concealing him for possible use as a diplomatic bargaining chip with the US. 
 
Some US lawmakers have said Pakistan’s handling of the Afridi case was revenge for assistance in aiding a foreign power, and the US is withholding $33 million in planned aid pending Afridi’s release. 
 
The CIA’s fake vaccination campaign meanwhile increased Taliban opposition to immunisation drives, which the militants say are cover for spying, and attacks on health teams have claimed 78 lives since December 2",1d970cf0-798c-46fe-b12e-e55bc75b324b,News,2015-09-10T13:41:02Z,Raw Story,Pakistani doctor stuck in prison after helping US find Osama bin Laden,0.0,Blog
5890,"Howdy all, Gonna forgo my regular chapter this week for a couple reasons. First and foremost, I have been working on Riders & Kickers. Four proofs on this thing. I got The Green and Lynch's Boys in two goes. Riders & Kickers is half the size of those and for some reason, has taken more work to get done. I can't decide if I am more picky or if I am simply distracted. It's been a hell of a year, most of which has gone by in dreamlike and often painful blur. Anyways, I kicked the third proof copy back this week, so keep your fingers crossed. The other thing is that I am having to read over the chapters that will comprise the next, and final, book. Yes, we are coming up on the end of the trail. I've got to end this somewhere, and I want to make sure everything's tied up all nice and neat before I'm done. So like the other books before it, I have to re-read it to make sure it pans out right. We have a little ways to go...a couple more miles.  The idea of finishing makes me as sad as it does happy. I've been doing this so long, I'm a little scared to stop. Between re-reading Riders & Kickers until I want to puke, and sitting down and reading chapters 200+ as if I were just a reader, I can't write. Too much going on in my head. Fortunately, I'm almost done reading. I think I'll be back on track next week. But I don't want to rush it. Gotta do it right. I really do feel like I am  riding tired through the purple dusk with a warm, yellow light shining through the trees ahead of me. A few more fresh horses, and we'll be home.

1432,"As anyone with a birdfeeder can attest, spring and fall can bring interesting sightings, and with a hint of autumn now in the air, the show has started in my back yard.

The breeding season is now over, juveniles have long since fledged, male birds exhibit wanderlust and migrating species soon will be on the move.

My wife has positioned feeders and a birdbath along the side of our house, near low shrubs and a Bradford pear tree. We have cardinals year round, but on Sunday, we had them in particularly high concentration, with as many as 10 visible within a 200-square-foot area.

We've been fortunate in recent years to have a nesting pair of painted buntings nearby, which frequent our feeders. Lately, we've seen only the female and figured the male had departed for post-breeding dispersal. We had it half right, anyway.

The adult male has indeed been absent from the feeder, but we noticed that it wasn't two females that continued to feed. Rather, it was one female and two male juveniles that are just now distinguishable at casual glance. This weekend, we noticed for the first time that what we thought was a female was actually a pair of juveniles, which are now transitioning into adult plumage.

This weekend brought other interesting sights.

I decided to haul out my GoPro, which hadn't been turned on in a while, and position it near a hummingbird feeder. While capturing the video of a feeding ruby-throated hummingbird that is included with this post, I noticed how many other birds had gathered. At one time, I could turn my head 45 degrees and see in my yard cardinals, painted buntings, hummingbirds, tufted titmice, a white-breasted nuthatch, mourning doves, a Carolina wren and a Carolina chickadee. As the buntings flew away, a red-bellied woodpecker and a downy woodpecker flew in to feed on suet. About that time, I heard (but never saw) blue jays in a neighbor's water oaks.

Then a pine warbler -- a species we have not typically seen in our yard until at least October -- plopped down on a feeder.

Can goldfinches and yellow-rumped warblers be far behind?",08c9af8e-b648-4e8d-a1ba-5cda48caa68d,News,2015-09-14T12:24:00Z,Beaufort Gazette,Backyard birds: A time of transition around the feeders,0.0,News
4348,"Some weekend Central Asia reads: The manhunt for Tajikistan’s former deputy defense minister, Abduhalim Nazarzoda, is on. After the September 4 events that authorities report resulted in the deaths of nine police officers and 17 “terrorists,” the state formally charged Nazarzoda with “high treason, terrorism, sabotage, and creating an extremist group.” The authorities said on September 5 that the renegade general had fled to Romit Gorge, with seven to eight supporters. The numbers were arbitrary. The following days were filled with claims by the Tajik government to have arrested 17 members of Nazarzoda’s group “as a result of special operations” in Romit Gorge. As Asia-Plus reports, “According to official data, security forces have killed 22 members of Nazarzoda group and arrested more than 100 others, since the operation against the group was launched.” While the manhunt continues, read up on Nazarzoda to get a better picture of who the general is and what led up to the events of September 4. First check out Eurasianet’s profile of Nazarzoda. Then read Farangis Najibullah’s profile for RFE/RL, which goes deeper into explaining how Nazarzoda navigated the civil war and fit himself into the post-war peace arrangements. While Tajikistan’s September 9 Independence Day was marred by the ongoing manhunt, a different celebration in neighboring Uzbekistan also proceeded under significant gloom. The recently-fired director of the Nukus Art Museum which houses Igor Savitsky’s prized collection of banned Soviet art, Marinika Babanazarova, was absent from the museum’s centenary celebration of Savitsky’s birth. Agnieszka Pikulicka-Wilczewska wrote about the celebration for Eurasianet, noting that the the rainy day “felt like an omen.” In another art-related story in Uzbekistan, the European magazine Cafebabel interviewed Umida Akhmedova, an Uzbek photojournalist and documentary filmmaker who was convicted in 2010 of “defamation” and “insult” related to a documentary she had made with her husband about rural life in Uzbekistan. The government said they “had discredited and disrespected the traditions and values ​​of the Uzbek people.” While Akhmedova was quickly released, life remains difficult for her as an artist in the country. As Kyrgyzstan enters the month-long campaign season leading up to the October 4 parliamentary election, IWPR’s Timur Toktonaliev interviewed Tamerlan Ibraimov, director of the Center for Political and Legal Studies in Kyrgyzstan, about the development and evolution of rule of law in the country. While the Kyrgyz constitution enshrines the rule of law, Toktonaliev asks if that is really the case. In response, Ibraimov says right now the reality is that “ the law works in some cases, while elsewhere it is other things that prevail. Take what’s called ‘telephone law’ – when matters are resolved by a phone call from above. Or corruption, where what counts is who pays the most.” The interview dives into the erosion of the rule of law prior to Kyrgyzstan’s independence from the Soviet Union as well as the increasing role of religion in providing “answers to both spiritual and political questions.” Also a month away are Kazakhstan’s celebrations in Taraz of the 550th anniversary of the Kazakh Khanate. This weekend Astana is hosting a celebration of its own, part of an ongoing geopolitical and nationalistic statement. In August 2014, Putin responded to a question regarding Russian concern about nationalism in Ukraine and rising nationalism in Kazakhstan by saying that Nazarbayev had “created a state on a territory where there had never been a state. The Kazakhs had never had statehood. He founded it.” Nate Schenkkan translated the entire exchange and provided insightful commentary last year on Registan, writing that “this is an extraordinary event. I don’t know how the Kazakh government will respond to this, but assuredly there are people in Astana in very high places who are both scared and furious.”",a14e0c13-564e-485c-a273-6cbd742402c3,Blog,2015-09-11T16:13:18Z,The Diplomat,Current Events Overshadow Anniversaries in Central Asia,1.0,Blog
1278,"INDEPENDENT Liberal Party (ILP) leader Jack Warner is officially bowing out of active politics.

The party’s executive was expected to have met last night to discuss its future after its 31 candidates failed to garner substantial votes at Monday’s polls, Warner said yesterday after he left the Hall of Justice in Port-of-Spain, where he is appealing a judge’s order that he pay former Attorney General, Anand Ramlogan, SC, a little over $1 million in damages for defamatory statements he made at a local government campaign meeting in Chaguanas during 2013. 

And although the ILP will soon be looking to appoint a new leader, Warner said the struggle for democracy will continue. 

According to Warner, the ILP will now take up the mantle of becoming the moral compass in politics. “Many people thought the Congress of the People would have been the moral compass, but they abandoned this role, and the ILP will now fill that void,” he said. 

For his part, Warner, 77, said he will continue to guide and assist the party. “It is my last hurrah, but I will not leave politics,” he said. 

He also wants nothing to do with the party from which he resigned as a member and chairman in 2013. “I want to stay far away from the UNC as possible,” he said. 

According to Warner, the United National Congress (UNC), which suffered defeat at Monday’s general elections to the People’s National Movement (PNM), was still being run by a ‘cabal.’ Responding to views that UNC leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar should step down after leading the party to defeat in five consecutive elections (two by-elections, local government election, THA election and the general election), Warner said even if that happened, her possible successor of Oropouche East MP, Roodal Moonilal would be the last nail in the party’s coffin. 

Of the ILP’s poor showing, Warner said the party took a position not to spilt the votes to favour the People’s Partnership, pointing out that a private poll the party did in St Joseph and Tunapuna showed a division of the votes would have led to a UNC win in those constituencies.",63dd07b3-320c-478d-957f-5d98479f7bb9,News,2015-09-10T07:38:59Z,Trinidad and Tobago's Newsday,Jack bows out of active politics,0.0,Blog

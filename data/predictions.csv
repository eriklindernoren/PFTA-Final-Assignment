Exhausted and confused, migrants crammed onto a train to the Hungarian border town of Sopron, clinging to doors and squeezing their children through open carriage windows.

Trains to Vienna and beyond to Germany were cancelled, making it unclear what would be the next stop for the migrants - many of them refugees from wars in the Middle East.

Images of a drowned three-year-old face down in the surf on Turkish beach, one of at least 12 who died there the previous day while trying to sail for a Greek island, appeared in newspapers across the continent, increasing public pressure on politicians to take action.

The influx has strained the European Union’s asylum system to breaking point, sowing division among its 28 nations and feeding the rise of right-wing populists.

The major EU countries have taken sharply opposing positions on whether to offer welcome. Germany plans to accept 800,000 refugees this year, while Britain has set up a program to allow in Syrians that has accepted just 216.

Nearly all of the migrants arrive on the EU's southern and eastern edges but press on for richer countries further north and west, creating havoc for a bloc that normally allows free movement internally but restricts it for undocumented migrants.

“We want to go to Germany but that train in the station, maybe it goes nowhere. We heard it may go to a camp. So we will stay out here and wait,” said Ysra Mardini, a 17-year-old from the Syrian capital Damascus, dressed in jeans and a T-shirt.

Prime Minister Viktor Orban, in Brussels for talks with European leaders, said Hungarians and Europeans were “full of fear because they see that the European leaders ... are not able to control the situation.”

In an opinion piece for Germany’s Frankfurt Allgemeine Zeitung, he wrote that his country was being “overrun” with refugees, most of which, he noted, were Muslims, not Christians.

“That is an important question, because Europe and European culture have Christian roots. Or is it not already and in itself alarming that Europe’s Christian culture is barely in a position to uphold Europe’s own Christian values?” he asked.

Germany has begun accepting asylum claims from Syrian refugees regardless of where they entered the bloc, suspending rules which normally require them to register and remain in the first EU country they reach.

Berlin's generosity has caused confusion for its neighbors, which have alternated this week between letting migrants pass through and blocking them. Hungary allowed thousands to board trains for Germany on Monday but then called a halt to the travel, leaving migrants camped in the summer heat in central Budapest.

His 5-year-old brother Galip and mother Rehan, 35, also died after their boat capsized while trying to reach the Greek island of Kos. His father, Abdullah, was found semi-conscious and taken to hospital.

Abdullah’s sister Teema, a resident of Vancouver, said she heard the news from another of the boy's aunts: ""She had got a call from Abdullah, and all he said was, my wife and two boys are dead,"" Teema Kurdi was quoted as saying in Canada's National Post newspaper.

1228,"The Fat Jew, whose real name is Joel Otrovsky, revealed that his New York Fashion Week show will highlight 'real dads' The 30-year-old New York entertainer shot to notoriety in 2014 and gained more than 5 million followers on Instagram  Says the collection will include 'a lot of Rockports', 'sensible walking shoes', 'khakis' and 'pajamas with big giant plastic buttons'  
He calls himself 'the world's first plus-sized male model', and now the Fat Jew has revealed that he is bringing his brand of 'dad fashion' to the mainstream with his upcoming New York Fashion Week show. 

The Fat Jew, whose real name is Joel Otrovsky, revealed some secrets about his upcoming show at the Alexander Wang tenth anniversary New York Fashion Week event on Saturday - and told  Yahoo Style  that the catwalk will be 'like nothing the industry has ever seen' because it will be 'highlighting regular dads with very normal bodies'.  

In contrast to the star-studded guests surrounding him at the glamorous event, including Lady Gaga, Zoe Kravitz, The Weeknd, Bella Hadid, Tyga, and Kylie Jenner, the 30-year-old designer said that he cast The Dad Fashion Show rather randomly using 'a lot of Craigslist, and some real dads that I know'. 
   
Dad fashion: The Fat Jew, whose real name is Joel Otrovsky, said that he scouted unknown models on Craigslist for his New York Fashion Week collection  

He explained that the presentation, which will take place at the MADE Studios​ on September 16th, will also feature 'dad s**t' including 'a lot of Rockports', 'sensible walking shoes', 'khakis' and 'pajamas with big giant plastic buttons'. 

But The Fat Jew is not limiting his activities to high fashion: The funnyman also revealed that he is 'deejaying and hosting a sweet sixteen in New Jersey for a girl whose father either invented cruise control or the roof rack, I can’t remember which one'. 

'Yeah, I don’t know if I should be around that many 16 year olds, but this is happening. They hired me off Twitter. AND they put in the contract that I have to keep my shirt on,' he added.   
   
Fashion faux pas? Despite his unique sense of style and outspoken views about the industry, The Fat Jew has become one of NYFW's most unlikely front row stars 
   
Famous friends: The social media star has proved a hit with many Hollywood A-listers, including Justin Bieber (pictured) 

He confessed, however, that he was tempted to show off his 'Shrek body', since 'it takes a lot of work to look this s****y'.  

The New York-based entertainer, who shot to fame in 2014 after gaining five million Instagram followers in a matter of months, went on to say that sometimes it is all about the paycheck. 

'I wish it was a quinceanera, so if you’re having a quinceanera, please hire me,' he added. 'I will literally do whatever you want.' 

On that note, he said that in lieu of tiny canapes, his show will feature hoagies and Hotel California on repeat.   
   
Comedy: Ostrovsky's quirky - and occasionally controversial - breed of humor has made him a huge success on social media 

In the past, the self-described 'Z-list celebrity' has worked on the E! Channel as a correspondent interviewing celebrities, and was a member of genre-bending rap group Team Facelift.  

After the group's disbandment in 2010, Ostrovsky left music and began focusing solely on entertainment and plus-size modeling. 

He has created video campaigns for such brands as Virgin Mobile, Burger King,Bud Light, and Beats Electronics, and recently introduced a wine called White Girl Rosé. His rescued Cavalier King Charles spaniel, Toast, is also a social media star.  

His first book Money, Pizza, Respect will be released in November. He currently hosts a radio show on Apple Music Beats 1 called 'Money, Pizza, Respect'.  ",887403df-2c36-4e6e-bcca-b6c3bb6fd652,News,2015-09-15T19:15:46Z,Mail Online UK,Instagram's The Fat Jew reveals he used Craigslist to find 'real' models,0.0,News

Big Brother gave the housemates some drinks for the night and Chloe-Jasmine rushed into the storage room to take some alcohol for Stevi and Bobby. 
 
This angered Austin saying:  “it’s just ironic that the other day you couldn’t get out of bed because you couldn’t be around alcohol and now you are running to the fridge to grab booze for him.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Buying shares of Volkswagen AG before the potential toll of the German carmaker's diesel emissions scandal becomes clear is a dangerous move for investors, according to a report on Sunday in Barron's financial newspaper. 
 
According to Barron's, Volkswagen's shares trade for 5.1 times estimated 2016 earnings, and 0.6 times book value, though analysts' earnings forecasts are failing to account for potential charges. 
 
The world's biggest carmaker by sales has admitted to U.S. regulators that it programmed its cars to detect when they were being tested and alter the running of their diesel engines to conceal their true emissions. 
 
The company could be fined about $18 billion in the United States alone, and it could face billions of dollars in fines in Germany and other countries that find that tests have been rigged, the report said. The potential costs of the diesel problem present a massive challenge to Volkswagen's new chief executive, Matthias Muller, the head of Porsche who is replacing Martin Winterkorn, who resigned on Wednesday.

5702,"With  Shantanu Narayen(Adobe), Satya Nadella(Microsoft), Sundar Pichai(Google) and Narendra Modi, the stage at Digital India dinner in Silicon Valley was a perfect picture of India-U.S. partnership in the digital economy.  Addressing the gathering, Modi shared his vision of the connected India and the role of technology and innovation in shaping the future of the largest democracy of the world. 
 

 On Silicon Valley and the tech giants   California is one of the last places in the world to see the sun set. But, it is here that new ideas see the first light of the day.  Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are the new neighborhoods of our new world.  If Facebook were a country, it would be the third most populous one and the most connected. Google today has made teachers less awe-inspiring and grandparents more idle. Twitter has turned everyone into a reporter. The traffic lights that need to work the best are on CISCO routers.   On changing times and role of technology   The most fundamental debate for India’s youth is the choice between Android, iOS or Windows.  From computing to communication, entertainment to education, from printing documents to printing products, and, now to internet of things, it’s been a long journey in a short time. From cleaner energy to better healthcare and safer transport, everything is converging around the work you do.  In India, a mother in a distant hill village has a better chance to save her new born infant. A child in a remote village has better access to education. A small farmer is more confident about his land holding and getting better market price. A fisherman on the sea has a better catch. And, a young professional in San Francisco can Skype daily to comfort her sick grandmother in India. An initiative by a father in Haryana for “Selfie with daughter” to draw attention to the girl child became an international movement.    How Modi’s government has leveraged on technology  
Modi claims that 180 million new bank accounts have been created in a few months; direct transfer of benefits to the poor; funds for the unbanked; insurance within the reach of the poorest; and, pension for the sunset years for all; all of this could be possible because of technology savvy measures by the government. 
 
Modi believes that in this digital age, we have an opportunity to transform lives of people in ways that was hard to imagine just a couple of decades ago. He sees technology as a means to empower and as a tool that bridges the distance between hope and opportunity. He says, 
 
“Social media is reducing social barriers. It connects people on the strength of human values, not identities.” 
 
According to Modi, technology is forcing governments to deal with massive volume of data and generate responses, in very little time now. In a country with 800 million youth under the age of 35 years, impatient for change and eager to achieve it, his government aims to transform governance, making it more transparent, accountable, accessible and participative. 
  M-Governance: Modi believes that mobile governance is the way to go in a country with one billion cell phones and use of smart phones growing at high double digit rates. It has the potential to make development an inclusive and comprehensive mass movement. After MyGov.in , he launched the Narendra Modi Mobile App to stay in close touch with people.    Paperless transactions : The government plans to set up a digital locker for every citizen to store personal documents that can be shared across departments. They have set up Ebiz portal to make approvals for businesses and citizens easy and efficient. Modi says,   
“ But for all this, we must bridge the digital divide and promote digital literacy in the same way that we seek to ensure general literacy. We must ensure that technology is accessible, affordable, and adds value.” 
  Digitally connected India : Modi is keen to get 1.25 billion citizens to be digitally connected. India’s broadband usage went up by 63% last year. Launch of the National Optical Fibre Network will take broadband to 600,000 villages. Government is teaming up with Google, to make 500 railway stations wi-fi enabled. Common Service Centres will do the same in villages and towns.    Local languages: According to Modi, access means that content should be in local languages.Government is equally sensitive about data privacy and security, intellectual property rights and cyber security.    Indo-US partnership  
Modi believes that Indians and Americans have worked together to shape the knowledge economy. He says, 
 
“We all know that the dynamic Asia Pacific Region will shape the course of this century. And, India and the United States, the world’s two largest democracies, are located at the two ends of this region. We have the responsibility to shape a future of peace, stability and prosperity in this region.” 
 
Modi believes that the relationship of India and US is also defined by the power of youth, technology and innovation and we can draw on the strength of our values and partnership to shape a better and more sustainable future for the world. 
 
Amen to that!

318,"(BPT) - When it comes to your computer it’s a PC or Apple. And, if you have a PC, your machine runs on a Microsoft operating system. 

Sound familiar? 

If it does, you’re in luck because the new Windows 10 is finally here and there are plenty of reasons to love this new operating system. “Microsoft combined the best features of Windows 7 and Windows 8,” says tech guru, Mario Armstrong. Windows 10 has been designed to offer you optimal performance on every device it runs so you can enjoy a Windows 7-like experience when using your computer or a Windows 8 experience on your mobile device. 

Windows 10 also offers a free personal assistant, built-in apps, increased photo and map capabilities and all the tools you need to manage your obligations with improved mail and calendar options, along with more opportunities to have some fun with movies, shows and music. 

So how do you transition to Windows 10? It’s easier than you think and to help you through the process, Armstrong offers these tips: 

* Back it up. Whether you decide to upgrade your current computer to Windows 10 or to buy a new Windows 10 powered device, it’s always a good idea to take some time and make sure all of your important files have been backed up. Get an external hard drive and use Microsoft’s free Backup and Restore software to copy all of your files over. This way, if something goes wrong, you’ll know everything is safe and sound. 

* Trust it to the professionals. Upgrading can be a scary process, since it’s possible to lose files or forget to uninstall certain drivers. Create your own safety net by taking advantage of the Staples EasyTech program and a knowledgeable Staples associate will upgrade your computer to Windows 10 for free. Just call or head into a local store to make an appointment and you’ll be running Windows 10 in no time. Any device running Windows 7 or later is eligible. 

* Find the right device for your new operating system. Before you enact a Windows 10 upgrade, you need to figure out if you’ll be upgrading your current computer or transitioning to a new device. The good news is if your current laptop, tablet or hybrid device runs Windows 7 or Windows 8 already, it can probably handle Windows 10’s system requirements, but you should double check to make sure. If your computer barely meets the minimum requirements but runs fine, you should hold off on upgrading until you can afford a new device. Even though Windows 10 is free for most people, adding it to an older device may slow the device down. You can learn more about upgrading for free from Microsoft’s site. 

For PC users, Windows 10 offers them the chance to use and enjoy their devices like never before and upgrading is easy. Simply follow Armstrong’s tips before you upgrade and visit your local Staples store for help. Then, your old companion will have a new and exciting look and feel in no time.",6f327d6b-d0d0-421e-9c0a-da4c681bd5ee,News,2015-09-10T01:05:02Z,Tate County Democrat,3 easy steps to upgrade your computer to the latest operating system,0.0,News

370,"David Cameron should push for ""effective action"" against Islamic State and the creation of civilian safe zones in Syria under a United Nations resolution that would leave the door open to military intervention, Hilary Benn has said. 
 
		 
The shadow foreign secretary did not set out how the safe zones would be policed but insisted he did not want to see British ""boots on the ground"". 
  Hilary Benn said David Cameron should push for ""effective action"" against Islamic State   
He called on the Prime Minister to ""strain every sinew"" at a UN summit in New York to seek an agreement from world leaders that would also refer suspected war criminals to the International Criminal Court and create a post-war plan for Syria together with Gulf and neighbouring states. 

			 
Mr Benn failed to set out whether Labour would back air strikes against IS, also known as Isil or Daesh, in Syria with Mr Cameron expected to call a Commons vote on intervention next month - action to which leader Jeremy Corbyn remains opposed. 



 
And the shadow foreign secretary put himself at odds with Mr Corbyn by praising former prime minister Tony Blair's decision to join Nato military action in Kosovo in 1999 - an intervention which the Labour leader has criticised in the past. 

Mr Benn told the party conference in Brighton: ""Given the scale of the crisis in Syria he (Mr Cameron) should be staying on in New York and straining every sinew to secure a comprehensive United Nations Security Council resolution under chapter seven of the UN charter calling for effective action to end threat from Isil/Daesh, the creation of safe zones in Syria to shelter those who have had to flee their homes, the referral of suspected war crimes to the International Criminal Court that a Labour government played such a big part in establishing. 

""Increased humanitarian aid to those who have fled to neighbouring states, an international agreement for countries to welcome their share of Syrian refugees and a major international effort bringing together Russia, Iran, the neighbouring countries, the Gulf states, the United States of America and Europe to agree a post-civil war plan for Syria. 

""It is no longer good enough for the world to say this is too difficult, it is now time for the world to say this has got to stop."" 

			 
Mr Benn highlighted Labour's internationalist history and praised former PM Mr Blair's decisions to intervene in Kosovo and Sierra Leone in the Nineties. 

He said: ""In our party, in our movement, we understand that our responsibilities extend beyond Britain's shores. 

""From the struggle against Franco's fascism in the 1930s to the defeat of Nazi Germany. 

""From the fight against apartheid in South Africa to the protection of the people of Kosovo and Sierra Leone, we have always been proud internationalists, proud to stand in solidarity with those in trouble and determined not to walk by on the other side of the road.""

6621,"The major theme that comes up time and again when speaking to people in Japan’s IP industry is that the country’s largest operating companies are under increasing pressure  to monetise their IP assets. After decades of high-volume patenting at no small cost, today’s tougher economic environment has forced many Japanese rights holders to consider partaking in activities – such as selling patents and partnering with NPEs  in order to license their portfolios – that are traditionally frowned on. Even today, a significant cross-section of the country's corporate IP leaders see such activities as ‘trolling’ or, at the very least, as encouraging ‘troll’-like behaviour. That remains a key debate and one that will be a topic at the forthcoming IPBC Asia in Tokyo this November. 
 
Seldom, though, these days do we think about the other side of the equation; that is, of Japanese corporates being big-time acquirers of third-party patent portfolios. Of course, there is always going to be the odd deal here and there, but in a world where portfolio trimmimg is the name of the game, purchasing assets is not high on most corporate to-do lists. There is, though, one exception. In a time of retrenchment, one big Japanese company seems ot be bucking the trend by being very lively on the buy side over the past few years. 
 
In fact, Tokyo-based internet and e-commerce player Rakuten was the 13 th most active buyer of US patents globally between 2010 and 2014, according to research from Allied Security Trust that was published in issue 69 of IAM late last year. Over that time, it participated in 27 transactions, acquiring a total of 659 US patent assets. This put it just ahead of Microsoft, which conducted 23 transactions to acquire 538 patents during the same period. 
 
Rakuten – whose name means ‘optimism’ in Japanese – was founded in 1997, but its major expansion internationally began in earnest in the late 2000s. In addition to purchasing patent portfolios in order to strengthen its market position and operational freedom, Rakuten has also been highly active in M&A deals and venture investments, which have further contributed to its overall IP holdings. It has also been busy in terms of organic IP growth with its own intensive R&D and patent filing efforts. 
 
Using data from the ktMINE  database, I have put together the below table to give an overview of Rakuten’s main sources of intellectual property as it has gone about its patent buying spree since 2010. The table lists patent assignments from third-party organisations that involve more than one asset being transacted, so it does not necessarily take into account patents that have been obtained through M&A activity. The leading vendor of patents to Rakuten is compatriot JVC Kenwood; while a number of other Japanese electronics companies also feature prominently.

4211,"New Zealand equestrian Tim Price and horse Ringwood Sky Boy have finished second in the presitigious Burghley Horse Trials in England after a fluent and foot perfect showjumping round. 

""What can I say,"" a jubilant Price said immediately after the ride on Sunday. 

""He's exceeded all expectations. It's his third or fourth attempt at four star [level] and to put all three phases together and come close to winning is amazing."" 

Ringwood Sky Boy never looked like taking a rail, jumping confidently and beautifully all the way around the course, finishing to huge cheers of joys from the Kiwi supporters. 

German world No 1 Michael Jung on La Biosthetique Sam put on a masterly display to maintain their lead after cross country and earn him a deserving Burghley title. 

Earlier, Jung opted not to lead Sam in the trot up as the reigning Olympic and European champion rider was still visibly sore from a fall off his second horse Fischerrocana FST during the cross-country phase. 

As well as claiming £46,000 (NZ$111,000) as runner-up, Price picked up a US$5000 (NZ$8000) bonus through a sponsor promotion. 

Sadly for Price's wife, Jonelle, Classic Moet hit the first combination of the treble, dropping them from third place overnight to fifth. 

""It's one of those things – it could have stayed up or down,"" she said. 

""I'm delighted with her performance. Finishing third would have been the ultimate but I said early in the week that to have two in the top five would be great and that's what we've got. 

""It equals my previous best here,"" she said referring to her fifth on The Deputy last year. 

Fellow New Zealander Sir Mark Todd on horse Leonidas produced a beautiful clear round to rise one place to sixth and earlier in the day the horse won the prize for best conditioned horse; a fitting nod to the horse's magnificent order. 

""I was thrilled with him,"" said Todd. 

""He's a very good jumper and just keeps getting better and better. He couldn't have done any more out there."" 

Kiwi Jock Paget and Shady Grey had one fence down to finish in 16th place delighting his rider. 

""I'm really happy with him,"" Paget said. 

""He was very calm out there and was very good."" 

Australian rider Chris Burton finished in third and fourth place – Classic Moet's dropped rail allowing him to sneak up the order. 

The best British rider was Kristina Cook in eighth place.

6502,"http://bit.ly/1xL7R8f – Misty Stone reminisces on her younger days of prostitution and money-grinding in this exclusive VladTV interview. Before diving into the film industry, Stone says she started as a dancer at the age of 17-years-old. She was taught to carry a fake ID in the event that she would be caught, but to her delight, she stayed out of trouble. After meeting a man by the name of “Famous” the following year, Stone decided to switch up her profession by getting into prostitution. Stone says the 38-year-old housed a sizable amount of women, including Stone who would make $1500 a night. In those days, Stone says she had to meet with 10-15 men to make her desired quota. While the stigma of an abusive relationship are often heard in the field, Stone says she only had one moment with Famous that involved her “teeth tearing through her lip.” She explained how she was feisty with Famous until he put his hands on her. After being the game for about a year, Stone moved from California to Nebraska to change her lifestyle. She went back to school to get her diploma and even got a job as a telemarketer. She later decided to move back to L.A to pursue her career in the industry.

The modern game has a shortage of world class strikers. That was the sentiment of Arsene Wenger this year at least, and many other managers look to be in agreement as Europe’s elite spend extortionate amounts of money on the few players available. 
 
The result of this shortage is managers looking to theirs and others’ youth squads. Plucking out the hottest attacking talent and moulding them into the next superstar. Henry, Ronaldo and Messi cost less than £25million combined and almost single-handedly revolutionised their respective teams. And so we come to one of the greatest FIFA challenges for any burgeoning career manager to take on: developing a wonderkid into a superstar. 
 
Only those in it for the long haul need apply. It will take multiple seasons of meticulous training, using the new FIFA 16 training system and lots of game time with the first team. And that has to come after you have scouted the world to find that special youngster. 
 
To make things a little easier for those taking on the challenge, here are some of the top talents to have emerged in recent years who could fit into any top tier side as well as those fighting it out in the lower leagues. And some of them may be closer to home than you think. 
 
  
 14. Chuba Akpom – Arsenal  Nick Potts/EMPICS Sport  
Pace, finishing and technique. The trio of traits that underpin the likes of Messi, Ronaldo and Aguero can all be found in young Chuba Akpom. While he still needs plenty of refining and some experience before he is ready to compete in the top flight, Akpom is a talent well worth developing. 
 
Assuming that the FIFA game play doesn’t alter too much for 2016, pace will be a dominant force in the game and Akpom has bags of it. Along with some impressive dribbling and balance skills to take advantage of those good positions that he can get into. 
 
FIFA 15 started Akpom with a 58 rating and a potential of 75 but after another season of scoring for fun in the U-21’s, a great pre season and start to his loan spell in the Championship, it is highly likely that the young striker will see a points bump in both starting and potential for FIFA 16.",a6b4ca0e-34bd-46c0-b908-151441b1e54b,Blog,2015-09-07T15:41:04Z,WhatCulture.com » WhatCulture.com,FIFA 16: 14 Striker Wonderkids You Should Think About Signing,1.0,Blog
228,"Search the term ""cut crease"" on YouTube and you'll find hundreds of tutorials on the eye makeup look. Just as the name describes, it's a technique used to define the crease by ""cutting"" across it with a contrasting eyeshadow color and little to no blending. 
 
""If done right, a cut crease will change your makeup game if you have a medium to heavy fold. It lifts your eyes and makes them appear more open,"" says makeup artist and YouTuber Sona Gasparian . ""You instantly lift your eyelids with this technique. And what's great about it is that you can go super soft or really dramatic depending on your mood."" 
 
If you're new to the technique, she says a good tip is to keep the intensity on the outer corner of the eyes. 
 
""Start slow and build the intensity to achieve the most natural look,"" she says. ""The best way is to keep your eyes open when placing your cut crease. Look straight in the mirror and place a line where you want your new fold to appear, and start to build the shadow over the line blending upward."" 
 
Gasparian says she likes to keep her makeup looks natural, so she blends her cut crease a little more than usual and demonstrates it in her Taylor Swift Bad Blood Makeup Tutorial below:

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has documented his push to bring U.S. investments and jobs back to India on his Facebook and Twitter pages since landing in the United States this week, posting photos with the likes of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and group shots with Fortune 500 CEOs. 
 
This weekend, his followers can expect a flurry of photos with tech leaders as he visits Silicon Valley and is due to meet with executives from Google Inc, Facebook Inc, Apple Inc and Tesla Motors. 
 
Much of his agenda, aimed at deepening ties with the U.S. tech sector, will also focus on connecting with Silicon Valley's Indian diaspora. 
 
While Modi is likely to be received like a rock star in an area that is home to many of the world's biggest high-tech firms, some groups have protested his arrival and urged tech companies to boycott the visit. 
 
The groups include Sikhs for Justice, which has called on its members to picket Facebook headquarters during a Facebook town hall, and the Alliance for Justice and Accountability. 
 
Modi has been criticized for not doing enough to stop 2002 religious riots in the Indian state Gujarat that killed about 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, when he was chief minister of the state. He has vehemently denied any wrongdoing. 
 
Modi is the first Indian leader to visit the U.S. West Coast in more than 30 years. His trip follows one by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who met with several tech leaders in Seattle earlier this week. 
 
The Indian leader has said he sees the digital economy as crucial to bringing more growth and tech jobs to India. 
 
Modi boasts an average 87 percent approval rating in India and he has more than 30 million ""likes"" on Facebook and 15 million Twitter followers, making him the second-most followed world leader after U.S. President Barack Obama. 
 
On Saturday, he was scheduled to attend a dinner with 350 business leaders to discuss the world economy and its impact on India. 
 
Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai and Shantanu Narayen, the Indian-born CEOs of Microsoft Corp, Google and Adobe Systems Inc, respectively, were among those due to moderate a panel discussion before Modi delivers a speech at the dinner. 
 
Modi is also expected to meet with Apple CEO Tim Cook and visit Tesla headquarters. On Sunday, he was to visit Facebook and Google headquarters before appearing at an event at the San Jose Convention Center.

2498,"Geechi Mouf is an American rapper and songwriter, and also the founder and CEO of Hav-Not Muzic Group Record Label. He is most known for the rising popularity of his hit single “Cold Turkey” which covers the controversial topic of dealing drugs. 
 
Synopsis: 
Geechi Mouf was born Beau Knox, in 1978 Volusia County, Florida, on October 26, 1978. Raised in Deland, Florida, Geechi was influenced by street-oriented rappers like 8Ball & MJG, Trick Daddy, Tupac, Master P. 
During his incarceration in 1998, he began to write rap lyrics of his own 
that geared toward the street life and drug dealing & money. Known then as Lil Loc formed Tha Hav-Notz and joined a rap group from his 
neighborhood which combined local rap groups and solo acts forming C.O.D (City of DeLand). 
In 2000, Geechi Mouf (then Lil Loc) and Tha Hav-Notz signed to Full Moon Records, an independent record label owned by Brain “DJ FURY”Graham, a Southern bass legend”. However,the label folded 
the following year and The Hav-Notz were released from their contract. 
In 2003, Geechi Mouf and the group began working with Tra Thomas, a former NFL athlete, who funded their early rap careers and moved 
them to New York. 
 
After yielding little success, Geechi Mouf and Tha Hav-Notz decided to head back to Florida. Shortly after their move back to Florida, Geechi Mouf learned how to engineer his own music and began the DIY-method of building and structuring Hav-Not Muzic Group. 
In 2014, Geechi Mouf released his first mix tape under the HNMG recording label, entitled A Mouf Full which featured his first single “MJ KILLA”. 
His follow up debut “Cold Turkey” which tackled his controversial lifestyle as a drug dealer, was released in early 2015, and has since gained popularity across the southern regions of the United States.

 Fundamental Forecast for CAD: Bearish  

 Canada’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) expanded an annualized 1.3% in August, a marked slowdown in the core rate of inflation may dampen the appeal of the Loonie.    Oil Gains and a dovish rhetoric from the Federal Reserve have allowed the Canadian dollar to gain nearly one and a half percent against the USD.    For up-to-date and real-time analysis on the CAD, Oil and market reactions to economic factors currently ‘in the air,’ DailyFX on Demand can help.   


 Canada’s August consumer price index came in right as expected across the board for the year-over-year reading with no revisions providing signs of stability in the energy reliant economy. The firm economic data help support the Canadian dollar alongside other commodity currencies after the Federal Reserve on September 17 decided not to raise rates and mentioned they were monitoring developments abroad in regards to their monetary policy, which could keep the US dollar weaker benefiting the Canadian dollar in a multitude of ways.  


 Inflation will continue to be an important focal point as many feared the numbers could be more subdued due to disinflation or he forces of the recent decline in oil prices have increased economic slack however the lower Canadian dollar trend appears to be helping the headline number. Should oil stabilize helping to reduce the slack, a handful of investment banks are expecting a return of CPI to the central bank’s 2% target within 18 months.  


 The direction of oil prices will continue to be important for the Canadian economy. The 20% move higher since late August is helpful but many have learned not to trust these moves higher for long given the deteriorating economic outlook of many economies like China, Europe and other struggling developing markets.  


 While not overly affecting the Canadian dollar in the short term, Thursday also saw three candidates for can does Prime Minister Position discuss the economy. The candidates, incumbent Stephen Harper, Liberal leader Justin Trudeau and New Democratic Party lead Tom Mulcair took the stage but no one ended the night as a clear winner. However, Harper remaining as Prime Minister appears to be a most Friendly outcome for the October 19 elections.

6655,"SYRACUSE, N.Y. -- Charges filed against 21 people during a Syracuse police gang crackdown this summer range from noise violations to assault. The defendants were charged between July 4 and Aug. 12 during Truce, a program aimed at curbing violence following homicides linked to gangs. Police announced the arrests at a news conference Aug. 18, but did not release the names of the people investigators suspected of being Uptown and LAMA gang members. The names were released after syracuse.com filed a Freedom of Information Law request. The death of Azhawn Harvey, a suspected Bricktown gang associate, convinced police to launch the crackdown, Police Chief Frank Fowler has said. Harvey was shot in the head by Shaquez Collins during a Fourth of July shooting at Thornden Park, Fowler said. Fowler said he learned Collins, a suspected Uptown member and LAMA associate, shot Harvey in retaliation for another shooting. The chief said he then increased patrols in both gangs' territories. By the end of the crackdown, 64 charges were filed against the 21 people. Those charged: Shaquez Collins, 16, was charged with assault and criminal possession of a firearm. Manuel Ocasio, 17, was charged with carrying a weapon, criminal trespass, burglary and petit larceny. Victor Collins, 29, was charged with violating parole for a drug possession conviction.

2959,"U.S. Vice President Joe Biden delivers remarks at the U.S.-Ukraine Business Forum in Washington July 13, 2015.  Reuters/Yuri Gripas    
U.S. Democratic voters would choose Vice President Joe Biden as their preferred candidate for president in 2016 if current frontrunner Hillary Clinton shows signs of faltering, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday. 

More than 38 percent of Democrats polled said they would vote for Biden in the Democratic Party nominating contest, if polling indicated that Clinton would lose to a Republican candidate. 

Thirty percent of Democratic voters said they would back liberal Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders should Clinton, a former secretary of state, run into trouble, according to the tracking poll conducted from Aug. 28 through Sept. 1. 

Fewer than a quarter of voters said they would stick by Clinton. The survey suggested that while Clinton's support is broad, voters are far from committed, which could indicate risks for her if Biden were to jump into the race. 

Biden has been consulting with advisers over whether he should launch a 2016 presidential bid. With the first Democratic presidential primary debate planned for Oct. 13, Biden is under pressure to make a decision within the next few weeks. 
 
A total of 499 people who identified themselves as Democrats took part in the poll, which had a credibility interval of plus or minus 5.1 percentage points. 

Clinton remains the top choice for Democratic voters, with more than 44 percent favoring the former first lady, according to Tuesday's Reuters/Ipsos polling data. Sanders had the support of a quarter of those surveyed, and Biden almost 17 percent. 
 
But Clinton's lead narrowed in recent days as her polling numbers fell below 50 percent in August and as Sanders, a self-described socialist, drew a bit closer. 

Sanders' campaign has focused on wealth inequality and the economic struggles of the middle class. He has drawn large crowds and has appeared to gain traction especially among students, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. 

Voters in various polls have said they lack trust in Clinton as she struggles with a controversy over her use of a private email server for official business during her tenure as the top U.S. diplomat. 
 
The FBI is investigating the security of the private server and any classified information on it. Clinton says she did nothing wrong and only used the private account out of convenience. 

An August interview survey of 22 voters who had participated in Reuters/Ipsos polling and supported Biden found many of them describing the vice president as ""honest,"" ""genuine"" and ""trustworthy.""

3676,"Simple Verse was disqualified from first place in the Ladbrokes St Leger at Doncaster after a stewards' inquiry into interference with runner-up Bondi Beach. 
 
The Ralph Beckett-trained Simple Verse looked like she had justified the decision to supplement her for the final Classic of the season, but her rider  Andrea Atzeni, successful 12 months ago on Kingston Hill, had to manoeuvre his mount off the rail in the closing stages. 
 
Simple Verse (8-1) and the Colm O'Donoghue-ridden Bondi Beach (2-1 joint-favourite) had a bit of a bumping match before the former passed the post a head to the good. 
 
An inquiry was swiftly called into possible interference, and after both riders had argued their case, the announcement was made that the placings would be reversed, meaning another Classic for Aidan O'Brien. 
 
Paul Smith, owner of Kingston Hill and representing the Coolmore operation which includes his father, Derrick, said: ""I didn't have an opinion if he would get the race. 
 
""When Colm got off the horse he said he'd got a couple of bumps and we had an awfully good case to argue in the stewards' room."" 
 
O'Brien was at Leopardstown, where he told At The Races: ""I'm delighted, you're always sorry to get a race like that, but I think it was a little bit messy up the straight and Colm gave him a great ride. He's a brave horse. 
 
""He was a little bit unlucky the last time in York this horse (narrowly beaten following interference in the Great Voltigeur) and there was no doubt he was running back at the line. 
 
""I'm sorry for connections of the second, but we're delighted that he won. 
 
""It's only his fifth run, he loves fast ground and he stays well. He'll be a lovely horse next year.""

Beckett, whose Secret Gesture was recently demoted to third after being first home in the Beverly D, Stakes at Arlington in the same colours, said: ""I'm astonished, apart from anything else. There's no consistency in the rules.

86,"Dollars. image source eni The dollar was broadly weaker in cautious Tokyo trade Wednesday, ahead of a US interest rate decision this week that could see the first hike in almost a decade. 
 
The greenback fell to 120.30 yen from 120.40 yen Tuesday in New York, and the euro rose to $1.1278 from $1.1272, while several battered emerging market currencies also gained. 
 
The single currency fell to 135.67 yen from 135.71 yen. 
 
Economists are split over whether the US central bank, at the end of a two-day meeting Thursday, will raise rates for the first time since 2006. 
 
Financial markets are pricing the likelihood of a hike at around 32 percent, Bloomberg News said, a sharp drop from before Beijing devalued the yuan in August when the majority of dealers expected a September move. 
 
While the Fed has signalled it will raise rates this year, the odds on a rise this month have dropped as concerns have mounted about slowing growth in China and its impact on the world economy. 
 
Takuji Okubo, chief economist of Japan Macro Advisors, told AFP that if the market reaction to a rate hike is limited that would suggest the global economy is in better shape than expected. 
 
“It’s not that a Fed hike itself is actually positive, but it (would mean) that the global economy isn’t as vulnerable as people feared,” Okubo said. 
 
“That could actually reduce uncertainty in the global economy. And the BoJ may like it because the yen may decline without their intervention (such as further stimulus),” he added. 
 
Asia-Pacific currencies, including the Singapore dollar and the Malaysian ringgit, which have been battered by concerns over China and the strengthening of the dollar in recent months, also rose on Wednesday. 
 
Higher rates would tend to strengthen the greenback, and could severely hurt emerging markets as investors draw their cash out and turn to the US looking for better, safer returns. 
 
The South Korea won rallied a day after the Standard & Poor’s ratings agency raised the country’s credit rating. The dollar fell to 1,176.03 won from 1,186.32 won Tuesday in Tokyo. 
 
The greenback also fell to Sg$1,3997 from Sg$1.4035, to 4.2513 Malaysian ringgit from 4.3053 ringgit, to 46.67 Philippine pesos from 46.77 pesos, and to Tw$32.50 from Tw$32.57. 
 
However, it rose to 66.4375 Indian rupees from 66.4373 rupees, and to 36.00 Thai baht from 35.98 baht. 
 
The Australian dollar bought 71.61 US cents Wednesday in Tokyo, up from 71.22 on Tuesday and well up from the six-year lows below 69 cents touched last week. 
 
The Chinese yuan fetched 18.88 yen against 18.18 yen.

Citizens Property Insurance has already passed 1 million insurance policies to private carriers since 2012, and another surge is coming over the next four months, Citizens CEO Barry Gilway said. 
 
Gilway told Citizens board of governors Wednesday that there will be enormous action in October and November, and he foresees a very strong January coming for offers from private carriers to ""take out"" Citizens policies. 
 
""Takeout activity is just going on at an unprecedented pace,"" Gilway said. 
 
The state-run insurer is down to 586,000 policies and has a nearly $7.5 billion surplus to help pay storm claims. By the end of the year, Gilway predicted, tens of thousands of more policies will move to the private market. 
 
By the end of 2016, Citizens projects it will be down to 450,000 policies or fewer.

A high-level meet to be chaired by Chief Minister Oommen Chandy here on Thursday will try to resolve the latest bottlenecks in the implementation of the Kochi Metro Rail project, including the dispute between the Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA) and St. Albert’s College over land usage and the remaining land acquisition hurdles before the State’s ambitious venture. 

The work on Kochi Metro’s International Stadium station and adjacent pillars had been affected after the GCDA insisted on the State government handing over land near the first Goshree bridge to compensate for the 65 cents it had to give to St. Albert’s College in the stadium. 

N. Venugopal, Chairman of the GCDA, said on Wednesday that the authority was ready to hand over the land to St. Albert’s but on a condition that the government should give GCDA 72 cents near CMFRI located next to the first Goshree bridge. 

“We will also bring the unilateral stance adopted by the college authorities in this issue before the Chief Minister at the meeting,” he said. KMRL sources said other issues to be discussed at the meeting included the deadlock over the transfer of 17.31 acres owned by the Public Works Department at Kakkanad; approval for the water transport project for funding from KfW, the German funding agency; and approval of the Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (UMTA) Act. 

Mr. Chandy will also unveil the interior and exterior designs of Kochi Metro coaches along with the new brand identity of KMRL at CIAL on Thursday.

6548,"Dr. Mitchell  Food & Beverage Siberia or the Promised Land?  By Brian  Mitchell , Principal, Mitchell Performance Systems  
Co-authored by Evan Mitchell, Senior Consultant, Mitchell Performance Systems 
 
According to the Spanish proverb “Love, pain, and money cannot be kept secret.  They soon betray themselves.” And who could argue?  But closely observe an evening’s happenings in any fine dining venue, in any city, any country, (in your own establishment) and that list would be sadly incomplete.  You would want to add lust, gluttony, pride – in fact all of the deadly sins – along with style, taste, boorishness, timidity, loneliness, and pleasure (of course). 
 
There’s a secret world that waits to come alive in the dining experience of your customers. And it’s full of psychological expectations, urges, and tensions. 
 
With its fois gras and truffles, its champagne and soufflé, sauternes and cognac...  its stylish accoutrement, fine dining presents itself as the well-bred face of hedonism. But beneath this elegant exterior lurk psychological tendencies that can upset the most careful evening’s plans. This is part of the magic of dining, its unpredictability. Dining often brings what’s least expected. And while we can’t control or predict the kind of outcome a customer will experience, we can learn to recognize the factors that will influence it. 
 
The “fine” in fine dining has changed a lot of late. Not so surprising that something as trend-sensitive as food and wine will have to move with the times. The traditional Michelin image can seem now a little fusty and old fashioned, though eminently better than some new fads-for-fad’s sake. Still, though, the style of 3-courses, everyone makes their own selection, courses all brought out together… this status quo has been well and truly challenged by molecular gems originating from Spain, or foraged finds with a Scandinavian sensibility, or even street food  gone high-end. Style, format, ingredients, order of dishes, service imperatives – while these have changed as they’ve needed to change, the essence of dining, of hospitality, that remains what it has always been. 
    
There’s nothing quite like dining for revealing human nature in all its shades. Because an evening’s dining is first and foremost a psychological experience. It may start with the simple prospect of appetite and taste, but from there it can range almost anywhere, depending on the dynamic factors in play at and around the table. There’s seduction, satisfaction, celebration, one-upmanship, obligation, experimentation, expectations exceeded, illusions shattered, confidences shared and impressions kept to oneself. 
 
And it all Begins with Seating. 
 
We know that a raft of secret seating rules determines where in the dining room customers will end up – and why. Would knowing these make your patrons more accepting of their fate, or more resentful? 
 
In an ideal world, every section of the dining room and every table in every section would have its own charm, its own appeal, its own reasons for customers to be glad to be there. Surely with what’s spent in layouts, restaurant designers could make this so. Fact is, it just doesn’t work that way. Practicalities of space inevitably present their own obstacles, and creative layout and design can only do so much. 
 
Consider tables for four along the windows, or even an elegant banquette – very choice.  And the twos set just back from them still providing a relatively uninterrupted view across the street and out over the water. Best of all, the raised section that affords view and conspicuous elevation. How does the side section receding towards the kitchen compare? Or the other room in back of the bar?  Somebody has to be sat there – more than a few, in fact, on any given night. You are a business after all. But it’s not even so much these factors. What really creates inequality between spaces and sections and tables is good old, bad old human nature. 
 
Siberia it’s often called in the trade – the least desirable section in the restaurant. And it is a gulag back there. Not because – well, not in any decent place – not because it’s a cluster of wonky tables wedged between the toilets and a passageway the kitchen hands use for dragging out the garbage. It’s not, but it doesn’t have to be for a diner to feel they’ve been exiled beyond mattering. It’s the sense of exile itself that plays on the diner’s mind. 
 
So while it’s not that dreary, really, that’s how it’ll be perceived – unless a different picture is painted. Some diners may have a soft spot for a more isolated section. It’s calm, some might even call it cozy. It’s removed from the relentlessly competing egos brimming over in the supposedly more desirable sections. And as to the quality of food – you’ll get no less there than at any other table. But this kind of event is about more than the meal. It’s about a wider entitlement. And while some are happy they’ve received that, others can feel they’ve missed out – been sidelined for reasons that are in themselves a slight. Plenty of diners get their greatest satisfaction from the table they’ve been given. But plenty more want what they haven’t got. 
 
Managing that difficult match is our challenge. And it starts with a dining concept – Siberia isn’t a place so much as a state of mind. 
 
This principle extends beyond what location’s thought to be dreary. Power tables, too, are as much a psychological perception as an inherently physical one. Every bistro and brasserie, or café for that matter, has tables that are more or less desirable and sought after. But there’s a difference between getting a good table, and being publicly anointed. And getting a perceivably poor table, and being seemingly publicly shamed. Or, even subtly more shaming – seeming to be anointed, only to see another group anointed even more. 
 
Truth be told, the power table doesn’t really exist. It’s a myth that’s become industry doctrine through Chinese whispers and steady reinforcement. 
 
The process of canonizing a power table may go something like this. Seven tables on a raised section – four set back against the wall, three forward of those, no discernible differences in the view. Each offers equal opportunity to see and be seen. What could determine the order of preference among these seven tables? Well, the law of dining dictates that one must be more desirable. Say this night a well-known actor and his party have it, the power table. His agent specifically requested it. And she did so because a famous director was known to insist that he sit only there. And he settled on his preference after hearing two producer heavyweights discuss its merits. And one of these only sat there originally after his wife decided it was the spot she liked best. So tradition (of a sort) and gossip and a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy have over time given that table greater luster than its fellows. As we know, perception is everything. 
 
But perceptions can also be influenced. 
 
Siberia or the promised land? The contrary ends of the dining continuum – physically and mentally. It’s a fact of restaurant life, and one thing couldn’t be more apparent – the recognition that while all your customers are dining at the same establishment, all seated and choosing from the same menu and wine list, the potential will always be there for some diners to feel less equal than others. 
 
Given the realities and constraints of restaurant layout, how equal the diners at any table feel will depend on how professionally a maitre d’ and floor staff create and manage their expectations. 
 
Your staff can play up the not-immediately-apparent merits as the guests are sat – “lovely and quiet, away from the bustle…”, “this is the choice spot for a little privacy…”, “you can look over the whole room…”, “X, Y. Z (insert celeb, reality TV star or Kardashian-equivalent of choice) just loves it back here…”
To be honest, this is something not done enough in all aspects of the service situation – reinforcing the merits of a choice of food or wine, extolling its virtues to excite expectations, raising that dish, wine, or even table in the eyes of everyone at that table. 
 
This will not, unfortunately, always serve to erase all disgruntlement with where a group has been sat. Hopefully, however, it will have taken the edge off. The onus in now on everyone attending to that table to give that little bit extra. Not in ostentatious Cecil B DeMille ways, but in the small things that play to true hospitality, the little attentions that take little time but mount up to give a genuine sense of service “over and above”. 
 
“Turning a table around” isn’t always an easy thing. What is easy, however, is for front of house management, maîtres d’ and shift supervisors to create in their staff a sense of the importance of “turning a table around”. Of accepting a diner’s initial prickliness, and transforming that into memories of a great experience as they depart. 
 
This should, in any truly professional member of the floor team, be one of the greatest points of professional pride.
And one more motivation for staff, since there’s truth to the old adage of only backing the horse called “self-interest” (it’ll be the only one trying) – really turning a Siberian table around invariably ends in a cracking tip.

3926,"Leaked 2014 material reveals interpreters, experts and social helpers not hired ‘on proper terms’ meaning welfare and value-added tax (VAT) not paid 

France’s justice ministry has promised to take action after an investigation leaked in the press found it had hired more than 40,000 undeclared casual workers. 

The 2014 report, obtained by the satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine, found that 50,000 “occasional public service workers” had not been hired on proper terms, meaning contributions to France’s welfare system or value-added tax (VAT) were not paid.",fac1ed2e-1abe-4c09-8a88-bf7e0f50e485,News,2015-09-02T01:09:16Z,ACQ Magazine,"French justice ministry hired 40,000 undeclared workers, report finds",0.0,News
4866,"A Rosetown man has learned just how powerful social media can be, after he used Facebook to return a lost ukulele to its owner. 
 
Last Thursday Blair Wingert was driving back home to Rosetown from a houseboating trip in British Columbia's Shuswap area. 
 
At Sicamous, he picked up a hitchhiker, who rode as far as Calgary. When the friendly young man got out, he left his ukulele behind. 
 
Wingert only knew him by his first name, Thomas. 
 
""I figured social media was probably the best way to get a hold of him,"" Wingert said. 
 
He had taken a photo of the hitchhiker with his smartphone, so he posted it on his Facebook page right away in an effort to track him down and return his instrument. 
 Tens of thousands of shares  
By Sunday night, it had around 60,000 shares Wingert said. At last count, the number was 88,269. 
 
Monday night he saw a message from Thomas, although he almost missed it among the avalanche of friend requests he was also getting. 
 
""I think I had over 400 friend requests from people all over the world that I don't even know,"" Wingert explained.  
 
As he scrolled through the requests, he saw ""Thomas"" and clicked on it, and it was the fellow he was looking for. 
 
It turns out Thomas Besenski lives in Calgary. He's going to pick up his ukulele on an upcoming trip east, when he passes through Rosetown. 
 
Wingert said he's not surprised he was able to find Besenski through Facebook, but ""was surprised at how quickly it (the photo) got shared and how many shares it got."" 
 
If he didn't have Facebook, Wingert said he would have tried an online classified ad site such as Craig's List or Kjiji. But he's not sure the results would have been the same.",c0b3a017-97a9-47cb-8a21-ef3244ef6385,News,2015-09-03T03:18:26Z,CBC,Rosetown man learns power of Facebook in search for mystery hitchhiker,0.0,News

6639,"Cotton futures were sent swinging – but ended only marginally
changed - after a caution over world cotton demand took the heat out of a
lower-than-expected estimate for domestic stocks. 

 
The market's immediate reaction to the US Department of Agriculture's
monthly Wasde crop report was to send futures up 3% back into positive
territory, after the key number that investors were looking for, on US
inventories, came in at 3.20m bales. 

 
While up 100,000 bales month on month, reflecting a lower
estimate for abandoned acres, the figure was short of the 3.65m bales that
investors had expected. 

 
The estimate was ""well below market expectations"", Louis
Rose at the Rose Report noted. 

 
'Less supportive' 

 
As an extra support for futures, the USDA lowered its estimate
for Brazilian production, by 300,000 bales to 6.7m bales, citing the knock-on
effects of the weak real in denting sowings hopes. 

 
""Although the value of cotton increases with the
devaluation, the costs of production have also increased due to the rising
costs of fertilizers and pesticides,"" the USDA said 

 
However, December futures lost ground to close just 0.1%
higher at 63.13 cents a pound after attention turned to data on world
consumption, for which the forecast for 2015-16 was cut by 1.21m bales to 113.44m
bales. 

 
""At the aggregate world level the numbers were less
supportive,"" Mr Rose said. 

 
'Demand concerns' 

 
The USDA said ""concerns about weak consumer demand"" were
undermining its cotton use hopes, with the deceleration in consumption growth ""most
notable"" in Indonesia, India, and Thailand. 

 
In East Asia, including the ley Chinese market, ""consumption
is forecast flat, especially as Chinese consumption projections are unchanged"",
the department said. 

 
""Accumulating yarn stocks, reduced yarn margins, and
uncertainties regarding income growth in developing countries are indicative of
the challenges currently facing global cotton consumption."" 

 
The forecast for world cotton stocks at the close of 2015-16
was raised by 1.21m bales to 106.26m bales. 

 
'Supportive view' 

 
The USDA also lowered by 2.0 cents, to 56.0-58.0 cents a
pound, its forecast for US cotton prices in 2015-16. 

 
Mr Rose nonetheless said that the data overall were ""supportive
to somewhat bullish"" for New York cotton futures. 

 
Rabobank too said it was maintaining a ""supportive view for
cotton futures from current levels"", flagging the potential for production
downgrades outside the US, given the weak Indian monsoon and the potential for
EL Nino causing further weather upsets.",203dd57e-4161-4141-b637-cb8f9d71b5cf,News,2015-09-11T20:06:27Z,Agrimoney.com,Cotton futures sent swinging by contrary crop data,0.0,Blog

3274,"Andy Murray tumbled out of the US Open and was one racquet down after losing his temper during the fourth-round defeat to Kevin Anderson. 
 
The Scot let out a string of expletives during the break between the second and third sets, seemingly frustrated by the time Anderson was taking in a break off the court. 
 
Then after dropping serve in the third set, he smashed a racquet on the court, breaking it beyond repair and handing it to a spectator as an unexpected souvenir. 
 
Speaking about the tension in the match, Murray later said:  ""In the second set I felt like I was starting to put pressure on him there. When I had the break point at 5-3, I had a backhand pass that I really should have made. When you're playing against players that are at that level, like him, you need to obviously make them think and then give them a chance to get nervous. 
 
""The beginning of the fourth set, as well, I think it was his first service game, I had 15-all, hit a drop shot, mid-court forehand, then ended up winning the next couple of points. 
 
""I felt like I had my opportunities there but didn't manage to capitalise on them. When you're playing against someone as good as him, you know, it's tough."" 
 
Big-serving South African Anderson played the match of his  life to win 7-6 (7/5) 6-3 6-7 (2/7) 7-6 (7/0). 
 
Anderson has been helped by a sports psychologist and believes he has been able to keep his composure and focus in high-pressure matches because of that off-court guidance. 
   
 Share article  
   
He said: ""I think especially at this level, there's such fine details. I think a lot of the physical side, obviously I'm working on that. But I felt just from the mental side, being as neutral as possible in these big match-ups, somebody just to talk through, you know, sort of understands how I think and stuff has definitely been a huge benefit for me. 
 
""I definitely feel even though it's a gradual process, I feel like I'm on the right path and making good decisions.""",6a9510a1-cc94-46f3-a1f4-05f1f0656bdf,News,2015-09-08T10:34:30Z,Epsom Guardian,Andy Murray loses his cool and smashes racquet in US Open defeat,0.0,News
2355,"Wales head coach Warren Gatland has made three injury-enforced changes for Thursday's World Cup Pool A clash against Fiji in Cardiff. 
 
Bristol full-back Matthew Morgan replaces Liam Williams, who is recovering from concussion, while centre Tyler Morgan replaces knee injury victim Scott Williams and wing Alex Cuthbert takes over from Hallam Amos, who is sidelined from the rest of the tournament with a shoulder problem. 
 
It is otherwise the same team that beat England at Twickenham three days ago, with James Hook, who was called into the squad as a replacement on Monday, named among the replacements.

Gatland retains the pack on duty against England, with flanker Dan Lydiate and number eight Taulupe Faletau both winning their 50th caps. 
 
Matthew Morgan, 23, and 20-year-old Tyler Morgan make their first World Cup starts as Wales look to take another major step towards the quarter-finals, with Gatland's selection reflecting the huge importance of Thursday's game. 
 
Tyler Morgan missed out on original World Cup selection but was then drafted in as a replacement for Cory Allen, who suffered a tournament-ending hamstring injury after scoring three tries against opening opponents Uruguay. 
 Must keep up momentum  
Victory for Wales would put them within touching distance of the last-eight, and also leave England having to beat Australia at Twickenham on Saturday or the host nation will suffer an embarrassing pool stage exit. 
 
""It is important we build on the success and momentum from last weekend and take that into Thursday,"" Gatland said. 
 
""Fiji have performed very well in their opening two games, and they will be coming to Cardiff looking to build on that themselves. 
 
""We have made three changes through injury, but go into this game with a strong side. 
  
""We are looking forward to being back at the Millennium Stadium on Thursday and having the crowd right behind us in an important World Cup fixture."" 
  

 Injury woes  
Apart from beating Fiji, Wales will also hope they can emerge unscathed in terms of injuries, with Australia looming at Twickenham nine days later. 
 
Gatland has so far lost almost a sixth of his original 31-man World Cup squad through injury - a casualty count comfortably higher than any other team - with Amos and Scott Williams following Allen, full-back Leigh Halfpenny and scrum-half Rhys Webb in being sidelined from the tournament. 
 
Hook apart, the bench is unchanged from that on duty at Twickenham last Saturday, with again no place in the match-day 23 for Ospreys prop Paul James, who went off with calf muscle trouble during the Uruguay game.

BRISTOL BOROUGH >> Save the date! The 39th Annual Historic Bristol Day, sponsored by the Bristol Cultural & Historical Foundation on Saturday, Oct. 17, celebrates the diversity of Bristol’s history. 

BCHF is a non-profit organization dedicated to preserving over three centuries of Bristol’s history and increasing cultural opportunities for all residents of the community, promoting pride which translates into helping and enhancing the treasure that has been inherited. 

Diversity encompasses all the different elements of the human races, such as ethnicity, gender, nationality, gender identity and status, as well as citizenship, religion, age, ability and socio-economic status, experiences, viewpoints and backgrounds. The word diversity has become a popular topic for academic clarifications as well as routine dining room conversation. To value diversity is to respect each human’s worth. Acknowledging diversity requires acceptance on all levels. 

A community is strengthened when it recognizes and appreciates, understands and embraces the varied backgrounds. Everyone can contribute and benefit from the broad spectrum of unique human qualities. Diversity is the energy that enlivens our very colorful environment where everyone just lives and works together and no character is insignificant. 
 
Each day, Bristol Borough celebrates centuries of American life, the stories of ordinary people from diverse backgrounds who have worked together for generations to build an extraordinary town. 

Historic Bristol on the Delaware has been a site of recreational venues for centuries. The Historic Bristol Day events celebrated along Radcliffe Street and various parts of the Borough’s Cultural Corridor on the third Saturday of October, are the most reminiscent of the great fairs held in the town during the colonial period. 

Mark your calendar for the 39th Annual Historic Bristol Day of Diversity on Saturday, Oct. 17. This is one event each year that you will put on your calendar in ink rather than pencil because the BCHF goal, as always, is to produce a top tier event that is enjoyable and most exciting for every visitor. 

HBD Chairperson Elizabeth “Liz” [McCarry] Fisher suggested this year’s theme “Diversity” to celebrate all the backgrounds. “All the families have lived and worked together.” 

Her family celebrated St. Patrick’s Day every year at Howley’s Bar that was located on the corner of Washington and Pond streets. The late Thomas, born in Swinford, County Mayo, Ireland and his wife, Marjorie [McGee] Howley, were the owners/operators of that bar for 26 years, prior to its closing in 1996. Thomas was the last to survive of 10 brothers and sisters. 

Diversity provides a lesson for each of us to accept people for who they are and be open with things that set us apart – race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, physical and mental ability and language. “Growing up in the mill town of Bristol left only fond memories even though no one was very affluent.” Sidney Lawrence “Sid” Taylor confirmed, “Everyone got along as kids, everyone got along pretty good. Being a kid was fun. I had fun every day and I enjoyed myself! The diversity was beautiful.” Continued... 
  Sid, the former president of the African American Historical Cultural Society of Bucks County, led the effort to raise about $140,000 to bring the 6-foot tall Harriet “Hat” [Ross] Tubman monument to Lions Waterfront Park in 2006. 
“Diversity is the one true thing we have in common.” Now that’s something to embrace. 

The Margaret R. Grundy Memorial Library will present an audio-visual exhibit celebrating Bristol’s diversity entitled, “Every Person Has a Story. What’s Yours?” 

How many times have you enjoyed the opportunity to hear, “I remember when…?” 

Stop. Look and listen to Bristolians tell stories of growing up in this historic town. 

The exhibit will open at the library on Thursday, Oct. 1 and continue throughout the month. 

Experience the heart and discover the small-town Bristol on the Delaware history, hospitality and happiness and the great foods. Food and dance will be emphasized at Historic Bristol Day. Look for BCHF’s Bake Sale table! 

Whether you visit during a parade or a festival when the streets are brimming with activity, or take in the simpler life while sitting on a bench near the postcard-perfect Victorian gazebo in the waterfront Bristol Lion’s park, you will always be welcome.

The Chicago Cubs are none too happy with AC/DC.

Apparently there were some Dirty Deeds done at historic Wrigley Field when the band played a show there last Tuesday, and not all of them occurred on stage.

""Since the AC/DC concert we’ve had a little bit of trouble,"" Chicago Cubs manager Joe Maddon told ESPN. ""I don’t know if they [the band] were out there taking ground balls in 9-inch heels.""

Still, Maddon's comments came after the Cubs won a game against the Brewers on Monday night, so it can't be all bad, can it?

""They totally messed up our infield,"" Maddon said.

The outfield isn't without controversy either. The grounds crew at Wrigley replaced the grass that was out there during AC/DC's Rock or Bust tour stop with brand new sod, but according to ESPN, a number of players have expressed concern over the condition of the field.

5072,"Back to school has always been an emotionally charged time for me. While I was teaching it is the bittersweet end of Summer paired with a slew of new beginnings.   Now that I am at home with my kids, I eagerly await back to school after three weeks of down time between school and camp. But I also am not always ready to say goodbye to the daytime adventures and outings I have with my kids or the long summer afternoons at the pool that are not yet hindered by the need for early bedtime on a school night. This year my oldest began first grade and we were both feeling stressed. With first grade comes homework and the end of early childhood. When the first day of school ended with a two hour long quest for a lost bus that could not be located or contacted, my stress level was through the roof! Lucky for me I had the opportunity to unwind with a massage at Massage Envy Spa River Edge located in River Edge, NJ. 
 
 
 
I was completely new to the Massage Envy franchise, but the white glove treatment that I received even before I received my massage left me feeling highly optimistic about the experience. I was contacted by the extremely courteous and professional Sabrine Din who spoke with me about my hopes for my massage experience. She was extremely receptive to everything that I had to say and helped me devise a plan that would best suit my needs. As a mother of three young children, the youngest of which insists on being held as much as possible,   I was in need of some relaxation with some extra focus on the back and shoulders.   Sabrine made sure my request for a female massage therapist was fulfilled and even explained the modest draping procedures to me.  
 
When I arrived at the shopping center that housed   Massage Envy Spa River Edge, I was not quite sure how spa like my experience was going to be.   My doubts were promptly pushed aside as Sabrine greeted me and ushered me into a lovely and serene waiting room. As I filled out paper work about my medical history and massage preferences I enjoyed the Zen ambiance with delicate lighting, comfortable furnishings and soothing music.   Sabrine came to speak with me again and helped create a relaxing environment while my excitement built.   I would also be the lucky recipient of a sugar foot scrub! 
 
When I met Karon, my massage therapist, we discussed which body parts I wanted included and excluded, any pain I was having and what I was hoping for.   The massage room was cool and the ambiance level was high. It was cozy, inviting and relaxing. There was a comfortable table that felt like a bed and a plush blanket over the sheet . The customizability of my massage continued as Karon asked me what level pressure I preferred and checked in with me as she switched body parts that the pressure was alright.   I was quickly able to relax as Karon did an outstanding job balancing friendliness with limited conversation to ensure that I had the most relaxing experience possible. 
 
The massage itself was excellent. Karon made sure I was comfortable the entire hour long session and I was truly able to relax at an entirely new level. My sore and tense body parts from working out and carrying children quickly let go of any tension and I felt great.   The sugar foot scrub, available in both lavender and unscented, was icing on the cake for my feet and toes that needed some TLC from a summer of flip flops and running shoes.     
 
While the purpose of my massage was for relaxation, Massage Envy does offer many types of massages and treatments. An older woman in chronic pain entered the spa while I was leaving and Sabrine and the staff were doting and attentive to her specific needs.   I believed that a plan could be created for anyone’ s needs as I was presented with a summary of my appointment as well as recommendations for next time.   For   those of you lucky enough to go for massages on a regular basis, Massage Envy does offer monthly memberships that provide you with discounts and other benefits. If only I could cancel my gym membership and go for massages instead…… 
 
 All in all, Massage Envy Spa River Edge left me extremely relaxed and happy with my experience. I would definitely go back there for another massage. The entire staff was attentive, professional and caring. It was wonderful from start to finish and left me feeling amazing.  
 
Thank you to Massage Envy for providing complimentary services in exchange for an honest review.

NEW YORK, N.Y. - Stephen Colbert — the real guy, not the Comedy Central character — officially takes over for the retired David Letterman as host of CBS' ""The Late Show"" on Tuesday night. 

Announced guests for opening night are George Clooney and Jeb Bush. CBS is even giving Colbert extra time, saying the show will finish 9 minutes over the usual hour. 

Colbert has retired the political talk-show host character he portrayed on ""The Colbert Report"" for the platform on television's most-watched network. He'll be in direct competition with the two Jimmys, ratings leader Jimmy Fallon on NBC's ""Tonight"" show and ABC's Jimmy Kimmel. 

CBS has renovated the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York after Letterman and his team left last May to give Colbert a fresh start. 

Colbert teased the show with occasional comic routines released online over the summer, and turned up unannounced to host a talk show on Michigan public access television, with Eminem as guest. 

He's expected to give a spotlight on his first show to his new bandleader, Jon Batiste, and his group Stay Human. 

Presidential contender Bush can expect to be teased by Colbert for sending out a fundraising letter auctioning off a seat in the audience for Tuesday's first show, which CBS said had been done without the network's knowledge. Typically, these shows provide guests with a handful of free tickets to distribute. 

The guest list for Colbert's first week of shows indicates he plans to get beyond the typical show biz patter of many talk shows. Vice-President Joe Biden will visit Thursday and the CEOs of Tesla Motors and Uber will also make appearances. Comic Amy Schumer, actress Scarlett Johansson and author Stephen King are also on the schedule.

5455,"The Australian Catholic University has built up its North Sydney campus with a new purchase. The Australian Catholic University is expanding its higher education and research presence in North Sydney with the purchase of an older-style office building at 33 Berry Street.

The price was not disclosed. However, market speculation indicates a value of about $100 million for the 13-storey site on the prime corner of Pacific Highway and Berry Street.

Colliers International's Henry Burke and Jon Chomley​ advised in the sale and declined to comment on the price.

Private investor Horaco Property had bought the property in 1994 for about $24 million.

The acquisition of the property, which was keenly sought-after by developers for potential residential conversion, will allow the ACU to cut the cost of leasing space in the area as it meets demand from a growing student population.

ACU chief operating officer Stephen Weller said there had been a 53 per cent increase in student numbers at the university's North Sydney campus over the past three years.

Staff numbers had also increased by 35 per cent in the same period.

""ACU's expansion reflected the university's overall strategic plan for sustainable growth and the purchase consolidated its place as part of North Sydney's thriving education precinct,"" Mr Weller said.

Mr Burke said being fully leased and with a mixed-use zoning, there was strong interest from investors and developers but the ACU property requirements prevailed.

In its latest research, Colliers International said the suburbs had come alive amid demand for office space because of the shrinking supply in capital cities prompted by the increased developer appetite for residential conversions.

Sales in the metropolitan markets, including the city fringes, have reached about $2.8 billion. Offshore investors have bought about $2.63 billion worth and private investors about $1.15 billion.

Colliers International's associate director of research, Anneke Thompson, said the demand for metropolitan office investments was strongest in Sydney, where in the 2015 financial year, metropolitan office sales volumes outperformed Melbourne CBD sales volumes. Colliers International's managing director of capital markets and investment sales, John Marasco​, said in North Sydney, four office assets were sold to Chinese investors for a total of almost $500 million in 2015.

Mr Marasco said all the buyers were major Chinese institutions. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.",f0f73947-06f5-4b57-81ed-1d53a7847239,News,2015-09-15T14:15:00Z,The Hepburn Advocate,Australian Catholic University shows faith in North Sydney with campus buy,0.0,Blog
6183,"SLIMBRIDGE manager Leon Sterling was glad that his side managed to keep their FA Cup run intact on Tuesday night when they beat Egham Town in a preliminary round replay at Wisloe Road but insists they must improve a lot on their performance. 
 
A late Adam Mace belter that added to a couple of great Sam Blackie strikes saw the Swans into the first qualifying round where they will play Greenwich Borough in Dartford on Sunday week. 
 
The schedule is chaotic for Slimbridge, who are home to Didcot Town in the Evo-Stik Southern League Division One South and West on Saturday, a third game in a week after the original tie with Egham which ended in a 2-2 draw last weekend and now the replay. 
 
The players looked drained but happy on Tuesday night but Sterling said: “Cup games are about having a bit of luck. To be fair to them, they probably played better than us on the day. We kept in the game and in extra time, it was a bit even because, when you get to that stage, it is a bit of a knife-edge. 
 
“We managed to get the winner and we are ecstatic. But we know we have to play better than that but in a cup game, you score more goals and you are through. So hopefully we will improve in a couple of weeks time (against Greenwich).” 
   Promoted stories   
It was a great build-up for Mace’s winner, which came a few minutes from the end, as Slimbridge built on their advantage of having an extra player when Egham striker Jon Hippolyte was sent off near the end for a terrible tackle on Slimbridge’s Sam Turl. 
 
Sterling said: “We did not play well until extra time and luckily for us, we were still in the game so we managed to get it right in the thirty minutes and get the goal. 
 
“They probably ran out of steam with ten men and luck went our way today. You make your own luck but I think we were lucky.” 
 
And he admitted that having 11 men on the pitch against ten was always going to help when the business end of the match came along. 
 
“The extra man is always going to tell. They got tired and did not have the subs. We put our subs on (in the second half) and that freshness gives you a little bit of edge. I thought the three subs who came on for us gave us energy to the team and that pushed us over the line.” 
 
Now it is another quick turnaround to the Didcot Town league clash on Saturday, and Sterling admitted they were exhausted from two tough cup ties and 210 minutes of intense football. 
 
“They went into the changing room and I said congratulations but they know my feelings on where they can improve on. We have played well this season and not picked up points so sometimes, when you don’t play well, you just take the win. 
 
“They will be chuffed they have gone through, it is money for the club and they have another game in the FA Cup.”

3725,"From midriff-baring fairy cocktail waitresses, to succulent goulash, to flirty burlesque acts, classical music interludes, cameos by various 19th-century artistes and a ritualized serving of absinthe (the potent green liquor dubbed “the green fairy”), the new cabaret show “Bohemia” is in a realm of its own. 
 
As veterans of Cafe Nordo shows, “Bohemia” co-creators and performers Mark Siano and Opal Peachey certainly know their way around whimsical foodie theater. (“Bohemia” is performed at Nordo’s Culinarium, in Pioneer Square .) And given their previous piece, “Seattle Vice,” they have experience evoking bygone eras with music, humor and booze. 
 
But “Seattle Vice” was set in the familiar era of the mid-1960s, amid Emerald City gangsters and crooked coppers. “Bohemia” shuttles between different periods of the 19th century, between Paris and Prague, and between such notables as Polish composer Chopin, and Czech turn-of-the-century art nouveau artist Mucha. 
  Cabaret Review  ‘Bohemia’  
By Opal Peachey and Mark Siano. Through Sept. 27, at Nordo’s Culinarium, 109 S. Main St., Seattle. Tickets are $25-$80, depending on whether cocktails and/or dinner are included; (800-838-3006 or brownpapertickets.com) 
    
The central persona in this diverting, atmospheric whimsy bubble is another famous Czech, Antonín Dvorak (Siano). 
 Most Read Stories Marshawn Lynch's mom to Seahawks: Fire offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell Union suspends strike; school to start Thursday in Seattle Seattle police chief fires cop who arrested man carrying golf club So what happens now with Seahawks' Kam Chancellor? Boeing starts final assembly of its first 737 MAX Unlimited Digital Access.  $1 for 4 weeks. 
Smarting over a nasty review in a Prague newspaper for one of his compositions, and lacking inspiration for his ninth symphony, Dvorak goes on an absinthe binge. 
 
In a hallucinatory haze he communes with the ghosts of artists past and present. The lusty sprites who’ve been fetching your drinks are transformed into Dvorak’s fairy posse. They dance, do supple acrobatics with emerald silk drapes, pose suggestively. 
 
Sticklers for historical accuracy beware: the real Dvorak was a religiously pious family man, whose big indulgence was raising pigeons. And he wrote his best known work, Symphony No. 9 in E Minor (aka the New World Symphony) while living in the U.S. and (presumably) without any poetic mentoring from Frédéric Chopin (Peachey). 
 
And maybe the world-renowned actress Sarah Bernhardt (Cherry Manhattan) did perform a deliciously histrionic striptease for Mucha, as he painted her portrait. Somehow, I doubt it. 
 
So take “Bohemia” as both a freewheeling spoof of and ode to artistic romanticism. And on those grounds, it’s a beguiling, mildly naughty and well-provisioned evening. 
 
The cast is impressive, with all doing double (or triple) duty. Beside scripting, Siano and Peachey ably composed the music that isn’t by Chopin, Dvorak and Debussy, including a robust drinking song (“Nazdravi”). 
  
Favorite number: the clever “My Girl George.” In man’s suit and top hat, Peachey’s saucy Chopin duets with his cross-dressing (real-life) lover, novelist George Sand (Annastasia Workman). Then the fairies turn up in male garb to waltz along. 
 
Peachey and Siano are both proficient pianists and singers, and other instrumentalists pitch in. You marvel at the quick-change efficiency of the fluttering fairies. (Don’t forget to tip them.) And some of the costumes, by Montana Tippett with others, are resplendent. 
 
It’s a lengthy show, with space for appetizers, drinks and goulash. And it could do with better jokes about Bohemia the place vs. bohemians, and rather less blather about art with a capitol “A” and inspiration with a capitol “I.” 
 
As for the absinthe, do partake in the ritual if you can handle the ultra-intense taste of anise and the 136 proof kick. (You can also sip it in a less ferocious cocktail.) 
   
Any production that has an absinthe consultant gets a badge for uniqueness. As the Czech toast goes, “Na zdravi!”",b7bb9e6f-c6b3-4bb8-9ac6-c215842243bd,News,2015-09-16T18:10:01Z,Seattle Times,"‘Bohemia’: Antonín Dvorak like you’ve never seen him, at Cafe Nordo’s Culinarium Updated 4:40 pm",0.0,News

The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that  Didi Kuaidi quietly put money  into Lyft’s May funding round, along with Didi’s own backers Tencent and Alibaba. 
 
Alibaba had already been a Lyft investor, and Pando has detailed at length the  strange coalition  of billionaires, Asian corporates and hedge funds who are all backing the world’s major Uber competitors. There’s Softbank who is in GrabTaxi, Ola Cabs, and Didi. There’s Coatue who is in Didi, Lyft, and GrabTaxi. There’s Alibaba-- and apparently, secretly Tencent-- who is in Lyft and Didi. And the strangest twist yet: Didi  itself  is using it’s own venture capital to invest in  GrabTaxi  and now Lyft.

5814,"CAMPAIGNERS say they are prepared for a long fight to stop a nuclear power station opening at Bradwell. 
 
The Government has approved a £2billion guarantee to underwrite Chinese financing of the Hinkley Point nuclear power station, in Somerset. 
 
It paves the way for “majority Chinese ownership” of a power station at Bradwell. 
 
Andy Blowers, chairman of Mersea Island-based campaigners Blackwater Against New Nuclear Group, said Chinese involvement in the Bradwell site was not a surprise. 
 
He said: “We are not going to be able to stop this agreement, but there is a long way to go. 
 
“This has to be fought at a national level as well as a local level. This is only the first step on a very long march.” 
 
Mr Blowers said he would be writing to EDF Energy, the Chinese nuclear groups and the Government to reiterate concerns about the site, including the inability to cool water, the delicate nature of the estuary and the disposal of waste. 
 
He has previously described the scheme as a vanity project for the Government and claimed the Blackwater Estuarywould be trashed if the Chinese were given the green light to run a nuclear power plant. 
 
The site next to the old power station, which is being decommissioned, is owned by EDF Energy and is a “planned site” for nuclear development.

5417,"It’s never been easy being green, but over the last few years it’s gotten increasingly difficult. Between dropping fuel prices and rising SUV demand fewer consumers are shopping hybrids, driving the segment down over 18 percent in 2015 even as the overall new car market is up 4 percent. Toyota’s Prius, by far the most successful hybrid of all, is actually fairing better than most. It’s “only” down 17 percent this year (the Lexus CT is down 20 percent, the Ford C-Max is down 23 percent and the Honda CR-Z is down 30 percent). At Kelley Blue Book we’ve watched shopper interest in hybrids and alternative energy vehicles drop for over a year now. Does that make this the best or worst time for Toyota to introduce an all new 2016 Prius?

It doesn’t matter, because the new Prius is coming. Toyota unveiled it tonight in Las Vegas while touting a list of upgrades that range from better fuel efficiency to better driving dynamics. It’s also got a slightly larger body sporting a new exterior design. This is the most dramatic shift in the Prius’ look since the second-generation model debuted in 2003, but it’s still clearly a Prius. That’s probably a good thing, because even with the drop in volume over the past year Toyota still sells between 15,000 and 20,000 units a month. That’s more than the Kia Soul, Mazda 3, Subaru Impreza or Volkswagen Jetta, confirming an ongoing audience for the Prius even in the face of cheap gas and America’s growing love affair with the SUV.

Under its new look the 2016 Prius sits on a the Toyota New Global Architecture (or TNGA), which isn’t the most creative naming convention but does include benefits like a double wishbone rear suspension and lower center of gravity, both of which should give the new Prius better ride and handling characteristics. Drivetrain details remain unknown, though Toyota says fuel efficiency will increase by 10 percent. The new Prius will also feature the Toyota Safety Sense package of advanced technology, including a pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, lane departure warning, radar cruise control and automatic high beams. LED exterior lightings will also contribute to the new Prius’ safety pedigree.  PREVIOUS SLIDESLIDE 1 of 4NEXT SLIDE  It doesn’t matter, because the new Prius is coming.

After briefly sitting in the 2016 Toyota Prius we can confirm an improvement in seat comfort (particularly lateral support) along with upgraded control placement and visibility. The gauge cluster remains in the center of the dash and now has a brighter, full-color display. We’re not fans of the bright white interior panels around the shifter and center console, thinking these won’t work any better in the new Prius than they did in the old Chevrolet Volt (probably why they were removed during the Volt’s 2016 redesign). Panel color aside, the new Prius is clearly a step up in every way. These enhancements may not reverse the car’s waning demand, but if the new Prius simply stabilizes around 150,000 sales a year it will be among the best selling cars in a country where hybrid cars are increasingly difficult to sell.",e624822d-38eb-4f51-81ec-bc881e90daf7,News,2015-09-09T09:26:04Z,MSN News US,2016 Toyota Prius Hybrid: World's Least Dramatic Car Gets a Dramatic Makeover,0.0,Blog

4470,"Ericsson ConsumerLab TV & Media Report 2015 shows consumers embracing video on-demand services like never before; every third viewing hour now spent watching on-demand TV and video    Report reveals a 71 percent increase in watching video on smartphones since 2012; nearly two thirds of teenagers' total TV and video viewing time spent on a mobile device    Viewing user-generated content also on the rise; almost one in 10 watch YouTube for more than three hours per day   
Ericsson ( NASDAQ: ERIC ) has today launched the latest edition of the annual Ericsson ConsumerLab TV & Media Report, representative of the views and habits of 680 million consumers making it one of the largest studies of its kind. 
 
A key finding is that Video-on-Demand (VOD) services are succeeding in meeting consumer needs, thus allowing consumers to change their viewing habits. Consumers now spend six hours per week watching streamed on-demand TV series, programs, and movies - this has more than doubled since 2011. With recorded and downloaded content added to the equation, today 35 percent of all TV and video viewing is spent watching VOD. 
    

 
Further findings highlight the considerable growth in consumers watching video on a mobile device: 61 percent watch on their smartphones today, an increase of 71 percent since 2012. When taking tablets, laptops, and smartphones into consideration, nearly two thirds of time spent by teenagers' watching TV and video is on a mobile device. 
 

 
At the same time, user-generated content (UGC) platforms account for a growing share of consumers' TV and video viewing. Close to 1 in 10 consumers watch YouTube for more than three hours per day, and one in three now consider it very important to be able to watch UGC on their TV at home. In addition, the study finds that the increasing prominence of UGC-rich platforms, like YouTube, has resulted in a popularity boost for educational and instructional videos, with consumers watching an average 73 minutes of these videos per week. 
 
Anders Erlandsson, Senior Advisor, Ericsson ConsumerLab, says: ""The continued rise of streamed video on demand and UGC services reflects the importance of three specific factors to today's viewers: great content, flexibility, and a high-quality overall experience. Innovative business models that support these three areas are now crucial to creating TV and video offerings that are both relevant and attractive."" 
 
Other significant findings from the Ericsson ConsumerLab TV & Media Report 2015 include: 
 
Bingeing is changing the game : Watching multiple TV episodes in a row has rapidly become a key part of the TV and video experience. This habit is prominent among Subscription Video-on-Demand (S-VOD) users of services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and HBO, of whom 87 percent binge-view at least once a week. 
 
The difficulty of finding content : Half of consumers watching linear TV say they can't find anything to watch on a daily basis. Consumers feel that recommendation features are simply not smart or personal enough. 
 
Different bundles, different attitudes: Twenty-two percent of consumers who have never had a pay-TV subscription are already paying for over-the-top (OTT) content services. 
 
Linear TV remains key: The popularity of linear TV remains high, mainly due to the access it gives to premium viewing and live content, like sports, as well as its social value. In this respect, linear TV often acts as a 'household campfire'.

4249,"Investors are suffering from a nasty Fed-fueled hangover. 
 
U.S. stocks retreated on Friday as frustration mounts over the Federal Reserve's vague plans to lift interest rates. The Dow declined 290 points points. The S&P 500 declined 1.6%, while the Nasdaq declined 1.4%. 
 
The turmoil comes one day after the U.S. Fed announced that it was leaving its benchmark interest rate near 0%. Fed chief Janet Yellen said in explanation: ""The outlook abroad appears to have become more uncertain."" 
 
She was referring to the economic slowdown in China and its impact on the rest of the world, including the United States. 
 
However, the Fed's pronouncements -- and its focus on market turmoil -- had the effect of making investors even more nervous. Major stock markets in Europe, like Germany and France, fell over 2.5%. 
 
""What the Federal Reserve has done is increase uncertainty,"" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. ""The stock market always hates uncertainty."" 
 
Friday's selloff wiped out the stock market's gains for the week. The Dow is now down 8% on the year, while the S&P 500 is off 5%. Strong performance by tech and biotech stocks have kept the Nasdaq afloat. It's still up 2% this year. 
 
Investors weren't quite sure exactly what signals were going to guide the Fed in the coming months. 
 
The unemployment rate is already down to 5.1%, about half of where it was during the Great Recession. And the economy grew at a healthy clip of over 3% during the second quarter. 
 
Global market turmoil stayed its hand, the Fed said, even though the U.S. economy is growing nicely. 
 
The Fed seems to be waiting ""for ideal conditions that realistically never seem to arrive,"" Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of fundamental fixed income, wrote in note to clients. 
 
Banking stocks continue to reel in the wake of the Fed decision as hopes that higher rates would translate to fatter profits on loans have been dashed. Shares of Regions Financial, KeyCorp and SunTrust Banks retreated more than 3% apiece. 
 
Energy stocks are also sinking as crude oil plunged nearly 5% below $45 a barrel. Fears about global growth eating into oil demand have only been amplified by the Fed decision. 
 
Copper, another good gauge of economic sentiment, slid 3%.

4765,"Daikin Offers Worldwide Free Access to Patents for Equipment Using NextGeneration Refrigerant Tweet OSAKA, Japan and WASHINGTON and BRUSSELS, Sept. 10, 2015 /PRNewswireUSNewswire/ Daikin Industries, Ltd., the world's leading air conditioner and refrigerant manufacturer based in Osaka, Japan, announced today it is offering companies worldwide free access to 93 patents, to encourage companies to develop and commercialize air conditioning, cooling and heat pump equipment that use HFC32 as a single component refrigerant. Daikin's action is aimed at encouraging manufacturers worldwide to adopt sustainable comfort cooling and heating technologies that use HFC32, a refrigerant with a lower global warming impact than commonlyused refrigerants. HFC32 (difluoromethane) is a next generation refrigerant that addresses a range of environmental considerations in a balanced manner. It is a nonozone depleting substance, is energy efficient, affordable, is easier to recycle, and has a globalwarming potential (GWP) that is onethird of that of R410A, the most commonly used refrigerant. These advantages make it the most balanced and promising nextgeneration refrigerant solution to reduce the environmental footprint of residential and commercial airconditioning, cooling and heat pump equipment. 

The avoided carbon emission benefits of a transition to HFC32 would be very significant. If all presently used R410A refrigerant is replaced by HFC32, the total CO2 equivalent impact of HFCs could be reduced by up to 24% in 2030, compared to usiness as usual scenarios. ""Daikin has been offering free access to these patents in emerging markets since 2011 to accelerate the phaseout of ozonedepleting refrigerants, such as HCFC22,"" said Shinya Okada, Daikin's Senior Executive Officer. ""Given the urgent need to address climate change, Daikin believes that this is the right time to extend free access to these certain HFC32 equipment patents to manufacturers worldwide.""

There is no patent that covers the HFC32 chemical itself and it is readily available from suppliers other than Daikin. This free access to certain patents allows manufacturers to utilize Daikin's technologies for airconditioning, cooling and heat pump equipment using HFC32 single component refrigerant and encourages the global industry to grow responsibly as well as meet rising demand.

Conversion from highGWP refrigerants is already underway. Last year, the European Union enacted the revised Fgas regulation* to reduce the globalwarming impact of refrigerants. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is in the process of revising its regulations that establish acceptable alternatives for ozone depleting and high GWP refrigerants. In addition, Japan's Act on Rational Use and Proper Management of Fluorocarbons, which came into force in April 2015, encourages conversion from highGWP refrigerants. ""Sharing environmentally beneficial air conditioning technologies without royalty payments can speed up environmental gains at a time when fast action is essential for climate protection,"" said Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development. ""Free access to patented technologies sets a powerful precedent for other companies aiming to be environmental champions.""

Companies interested in obtaining access to these patents should contact Daikin Legal.

En tu cuerpo flor de fuego
Tienes paloma,
Un temblor de primaveras -Víctor Jara (“Deja la vida volar”)

Prologue:
In the sand grows a flower of fire.

Bell flower, Moonflower, 
a Brugmansia 
these are not that 
phantom bird of spring 

Women gather at the sea 
to forget with care 
their red vines 

White petals flow through 
salves of snow 
they flood the gulleys 
darting children call furrows 

I 
On the beach is a woman alone. 

A tourist,
maybe she will stay 

A poet, 
she has read the Canto General  
and prefers the osprey with an eel
in his mouth 

Those first eagles of the sea
their tongues fetch one dollar apiece 
just listen to their call, 
it sounds like the charango 

Tonight at the banquet 
it will be served.  

II
The Ambassador’s toast 
was lachrymose: 
She only had come to deliver milk 
and textbooks 
a stork bearing weight 
for all of the fallen doves  

His ascot was folded down 
upon his lapel 
which bore a pin of the peace.  

III
Men finely pressed 
mull in the plaza 
they’ve earned their threads 
as hired arms: 
a Cossack and a Gaucho
traded in their sharovary 
and polo belt 
to help renew the Mit’a
in the capital.   

At the bottom of your blood, corporal 
there is a great lavatory where 
I spy 
the adjutant’s braid; 
in small groups you gather beside   
the swinging doors 
sharing smokes and click-click-clicking 
your tongue in a 
tsi tsi tsi 
for those women in long skirts 
who’ve come to look for their disappeared.

IV
Recently my brother caught a crow
broke its wing 
and chained it to a stake 
in front of his barn 
he baits his dogs then waits 
I ask him why-

His hands still are red 
having come down off of the wall 
today, having birthed a calf 
between the iron filings 
of the corral 
his disposition is just not the same  

El cuervo is a spy 
he spats 
then laughs at the specter 
There are milkless children, manito 
who stone stray dogs 
and who is going to pay for all 
of that lost work? 

No, that bastard 
brother, he’s a boss.

Patrick Vieira, Mick McCarthy, Alf Inge-Haaland, Alan Shearer and Jason McAteer all fell foul of Roy Keane's piercing glare - or worse. 

And while Keane's beard didn't last long, his icy stare is not easily forgotten.  

Indeed, it seems an uncanny resemblance to the Irish firebrand has been giving the evil eye for centuries. 
 
Renaissance artist Paolo Veronese painted Portrait of Gentleman in a Fur sometime between 1550 and 1560

An internet wag likened the subject of Renaissance painter Paolo Veronese's Portrait of A Gentleman In A Fur to the Manchester United great. 

Sporting an ermine fur, the mystery man was painted circa 1550-60 by the Venetian artist,  one of the more prominent painters of his time.

5379,"On Sunday noon, Crimean Tatars and other activists from Ukraine blocked checkpoints at the administrative border between mainland Ukraine and occupied Crimea to prevent trucks with commodities from entering the peninsula.  
The blockade will be held in three stages / Photo from Ayder Muzhdabaev 
  
At least 1,000 people are expected to participate in the blockade of the administrative border with occupied Crimea on the first day of the campaign, according to leader of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People Refat Chubarov . 
 
""I expect at least about one thousand people will come today. These are those we know about. We are blocking all the three directions ‒ Kalanchak, Chaplynka and Chonhar (all in Kherson region, Ukraine) ‒ as of noon sharp,"" he said at a meeting prior to the launch of the blockade, according to Ukrainian news agency RBC Ukraine. 
 
Chubarov announced that the campaign would be held in three stages. ""A rally has begun. The rally is the first stage. There will be the second and third ones. As for duration and formats, we'll be in consultation with all those who have come here, with the headquarters and representatives of the Mejlis,"" he said. 
 
In his words, the campaign will depend on many factors. 
 
Chubarov also called on the Ukrainian Cabinet to address the issue of creating the so-called food hubs in Ukrainian territory close to the administrative border with occupied Crimea. In his words, this will allow entrepreneurs to work transparently, and money will remain in Ukraine, namely in Kherson region. 
 
As was earlier reported, the blockade concerns only trucks with goods running between Ukraine and Crimea. Thus, all the four roads will be blocked not to let their movement. However, the campaign will not concern individuals and passenger cars, which will be able to move freely. 
 
The leaders of the Crimean Tatars announced on September 8 that they would block the administrative border between mainland Ukraine and Crimea to prevent Ukrainian commodities from being delivered to the occupied peninsula.

1828,"( Family Features ) It’s time for sandwiches to move aside, because this school year bento-box style lunches reign king on campus. Bento boxes provide not only the space for healthy and nutritious food choices, but also creativity. Isn’t it time for lunch to be more fun? 
  
Nutrition blogger and mom of two, Sally Kuzemchak, uses Lil Snappers kid-sized fruit when she creates bento box lunches because they are easy for little students to hold, serving size proportionate and each 3-pound pouch provides enough fruit for lunches and snacks for an entire week. On top of that, the fruit can be sliced up for dipping in almond butter or yogurt sprinkled with cinnamon or cut up into a fruit salad, perfect for the three or four compartments in a bento box. 
 
Studies indicate healthy eating can influence the cognitive ability and intelligence levels of students, and balanced midday meals of fruits, proteins, carbohydrates and healthy fats are best. For a well-rounded lunch, parents can fill bento boxes with fresh pasta alongside sliced carrots and grapes, taco fixings with a Lil Snappers apple or a fun and creative meal-on-a-stick to keep school-aged children satisfied throughout the day. 
 
Preparing healthy, filling lunches shouldn’t be difficult, and with bento-box style meals your kids will never be bored. With a little preparation and recipe inspiration, crafting back to school lunches will be a breeze. For additional recipes and information, visit LilSnappers.com and look for them at your local grocery store.

Carnival, which claims to have pioneered year-round cruising from New Orleans in 1994, has become the port’s largest cruise operator over the past two decades with two ships offering more than 125 four- to seven-day departures annually. 
 
Currently, the 3,646-passenger Carnival Dream offers seven-day Caribbean cruises, while the 2,052-passenger Carnival Elation sails four- and five-day Mexican voyages from New Orleans. 
   Next spring, the 2,758-passenger Carnival will replace Carnival Elation to increase capacity on short cruises from New Orleans by 34%. 
“Carnival has a long and deep history with the city of New Orleans,” said Carlos Torres de Navarra, Carnival’s vice president of commercial port operations. “We not only enjoy a very successful New Orleans-based cruise programme, but strive to be valuable community partners providing strong economic impact and supporting a variety of philanthropic initiatives.",631f1545-a904-458c-a46d-be7aa6c3e148,News,2015-09-01T07:49:26Z,Bayou Buzz,"Carnival to carry record 450,000 passengers from New Orleans",0.0,Blog

So over the weekend I worked up these...
Knit with remnants - Debbie Bliss Baby Cashmerino and Rowan Baby Merino Silk for the toes, heels and cuffs. The pattern from this Debbie Bliss book.
Seems I didn't take a picture that shows their wee size - you'll have to take my word for it.
Teeny. Tiny. Which of course doesn't reflect the amusement factor in making them. BIG FUN. More fun, also newly arrived at the cottage over the weekend - Darling Daughter bearing a bag of yarn and a plan to knit an Alberta vest for a friend! Really BIG FUN! Well, the yarn - at least trim and main colour - really big, HUGE hanks of Cascade Eco Wool. Also really big but not fun at all - for anyone - and here I include the dog who could just feel the tension in the room - the challenge of helping her through a 1x1 rib tubular cast on. I tried to suggest something simpler but she was having none of it. Once past those 12 hours though - not joking here - 12! - the skills learned making that one scarf I pressed her to knit back in grade 7 seem to have stayed with her.  Freed of the pesky need to alternate knits and purls she's scooting along with lovely tension watching the Noro colours work their magic as she heads up the body in all-knit-all-the-time seamless circular knitting. (Alberta's neck and arm holes are steeked - so really no purling!) She took it with her to work hoping to get a stripe or two done over her lunch hour! Meanshile I'm happy to be back in the city with September-ready energy, drinking in all the new fall patterns as they come out this month.

OMAHA (DTN) -- It has become the question of the day for U.S. ethanol producers: What happens to the industry if crude oil prices continue to tumble? 
 
Lower corn prices are good for ethanol producers; lower gasoline prices at the pump, not so much. (Photo courtesy of Matt Merritt at Poet) 

Crude oil prices fell below $39 a barrel Monday for the first time since 2009, just ahead of the end-of-the-summer driving season and expected lower demand for gasoline to come. 
 
Though the price of crude oil is one of many factors ethanol producers watch -- along with the price of corn and other feedstocks -- to produce ethanol, a major impetus for the passage of the Renewable Fuel Standard in 2005 and an even more aggressive RFS in 2007 was the steady rise in crude oil prices that peaked at around $145 a barrel in 2008. 
 
Donna Funk, certified public accountant with K-Coe Isom in Lenexa, Kansas, who works with more than 10 ethanol plants, said producers are closely watching the crude market along with the current corn crop. 
 
""Yes, ethanol plants I talk to are definitely feeling the squeeze in margins,"" she said. 
 
""Financial results definitely vary depending on the location of the plant and the corn basis they are experiencing. I think producers are obviously watching crude, corn and gasoline prices daily as well as imports. I don't think they watch just crude prices as ethanol prices do not always follow crude directly. Commodity pricing can be as big a factor as crude prices if corn gets low enough, then crude can stay low."" 
 
Funk said ethanol producers are keeping a close eye on their production volumes and commodity prices with harvest approaching. 
 
""I think a lot of plants are focused on what they can do today with available cash, financing, etc., to distinguish themselves from a traditional corn starch ethanol plant so that they are in a different place in a year or so,"" she said. 
 
If crude, gasoline and ethanol prices continue to slide and demand doesn't increase, ""I think it is almost certain we will see plants slow down even more or shut down; this could also lead to more consolidation in the market,"" Funk said. 
 
MARGINS NARROW 
 
Ethanol margins in the past month or two already have been narrow to negative based on DTN's hypothetical ethanol plant. 
 
A bump in corn prices Monday pushed production costs at the hypothetical Neeley Biofuels ethanol plant higher, resulting in a net loss of 2.4 cents per gallon. The hypothetical plant is used to measure how changes in commodity markets might affect actual plant margins. 
 
DTN Analyst Rick Kment said margins have been hovering around breakeven for the past month or so. 
 
""The fact that corn prices are still well manageable with the national cash index value for corn under $3.50 is easing production costs and allowing plants to stay at breakeven or profitable levels even with lower gasoline and crude oil prices,"" he said. ""Even though crude oil prices have moved below $40 per barrel, the softness in gasoline prices has helped at least temporarily to maintain firm demand support across the country, allowing prices to stabilize."" 
 
Ethanol futures still are trading at a discount to the RBOB gasoline market, he said, ""Although the current discount is the narrowest level since January 2015."" 
 
If ethanol prices move to a premium to gasoline for a long period of time, Kment said, some moderate demand pressure is likely and could limit plant and product margins.",a918c4ce-a881-4fd5-83bc-e640358628cc,News,2015-09-18T13:32:57Z,Progressive Farmer,Crude Oil Pressures Ethanol,0.0,Blog

NEW YORK 
 
It was a day full of business for Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the second day of his six-day official visit to the United States. 
 
Media moguls of the world on Friday lined up to meet Modi here, followed by a series of bilateral meetings that he had with the leading CEOs of US-based companies. 
 
The Prime Minister gave a sneak-peak into the flagship programme of his government, aptly balancing India’s interest with expectations that the US Inc may have with the country of 1.3 billion people, a market which they are keenly looking at. 
 
The Prime Minister observed that the changes in technology in media in recent times have led to an enormous democratisation of knowledge. 
 
He said the world was now technology-driven society where growth of digital infrastructure is as important as the growth of physical infrastructure. He suggested to the CEOs that India represents both the biggest opportunity and the biggest challenge for them and urged them to keep regional languages in mind as they develop their content and as they firm their investment plans for India. 
 
He also spoke of the government’s vision for Digital India, the plan to connect 6,00,000 villages through broadband connectivity and he asked the CEOs to visualise the citizens of the 21st century and think about what values they will represent and what challenges they will face. 
 
Modi also spoke of the role that digital technology could play in human resource development and further strengthening democracy and in India’s development narrative. He also gave a number of suggestions to them in terms of how media and communications companies could be part of nation’s development story. One idea that he gave was that a communication university could be setup in the country, which could then help further progress in the areas that they are really interested in. 
 
The round table meeting on media, technology and communications, the growth story for India was attended by range of CEOs including Rupert Murdoch, the Executive Chairman of Newscorp and 21st Century Fox, his son James Murdoch, CEO of 21st Century Fox, Robert Thomson, CEO, Newscorp, Uday Shankar, CEO Star India, David Zaslav, President and CEO, Discovery Communications, Michael Lynton, CEO Sony Entertainment, Michael Roth, CEO Interpublic Group of Companies, Shane Smith, CEO, Vice Media, Martin Sorell, CEO, WPP, Jeff Bewkes, CEO, Time Warner, Nancy Dubuc, CEO, A+E Networks, Anthony Pratt, Chairman, Visy Industries, William Duhamel, Route One Investment Company and Jeff Ubben, CEO ValueAct Capital. 
 
As James Murdoch himself summed it up, 40 per cent of the world’s entertainment industry was present in that room and this was a combination of executives dealing with media and entertainment and also executives who are venture capitalist and investors in media related companies. 
 
After finishing the meeting with media honchos, Prime Minister had a series of bilateral meetings with the leading CEOs of US based companies. 
 
External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Vikas Swarup said in a media briefing that 42 of the world’s leading CEOs of Fortune 500 companies were together in that one room. “I was told that the net worth of all the companies put together is USD 4.5 trillion,” he said.",5a3e6c7a-562f-4524-aad5-b2972373a337,News,2015-09-25T20:20:13Z,Navhind Times,Modi hardsells India dream to America Inc,0.0,News

7741,"That’s a really odd comparison. 
 
The issue with photorealistic graphics is that they spend an utterly disproportionate part of the game’s budget. 
 
I am not aware of any games where sound-design spent a disproportionate amount of the game’s budget. 
 
Don’t get me wrong, I love photorealistic graphics (when they work, which is about 35% of the time, frankly – rather lower than the 60% or so of the time I’d say more stylized looks “work”), but it seems like a completely false analogy you’re making. Either that or you just don’t understand the problem. 
 
(A further issue is that photorealistic graphics tend to require increasingly expensive hardware – I know a lot of the writers here have £1200 quid+ computers, sometimes a lot more expensive than that, which absolutely makes sense for a game reviewer, but my main objection to the pursuit of these graphics, myself, is that they lead to games demanding more and more expensive hardware – we actually caught a break from that for a while, when non-photorealistic graphics were forced “into style” by the declining power of consoles compared to PCs, but it seems like the whole race has heated up again – maybe it’ll cool in a year or three as the consoles hit their maximum capability, but not before I’ve had to not buy games because I don’t have the £170+ quid graphics card and £700+ PC you need to run those games at 30fps on settings which don’t look like grey mud.",2a5edc31-8fe4-4901-9dcc-25b92eb52d01,Blog,2015-09-03T19:45:35Z,"Comments for Rock, Paper, Shotgun - PC Game Reviews, Previews, Subjectivity",Comment on Photorealism Is Crucial To Games by LexW1,1.0,Blog
1009,"MONTREAL , Sept. 29, 2015 /CNW Telbec/ - In the past week, Canada Steamship Lines bid farewell to two distinguished ladies - Birchglen and Mapleglen - as they set sail on their final journey. The two bulk carriers are en route to Turkey , where they will be responsibly recycled at an eco-friendly shipyard. 
The dismantling of the two mature vessels is part of CSL's fleet optimization and capacity management programs. Since 2012, the Great Lakes shipping company has introduced six new state-of-the-art Trillium Lakers and taken four older and less efficient ships out of service. 
   ""Great Lakes shipping is a mature market, it isn't growing,"" said 
, President of Canada Steamship Lines. ""Our Trillium program has always been about renewing our fleet, not growing it."" 
As new ships equipped with advanced technology continue to improve the operational and environmental performance of Great Lakes shipping, companies like CSL must adapt to maintain a fine balance between new tonnage and market demand. 
 "" CSL invested in the most efficient, safe, and environmentally-responsible ships for the future of Great Lakes shipping,"" noted Paterson. ""Now it is time to responsibly recycle some of the vessels that have defined our past."" 
The recycling of Birchglen and Mapleglen is scheduled to begin at a facility in Aliaga, Turkey , in mid-October, and will be conducted in full compliance with international rules and regulations, and with CSL's own rigorous ship recycling policy. 
 Birchglen was delivered from a Scottish shipyard in 1983 and began serving Canada Steamship Lines in 2002 when CSL bought the vessel from Fednav. The ship made history in July 2010 when she carried the largest cargo of windmill parts into the Great Lakes from Gros Cacouna, Quebec , to Burns Harbor, Indiana . Mapleglen was built in Hoboken, Belgium in 1981 and was purchased by CSL in October 2008 . She was a steady workhorse for the company until 2014. 
 Canada Steamship Lines is a division of The CSL Group, the world's largest owner and operator of self-unloading vessels. Headquartered in Montreal with divisions based in the United States , Europe , Asia and Australia , CSL delivers more than 76 million tonnes of cargo annually for customers in the construction, steel, energy and agricultural sectors.

882,"FRANKFURT, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Tenneco (NYSE:TEN) today unveiled its latest generation of electronically controlled valves at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show. The valves, which are designed to support low pressure exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) for diesel engines and acoustic tuning for gasoline engines, feature a unique new modular design which offers vehicle manufacturers custom flexibility and adaptability for any engine architecture.

Tenneco's latest generation electronic valves feature a unique new modular design, which offers vehicle manufacturers custom flexibility and adaptability for any engine architecture. (Photo: Business Wire) 

""We've seen a dramatic shift with our valve technology since its introduction just three years ago,"" said Tim Jackson, executive vice president and chief technology officer, Tenneco. ""Tenneco's latest generation valve has evolved to a modular, scalable design that is lightweight, can be easily packaged to fit within any engine architecture and offers on-demand customization, which provides significant cost and time savings for customers. Additionally, the valve can accommodate exhaust temperature specifications up to 750°C for EGR applications, which enables efficient NOx reduction - even with highly loaded engine conditions and high return flow rates."" Tenneco's latest generation valve features a dynamic flap control designed to generate optimal pressure conditions for efficient EGR and also provides fail-safe operation. The actuator is interchangeable using a simple mounting concept without any loose interface components and the valve's flexible actuator orientation allows for simple installation in any engine control environment, without the need to change parts. 

The valve delivers important acoustical benefits as well. Whether during engine start or while idling, the flap minimizes internal leakage, which helps to optimize sound quality. The electronically controlled variable flap remains closed during normal driving conditions for a quieter ride and opens during harder acceleration, creating lower backpressure, higher attenuation and more engine power for maximum efficiency. 

""Tenneco's new valve design serves as another important example of how our emissions technologies serve as enablers for improving fuel efficiency and helping customers meet important emissions regulations like EU6c, while maximizing engine performance,"" Jackson said. ""In the future, we'll continue to see valve technology evolve into hotter areas of the vehicle and we are already in development with valves that provide exhaust heat recovery solutions to address that need."" 

Tenneco is displaying these and other clean air and ride performance technologies at its exhibit during the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show, September 15-27, Hall 5.1, Stand A20. 

Tenneco is an $8.4 billion global manufacturing company with headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois and approximately 29,000 employees worldwide.Tenneco is one of the world's largest designers, manufacturers and marketers of clean air and ride performance products and systems for automotive and commercial vehicle original equipment markets and the aftermarket.Tenneco's principal brand names are Monroe®, Walker®, XNOx™ and Clevite®Elastomer.

Just days after Jennifer Aniston returned to work after her honeymoon , things are already getting steamy on set. 

The 46-year-old Golden Globe winner is currently in Atlanta, Georgia shooting her upcoming film Mother's Day, and on Monday she was spotted stepping outside, wrapped in nothing but a white terrycloth towel. 

WATCH: Jennifer Aniston Gets Back to Work in Atlanta Sporting Her Wedding Ring 

Aniston was also wearing a green trench coat, albeit inconspicuously -- maybe she just doesn't want to hang out on set half-naked, which would make sense. 

Aniston stars alongside Julia Roberts, Kate Hudson, Timothy Olyphant and her Horrible Bosses co-star Jason Sudeikis in the Garry Marshall-directed Mother's Day. 

A source recently told ET that Aniston brought along a dozen suitcases for her time in Atlanta, so it looks like she's planning a relatively lengthy stay in the Peach State.

Meanwhile Aniston's new husband Justin Theroux has headed back to work on the set of his HBO drama The Leftovers , which shoots in Austin, Texas, meaning the newlyweds might be spending some time apart. Hopefully they made the most of their luxurious Bora Bora honeymoon earlier this month.

6668,"Story highlights Japan's largest crime family has reportedly split into two rival factions The yakuza, Japan's answer to the mafia, are shrouded in secrecy but are influential across modern Japan Yakuza influence extends to politics, industry, construction and real estate 
The new group, which was formally created in early September , is calling themselves the Kobe Yamaguchi-gumi and is already setting up alliances with other organized crime groups. The National Police Agency says they have had an emergency meeting to discuss how to handle the crisis, and police nationwide are on alert.   

Tetsuya Shiroo, a local gang member affiliated with the Yamaguchi-gumi, shot and killed the mayor of Nagasaki in 2007. 

In the Japanese underworld, the 21 other organized crime groups are trying to decide which way the wind blows and who to align themselves with. The last split in the Yamaguchi-gumi, which began in 1984, resulted in several years of epic warfare marked with assassinations, attempted bombings and gun battles that terrified and enthralled the nation. 

Japan has very strict gun control laws, and in a land of 127 million people, there were six gun-related deaths last year, according to statistics by the National Police Agency. The possibility of the gang war reigniting frightens the general public considerably. 
Who are the yakuza?  
The yakuza is a blanket term for Japan's organized crime groups: The country's mafia. They were traditionally federations of gamblers and street merchants, but while the yakuza like to tout their history as going back hundreds of years, the oldest continuous group is, author Kazuhiko Murakami estimates, probably the Aizukotetsu-kai in Kyoto, founded in the 1870s. 

While many yakuza groups started as loosely run gambling associations, they really came into their own in the chaos after World War II, first running the black markets, providing gambling, and entertainment -- even managing some of Japan's top post-war stars and singers -- before moving into construction, real estate, and engaging in extortion, blackmail, and fraud. And then of course, politics.  

There are 21 major groups with more than 53,000 members, according to the National Police Agency. The three largest groups are the Yamaguchi-gumi (23,400), The Inagawa-kai, (6,600), and the Sumiyoshi-kai (8,500). The yakuza are not outlawed; they are regulated and monitored.  

Many of their money-making activities are illegal but they also run legitimate enterprises. The third-generation leader of the Yamaguchi-gumi, Kazuo Taoka, famously told his followers, ""Have a real job.""  They claim to be humanitarian groups that keep order in Japan. This is why they have office buildings, business cards, fan magazines, and comic books about their exploits.  

Yakuza members tend to be from those marginalized in Japan society traditionally -- the Korean-Japanese whose parents and grandparents were brought into Japan as slave laborers and members from the former outcast class of Japan, according to Mitsuhiro Suganuma, a former officer of the Public Security Intelligence Agency. 

The Yamaguchi-gumi began as a labor dispatch service on the docks of Kobe in 1915 -- 2015 marks its centenary -- and their corporate emblem is known by everyone.  
How much of the yakuza legend is true?  
When we speak of yakuza in the west, we tend to think of heavily-tattooed thugs and noble gangsters with missing pinkies.  

The older generation of yakuza did favor tattoos, but this has fallen out of favor as they were first used as identifiers by the authorities, and latterly have gained popularity with an expanding subset of Japanese. The traditional tattoo was extremely painful to have done and showed that the individual was tough, had turned his back on society, and that he had money to spend.  

The tattoos are also corporate branding at its finest -- some gang members have their organization emblem tattooed on their chest. It makes changing jobs or organizations difficult.  

Yakuza don't have their fingers chopped off as a punishment. There are two situations in which a yakuza chops off a digit, usually a pinkie. When he does it in lieu of payment of his own debts, or to atone for a mistake and stay in the organization or stay alive, this is called a ""dead finger."" If a yakuza sacrifices a finger for the sake of his subordinate or a friend, that's a ""living finger."" 

Prosthetics specialist Shintaro Hayashi, left, inspects the silicone finger of a former yakuza member in Tokyo. 

One former yakuza boss sometimes would refuse to accept a severed finger for a debt saying, ""I can't turn this into money. Bring me cash.""  

Younger members avoid carving up their bodies or chopping off their fingers as they bring unwanted attention.  
What do they control in Japan, and overseas?  
In Japan, the yakuza have some control over the entertainment industry -- many major talent agencies have yakuza ties and rule over their empires ruthlessly. The head of the National Police Agency on August 31, 2011 publicly stated: ""We will do what is necessary to aid the entertainment industry in cutting their ties to organized crime.""  

The Yamaguchi-gumi has even been linked to the funding of one of Japan's ubiquitous, super-cute teen girl bands. The band's management has not publicly commented on the claim, which has been reported in Japanese weekly magazines. 

They have a huge hand in the construction, real estate, currency exchange, labor dispatch, and the IT and financial industries, according to the National Police Agency. They also supply much of the labor for Japan's nuclear industry and have had influence in the neverending cleanup of the Fukushima disaster, according to Japanese and English media reports and books like Tomohiko Suzuki's ""Yakuza and The Nuclear Industry.""  

Yakuza members were,  according to Reuters , arrested in 2013 for infiltrating the construction giant tasked with the Fukushima cleanup and providing illegal workers. 

""We are taking it very seriously that these incidents keep happening one after another,"" said Junichi Ichikawa, a spokesman for Obayashi, adding that the company was examining its subcontracting firms to ensure that they were not linked to gang members. ""There were elements of what we had been doing that did not go far enough."" 

The Yamaguchi-gumi has been called Japan's second largest private equity group. Because they are gamblers and they are privy to, and willing to use, insider information, they see the stock market as a casino, where they are the house. The modern-day yakuza use their network of men and women working in Japan's ""hospitality"" industry -- escorts, ""hosts"" and ""hostesses,"" to collect information that can be used to judiciously blackmail company executives, politicians, and bureaucrats to maximize profits in their areas of interest.  

The U.S. Treasury Department  has labeled  the Yamaguchi-gumi a transcontinental organized crime group and even placed sanctions on the second tier group that rules them. 

""In order to conduct its criminal activities, the yakuza has relationships with criminal affiliates in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. In the United States, the yakuza has been involved in drug trafficking and money laundering,"" a statement from April reads.. 

""Including today's action, OFAC (the Office of Foreign Assets Control) has designated 13 senior yakuza members and five yakuza entities -- the Yamaguchi-gumi, Sumiyoshi-kai, Inagawa-kai, Kudo-kai, and Kodo-kai.  Today's designation of the Kodo-kai marks the first time a second-tier yakuza affiliate is being targeted."" 
How much influence do they wield?  
Even Japan's ruling party was not immune to the influence of the yakuza. The notorious yakuza Yoshio Kodama financed the Liberal Democratic Party in its early years, noted in ""Yakuza: Japan's Criminal Underworld"" by David E. Kaplan and Alec Dubro.  

The Minister of Education in Japan  is alleged to have received political donations from a yakuza front company. After denying receiving donations, he later admitted to getting a 180,000 yen ($1500) donation that he has since returned. He denies any other wrongdoing. 

Another Abe cabinet member, Eriko Yamatani, who heads the Public Safety Commission, which oversees the National Police Agency, is ""suspected of consorting"" with a racist right wing group that has ties to the yakuza. After posing in a 2009 photograph with members of the Zaitokukai, the group in question, the government said she didn't know that the people in the photograph were connected to the group. 

Eriko Yamatani denied ties to a right-wing group known for its hate speech. 

Asked about it at a Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan speech, Yamatani would not comment on what she thought of the organization's views. 

The Vice Chairman of Japan's Olympic Committee has also been photographed  with a top member of the Sumiyoshi-kai. The official, Hidetoshi Tanaka, claimed the photographs of him with the head of the Yamaguchi-gumi which were published last year are fake.  

In the business world, they are a last resort in crushing labor unions, scandals and finding labor for jobs that no one wants to do.  
What does this latest Yakuza activity mean for Japan?  
The Yamaguchi-gumi split into two groups at the end of August could spark gang wars in Japan. 

The Yamaguchi-gumi had 72 factions before the split. The other 21 organized crime groups in Japan will have to decide which group to support: the old guard or the rebels. That may cause groups such as the Inagawa-kai, the third largest group, to split apart as their own factions decide loyalty.  

The Sumiyoshi-kai, Japan's second largest crime group, may already be splitting apart in response to the Yamaguchi-gumi conflict.  According to police sources, the powerful Kohei-Ikka faction has expressed solidarity with the ""Kobe Yamaguchi-gumi"" and may split apart from the Sumiyoshikai to join them.  

The one thing that should keep casualties low is that under civil law, yakuza bosses can be sued for damages committed by their underlings. In 2012, Goto Tadamasa, a former crime boss,  paid $1.4 million  to the family of a real estate agent that his men had killed. He was never convicted in a criminal court.

In the modern-day yakuza, money is worth more than blood. That's why the rebel faction of the Yamaguchi-gumi may win simply by offering reduced association dues to those who join them.",63ae052d-5e24-4406-a334-b8dc811d8f3f,News,2015-09-17T01:01:09Z,CNN,Could yakuza split lead to war?,0.0,Blog

At the United Nations General Assembly in New York taking place from 25-27 September, world leaders endorsed new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), an ambitious agenda that aims to end poverty, promote prosperity and to protect the environment. 

Leaders of the MDBs - the African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, European Investment Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, World Bank Group - and the IMF described the agreement as an historic landmark. The well-being of our planet and its people are at the heart of the new goals. 

They point the way towards greater prosperity and equality and will ensure more robust and sustainable economic growth, the leaders said. 

In July this year, at a Financing for Development conference in Addis Ababa, the institutions unveiled plans to scale up their finance and support for countries seeking to achieve the development goals, pledging to increase their financial contribution to more than $400 billion over the next three years. 

They vowed to examine how they could increase their own financing and also to work to ensure a greater mobilization of domestic resources and expanded funding from the private sector.",7c2b336c-7dfe-404a-8997-6b0efe8f18d4,News,2015-09-26T05:39:32Z,Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha,MDBs back new global development agenda,0.0,News

Chapter 83: Reflex Point 
 
This is exciting! Reflex Point! The whole story has been heading towards this point for so long! My expectations are very high. 
 
The Regis muses on irony, and how protoculture allows the Invid to change into any form they like, but their extensive research has concluded that HUMANS, HUMANS ARE THE BEST DESIGN. 
 
“We are Invid, we cannot fail, I will not allow it.” 
 
 

 
A group of troublemakers, AKA our heroes, are startled by an explosion nearby. Hoping it might be that spunky Rick Hunter, they head towards it only to find some damaged mecha in a smoking crater. 
 
Scott carefully surveys the damaged mecha and pronounces that there are no survivors. 
 
“Nobody said war was pretty.” The narrator, setting the tone as always. 
 
Proving that Scott is an idiot, a survivor promptly turns up – an intelligence agent called Sue Graham, who looks a lot like Marie Crystal but isn’t. Her assignment is to record the mission for Admiral Hunter and send him information. 
 
Scott is furious to find out that Sue filmed the deaths of her colleagues instead of joining in the battle and getting killed alongside them. He and Lancer get aggressive and judgy at her. 
 
Hundreds of Invid are approaching. Sue tells them all to deactivate their protoculture cells and abandon the mecha so the Invid think everyone is dead, but they are so busy not trusting her that they leave it to the last minute and only just make it into the woods. 
 
Their Cyclones have a near miss, but the jeep and the Beta are both knocked into a ravine by the stompy Invid. Aww, ships, no. (Don’t worry, they’re fine later) 
 
Sue has some good news, at least: there is a force of Admiral Hunter’s fleet, called shadow fighters, hanging around the dark side of the moon, ready to launch an assault against the Invid when “the time is right”. Scott repeatedly challenges her about doing her job (passing information to the local fighters to give them hope, and collecting data to send back to the fleet) rather than going rogue freedom fighter like him, which is the Only Correct Moral Choice. 
 
Scott needs to not be in charge any more. 
 
#TeamSue 
 
The crew all have adorable space sleeping bags that make them look like caterpillars. Scott is angsting about Marlene Mark I, and Marlene Mark II suggests that he’s never going to be over her. She has a good point considering that he NAMED HER AFTER HIS DEAD GIRLFRIEND. 
 
Scott and the crew are reluctantly going on a mission to collect a magic special space cannon that Sue told them about. Scott suspects that Sue has set them up so she can get some amazing footage of them getting “creamed” by the Invid. 
 
I’m confused by their lack of distinction between a spy collecting necessary war intelligence, and a paparazzo-style media bunny. Mind you, Sue doesn’t help the situation by saying things like “Admiral Hunter’s going to love this footage” which implies she is creating entertainment for the poor bored Admiral instead of, you know, helping the war effort. 
 
On the other hand, maybe Rick is just super bored. It’s not easy at the top. 
 
Even the narrator complains that Sue is shooting nothing but film footage, when the Invid attack. Annie isn’t shooting anyone either! Because it’s NOT HER JOB OR HER SKILLSET. 
 
I can’t help noticing that this episode called Reflex Point does not seem to actually have anything to do with Reflex Point. Surely they’ll get there soon, right? Right? 
 
The leader of this particular Invid battalion is a glam rock style blond who bleeds green when he is killed. Sue is delighted to have proof that the Invid are turning themselves into humans – but Marlene is less than delighted, because she is bleeding green from a scratch on her arm. 
 
YOU GUYS I THINK MARLENE IS AN INVID! 
 
Marlene flees in horror, and Scott is surprisingly calm and forgiving about the whole thing, thinking more about how upset she must be than worrying about whether she was spying on them. It’s his one moment of being pretty awesome in an episode that is mostly all about him being a dick. 
 
Sue drops dead from, I don’t know, irony, I guess, and Scott gives a grave speech about how she was the most dedicated professional he ever met in the REF, which goes to show that even when he’s being nice, he’s also a massive hypocrite. 
 
As the episode closes without any sign of Reflex Point, the narrator works harder to get up our hopes that Admiral Hunter will be turning up any minute. 
 
I… don’t think he can be trusted… 
 
But they wouldn’t keep mentioning Admiral Hunter this much if he wasn’t going to turn up in the final episode, right? RIGHT?

1047,"A young German man was rescued by emergency services from the isolated cove Cala Llebeig, known locally as the fishermen’s cove, located on the rugged coast of the Poble Nou de Benitatxell, Alicante. He had to be evacuated by sea after the helicopter rescue team were unable to help the 28 year old victim. 

The exhausted adventurer had made the journey along a coastal cliff top path that runs in between the Cala Moraig beach of Cumbre del Sol and the hidden cove of Cala Llebeig, a stretch of approximately two kilometers of rough terrain. A route used historically by fishermen, the trail descends down into the small cove which is where friends of the victim started to worry for the health of the man. Fearing he may suffer from respiratory failure, since he showed signs of extreme exhaustion and was unable to make the journey back, they called emergency services 112. The man is said to have been of large build and weighing over 150 kilos. 

The tiny cove is inaccessible by road so the only options were for air or sea rescue.

6420,"The Nigeria Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs NSCIA has overruled the Jamaátu Nasril Islam the umbrella body for Islamic organisations in Nigeria on the declaration of Wednesday September 23 as Eid-el-Kabir day in Nigeria

The JNI had in a statement on Sunday by its Secretary General Khalid Aliyu said the month of Dhul Hajj begins today Monday meaning Eid-el-Kabir would be observed on Wednesday September 23

The JNI like the NSCIA is under the leadership of the Sultan of Sokoto Saád Abubakar

When PREMIUM TIMES contacted the Secretary General of the NSCIA Ishaq Oloyede on Monday he said the announcement by the JNI was done in error

“The NSCIA would issue a statement on the new month of Dhul hajj later today”he said

He also said the Moon-Sighting committee of the NSCIA already agreed with the decision of authorities in Saudi Arabia that the month of Dhul Hajj begins tomorrow Tuesday

“Consequently Eid-El-Kabir would be observed on Thursday September 24 while Wednesday is Arafat day” he said

Sunday’s statement by the JNI quoted the Sultan as ‘felicitating’ with Nigerian Muslims “over the successful commencement of Dhul-Hajj today Monday 14th September 2015 This is indeed gratifying as Wednesday 23rd September 2015 will mark this year’s Eid-el-Kabir In-Shaa-Allah”

Not new to controversy

This is not the first time Islamic leaders in Nigeria are locked in controversy over moon-sighting or Eid day declaration

There was similar confusion last year over whether the new moon of Shawwal signifying the end of Ramadan fast was sighted in Nigeria

The Sultan himself who is the President of the NSCIA had around midnight on a Saturday announced the sighting of the new moon and therefore the end of Ramadan

”The new month of Shawwal was sighted in different places within Nigeria and therefore tomorrow Sunday is the first day of Shawwal equivalent to 27 July 2014” the Sultan said in an announcement aired on the Nigerian Television Authority NTA

But when contacted after the Sultan’s announcement Mr Oloyede a professor of Islamic Studies said he was not aware that the moon had been sighted

“I spoke to the Sultan about four times tonight and he did not tell me that the moon has been sighted” Mr Oloyede told PREMIUM TIMES at the time “In any case any such claim is ridiculous and unscientific It cannot be right

“The National Moon-Sighting Committee has not informed us of any credible sighting of the moon Rather they said the moon wasn’t sighted The new moon was only born at 1145 PM tonight Saturday and it will take several hours for it to be sighted

4584,"The 62-year-old suspect in the 1985 slaying of Kristina Wesselman was ordered held without bail this morning. 
 
Michael R. Jones faces two counts of murder and one count of aggravated criminal sexual assault stemming from the July 21, 1985 killing of 15-year-old Kristina, who lived near Glen Ellyn. 
 
Jones appeared in court in a yellow prison jumpsuit amid extreme courthouse security; nine sheriff's deputies were present in the courtroom. 
 
The 15-year-old sophomore at Glenbard South High School was attacked in broad daylight about 4 p.m. on a path that was a popular shortcut for children to get to a Jewel store at Butterfield Road and Route 53 from their Valley View subdivision. Her body, nude from the waist down, was found in a pile of leaves by a sheriff's deputy about 11 a.m. the following day. She had been stabbed eight time and sexually assaulted, authorities said. 
 
Authorities say Jones, of Champaign, was linked to the crime through a DNA sample he was required to give after pleading guilty to a sexual assault in downstate Champaign County. His DNA matched samples on file in a state database. 
 
Jones was on parole at the time Kristina was murdered. He had served seven years of a 10- to 20-year term for an August, 1977 Schiller Park sexual assault. In that case, authorities said he ran his car into a 27-year-old bicyclist, knocking her to the ground. He then forced her into the car, bound her wrists and put a wool stocking cap over her head. He then drove to a family member's home in Schiller Park, and assaulted her there. 
 
DuPage County Judge Daniel Guerin denied Jones' bail this morning. He is scheduled to be arraigned Oct. 13 before Judge John Kinsella. 
 
The 30-year-old cold case broke Sept. 10, when the DNA match came to light. A search warrant was conducted at his Champaign address on Friday, police said, and Jones was arrested Sunday. 
 
Champaign County court records indicate Jones was required to give blood, saliva or tissue samples and ordered to pay a fee for DNA analysis after he pleaded guilty July 2 to a felony domestic battery charge. Four years ago, in an effort to reinvigorate their investigation, authorities for the first time disclosed that they believed Kristina's killer removed a pearl ring from her body after the slaying.",07028e47-48ad-4363-b1dd-78ff8d064ae9,News,2015-09-21T13:20:42Z,Chicago Daily Herald,No bail for 1985 Glen Ellyn murder suspect,0.0,News

4445,"Scott Walker and Energy 
 
Scott Walker isn’t open for business when it comes to solar and wind power. 
 
“As far as wind and solar developers are concerned, the Wisconsin governor may be the worst man for the job,” a recent story in Bloomberg.com notes. “Five years after Walker took office, renewable energy in Wisconsin is lagging the boom in the rest of the country and industry blames the two-term governor for the shortfall.” 
 
Among six midwestern states, Indiana has increased the use of solar power the most, adding more than 115 megawatts in the last five years, compared to about 20 megawatts for last place Wisconsin, the story reports. In wind power for the period 2011 to 2014, top state Iowa added more than 5,500 megawatts, compared to little or no growth for Wisconsin. 
 
The upper Midwest has been a boom area for wind power except in Wisconsin. As I reported in January of last year, “in 2012 seven percent of the entire world market of wind energy was developed in America’s upper Midwest, but 99.4 percent of this development occurred outside Wisconsin.” 
 
  “Walker and his appointees have pushed new restrictions on windmills, cut tax incentives and research funding and last year imposed the nation’s highest fees on rooftop solar owners,” Bloomberg reporter Alex Nusbaum notes. 
 
The Alliance for Solar Choice is suing Wisconsin over the new fees, which its spokesperson Amy Heart blames for “the worst” environment in the nation for home solar owners, while increasing revenue for public utilities in Wisconsin. 
 
Heart told Bloomberg that Republican primary voters “won’t support Governor Walker,” because he’s “a politician who supports state-sponsored monopolies who are killing competition.” 
 
While utilities nationally have made the argument that home solar users should pay something to help maintain the electric grid they also depend on, the $30 monthly fee for the typical solar customer of Milwaukee-based We Energies Corp.  makes Wisconsin “an outlier” on solar energy nationally, as Ben Inskeep , an analyst at North Carolina State University’s Clean Energy Technology Center, told Bloomberg. “Among all the cases we’ve seen in the country, this is probably one of the top ones in terms of reducing the value proposition for residential customers.” 
 
Laurel Patrick , the governor’s spokeswoman, didn’t respond to questions from Bloomberg about the new solar fee or wind-siting rules that have helped retard wind power growth in Wisconsin and instead pointed to other “alternative energy” measures: “The administration has backed tax breaks and loans for biodigesters that create power from farm waste as well as small-scale generators that let diesel trucks reduce idling.” 
 
Wisconsin’s potential to become a wind and solar power state is considerable. Wisconsin ranks 17th highest in wind power potential, according to the American Wind Energy Association, with enough wind power to produce four times more total energy than the state’s current electrical needs. 
 
And this area compares favorably to Germany, which now gets more than 50 percent of its electricity through solar power, in the amount of solar radiation it receives. 
 
But instead of doing all he can to develop the state’s solar and wind power industries, Walker has done his best to keep the state a net energy importer; Wisconsin spends an estimated $12 billion annually to purchase coal and gas and other fossil fuels from other states. 
 
“Critics look at Walker’s record and see the ideological imprint of Charles and David Koch , the billionaire Republican campaign donors,” Nusbaum writers. “The Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity provided funding and volunteers during Walker’s rise to power in Wisconsin.” 
 
In fact, David Koch has  made it clear that Walker is one of his favorite candidates running in Republican presidential primary.",829b3d0a-e894-4b43-b052-3ccd278d35d2,Blog,2015-09-09T16:16:07Z,Urban Milwaukee,"Back in the News: Walker “Worst” Candidate on Wind, Solar?",1.0,News

3215,"Mumbai : In line with equity market, the rupee on Tuesday ended nine paise higher at 65.96 against dollar on persistent selling of the US currency by banks and exporters amid sustained capital inflows. 
Weakness of dollar in the overseas market also affected market sentiment. 

The rupee resumed sharply lower at 66.33 per dollar against Monday's close of 66.05 at the interbank foreign exchange market and dropped further to 66.41 on initial month-end dollar demand from importers. 

However, it recovered afterwards to 65.92 due to rise in equity market before finishing at 65.96 per dollar, showing a gain of 0.09 paise or 0.14 per cent. 

The rupee has gained by 20 paise or 0.30 per cent in two days. 

The US dollar weakened against the yen on Tuesday as investors moved into haven assets amid a sell-off in stocks and industrial commodities like oil and copper. The dollar also lost ground to the euro after official data showed pending US home sales fell to a five-month low in August. 

The dollar index was trading lower by 0.03 per cent against a basket of six currencies. 

Meanwhile, the Sensex failed to maintain mid-session gains on the back of lower global cues despite a steeper-than-expected rate cut by the RBI by 0.50 per cent after its fourth bi-monthly monetary policy review for 2015-16. 

The Sensex ended 161.82 points or 0.63 per cent higher. 

The benchmark six-month premium payable in February fell further to 175-177 paise from the last weekend's level of 179-181 paise and for forward August 2016 also moved down further to 386.5-388.5 paise from 394-396 paise. 

The Reserve Bank of India fixed the reference rate for the dollar at 66.1843 and for the euro at 74.6096.

981,"The popular comedy drama about Nina Proudman and her family will be back on air next year. 

Offspring will be back on air in 2016.

For more than a year since the last episode of Ten's popular dramedy went to air, fans have been expecting to hear that a new series in the adventures of obstetrician Nina Proudman (Asher Keddie) and her family was on its way.

Now, Ten has finally delivered.

Announcing the news, programming chief Beverley McGarvey said: ""It was no secret that we wanted to continue Nina's adventures and we are thrilled to announce that Offspring will return to Ten for a sixth season in 2016"".

""There are so many more chapters left in Nina's life,"" she said.

""We paused her story just as she had bravely navigated motherhood as a single parent rediscovering the joy and romance of life, while dealing with her fabulously messy family as they went about their unpredictable daily lives.

""The strength and appeal of Offspring lies in the ability of its producers and writers to marry conventional narrative drama with flashbacks and fantasy sequences. We can't wait to start production on the sixth season.""

It's not just fans who will welcome the arrival of this healthy addition to the line-up; Ten desperately needs a home-grown drama for its schedule.

Over five seasons from 2010, Offspring has been a reliable ratings performer for the network, at times its one shining light amid a downturn that seemed destined never to end.

Its final season-five episode on August 9, 2014 was Ten's highest performer of the week, being watched by a tick under 1.5 million viewers nationally (cities and regions).

But the show's success was also its curse: because more than 65 episodes had been produced, it no longer qualified for the producer offset, a federal government program that allows a tax rebate of 20 per cent of production costs.

That meant the show, which is produced by Endemol Shine, would be considerably more expensive for Ten to acquire.

Last year, producer John Edwards noted, ""The show is now so popular that paying a higher price for it is obviously a consideration"".

Ten has clearly decided it is a price worth paying, and fans can be thankful for that. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.",17176aff-4659-4193-adb0-525f95867da4,News,2015-09-20T00:35:14Z,Moree Champion,Offspring to return to Ten in 2016,0.0,News

MADISON, Wis. -- The first thing Tyler Marz remembers about his freshman season at Wisconsin in 2011 was the sheer dominance of the Badgers' offensive line. Hulking. Skillful. Mauling.
That team, which reached the second of three straight Rose Bowls, featured four starters on the line who became NFL draft picks: Rick Wagner, Travis Frederick, Pete Konz and Kevin Zeitler. The other player, Josh Oglesby, was a consensus first-team All-Big Ten selection whose pro dream was cut short only because of knee injuries.
""Shoot, when I first got here, there were NFL guys on the second team,"" said Marz, the Badgers' fifth-year starting left tackle. ""The second team probably could have started on many other teams in the country. Obviously, we're not in that situation right now.""
Indeed, as Marz's college career comes full circle, the contrast in offensive line capacity could not be starker. What once was considered a unit as feared as any in the nation has floated back down to earth due, in part, to bad luck and bad timing. Never was that more evident than Saturday, when Wisconsin ran the ball 21 times for a total of 40 yards -- an average of just 1.9 yards per carry -- in its season-opening loss against No. 3 Alabama.Corey Clement and Wisconsin found running the ball to be difficult against Alabama last Saturday. AP Photo/LM Otero
Only one run went for more than five yards the entire game -- a 25-yarder outside the tackles on a fourth-quarter end-around by receiver Alex Erickson. The 40 rushing yards represented Wisconsin's fewest in a game since finishing with 19 against Michigan State in 2012.
""As an offensive line, we're not happy with how we performed,"" Wisconsin center Dan Voltz said. ""We didn't do our jobs up front as well as we should've. Didn't play physical enough. Didn't fit up our blocks. Didn't sustain. Those are things we've been working on.""
Perhaps it may not be fair to place blame solely on the line. Badgers tailback Corey Clement aggravated a groin injury, barely played in the second half and gained just 16 yards on eight carries. His backups, Taiwan Deal and Dare Ogunbowale, were hardly familiar with the spotlight and combined for 23 yards on nine carries. Factor in Alabama's menacing front seven, and it was simply a combination that proved far too much to overcome.
Still, Marz said the performance was unacceptable for a unit tasked with upholding a tradition as rich as the one Wisconsin has had over the years.
""It shouldn’t matter who's back there at running back,"" Marz said. ""If there's not a hole, there's not a hole. Watching the film, the running game was because of us.""
The reality of Wisconsin's plight is this: Outside of Marz and Voltz, the Badgers did not have a single offensive lineman that had ever started a college game before Saturday. Wisconsin started redshirt freshman Michael Deiter at left guard, redshirt junior Walker Williams at right guard and redshirt sophomore Hayden Biegel at right tackle. Before the Alabama game, the three had combined to play in six games, all belonging to Williams. Compare that to the seniors they replaced off last year's team -- left guard Dallas Lewallen, right guard Kyle Costigan and right tackle Rob Havenstein -- who left having combined to play in 123 games with 97 starts.
""It's different,"" Voltz said. ""Last year, we had five guys that knew each other really well.""
What has happened to Wisconsin's once vaunted line? Start with coaching turnover when six assistants left after the 2011 season, which contributed to four-star recruits Kyle Dodson and J.J. Denman flipping their Wisconsin commitments. Dodson chose to be a part of Urban Meyer's first recruiting class at Ohio State before injuries forced him to quit. Denman is a fourth-year junior at Rutgers and the Scarlet Knights' starting right tackle. Recruits Matt Miller, Jack Keeler and Trent Denlinger all stopped playing because of head injuries. And Jaden Gault, one of the top recruits in the 2014 class, left the team because of depression issues and has not returned.
This fall, a series of minor injuries meant limited reps for the line to build continuity. Three linemen didn't even make the trip for the Alabama game, including senior Ray Ball, who has appeared in 31 career games but remains out with an arm injury.
Marz added that coaching changes contributed to the line's woes as a whole. Since Marz has been in the program, he has learned from three different head coaches and five offensive line coaches, one of whom, Mike Markuson, was fired after only two games in 2012.
""When each year you've got to learn a new playbook, sometimes it's hard for certain guys,"" Marz said. ""It's kind of hard to keep building on that. Maybe some guys aren't developing as quickly or as well as they could have had we been in a stable program.""
Circumstances certainly haven't favored Wisconsin, which now has one of its least experienced offensive lines in years. But with minimal time to make significant fixes in season, the Badgers have little choice but to keep pushing.
""It's not like we're the only team in the country that has three guys that have never played before,"" Voltz said. ""That's how football is. It's next man up, and you've got to play well.""",1ef2f9a8-5479-432b-931c-7c70a34bb4d1,Blog,2015-09-09T09:00:03Z,ESPN Feed: - blog,"MADISON, Wis. -- The first thing Tyler Marz remembers about his freshman season at Wisconsin in 2011 was the sheer dominance of the Badgers' offensive line.

4889,"The $13 million deal is expected to close…  
Feed Loader GLEN STUBBE ï gstubbe@startribune.com -- Tuesday , June 16, 2009 -- Minneapolis, Minn. -- ] Irwin Jacobs, chairman of VEC Technology. He intends to open a factory that will produce fiberglass blades for wind farms. Jacobs said the blades that he will manufacture will be made with a closed mold process so the blades will be stronger and more durable than current blades on the market. 

Talk about a classic case of sell high and buy low. 

Well-known Twin Cities business man Irwin Jacobs has agreed to buy back Jacobs Trading from Liquidity Services Inc. for at least $13 million, just four years after Liquidity paid Jacobs over $140 million for the business. 

Liquidity Services, a Washington, D.C.-based surplus goods dealer, announced the sale Friday, and it’s expected to close Wednesday. 

Jacobs Trading, which sells closeout merchandise, is the original business that Irwin Jacobs and his father started decades ago. He sold it to publicly traded Liquidity Services for $140 million in cash, though Jacobs said the proceeds eventually totaled about $200 million. 

That amount includes payments Jacobs received after Jacobs Trading met some post-deal financial goals, as well as profits from Liquidity Services stock that Jacobs obtained in the transaction. 

Liquidity Services could stand to get $4 million in proceeds beyond the $13 million price tag if the Jacobs-owned Jacobs Trading meets certain financial goals in the next few years. 

“We will grow the company again, I’m certain of that,” Jacobs told the Star Tribune. “I believe we can turn it around quickly. 

” 

Jacobs Trading historically had a vital relationship with Wal-Mart, reselling goods that had been returned, were damaged or were obsolete. Liquidity Services, which already had a relationship with Wal-Mart, bought …",50e37081-a7e3-4657-8e6c-ca5a9e182d4b,News,2015-09-25T23:14:34Z,MyInforms,Irwin Jacobs buys back company from Liquidity Services,0.0,News

4647,"The Surgeon General of the United States is asking for 22 minutes of your time every day.

Vivek Murthy’s national “Call to Action” is a nationwide initiative urging people of all ages to walk for a minimum of 150 minutes a week – the amount of physical activity shown to reduce the effects of chronic disease, support mental health and reduce the risk of premature death.

While 22 minutes of walking might not seem like much, the Department of Health and Human Services reports that fewer than half the country’s adults currently get enough exercise, and that among high school students, the number drops to about 25 percent.

Some neighborhoods are unsafe, lack sidewalks or can’t accommodate wheelchairs users, who are also targeted by Murthy’s initiative. The ‘Call to Action’ addresses those concerns by partnering with educators, cities and the private sector to make neighborhoods more walkable.

Surgeon General Vivek Murthy discusses his “call to action” with Here & Now’s Megna Chakrabarti.

I would die for you
Lay down my life for you
The only thing that means everything to me
'Cause when you're in my arms
You make me prouder than
Than anything I ever could achieve
And you make everything that used to seem so big
Seem to be so small since you arrived
On angel's wings, an angelical formation
Angel's wings, like letters in the sky
Now I know no matter what the question
Love is the answer
It's written on angel's wings
And I often wonder why,
Someone as flawed as I
Deserves to be as happy as you make me
So as the years roll by
I'll be there by your side
I'll follow you wherever your heart takes me
Cause you make everything that used to be so big
Seem to be so small since you arrived
On angel's wings, an angelical formation
Angel's wings, like letters in the sky
Now I know no matter what the question
Love is the answer
It's written on angel's wings
Now anyone who's felt the touch of heaven in their lives
Will know the way I'm feeling, looking
In my baby's eyes
That's why I can't bear to be too far away
I know that god must love me cause
He sent you to me on angel's wings
On angel's wings, an angelical formation
Angel's wings, like letters in the sky
Now I know no matter what the question
Love is the answer
It's written on angel's wings
Love is the answer
It's written on angel's wings

4884,"Yes, virtual reality technology will turn us all into drooling idiots and destroy civilization — but it won’t be the first. Here are ten other technologies that have already destroyed civilization. 10. The Internet (Image courtesy Ministerio TIC Colombia via Flickr.) The Internet is more addictive than cocaine. Back in 1995, fewer than 15 percent of Americans used the Internet, and those who did, spent less than 30 minutes a month online. Today, 87 percent of us are online, and spend an average of 11 hours a day staring at a screen. Eleven hours! That can’t be right! I don’t know about you, but I’m never away from the Internet. If I’m not sitting at my computer — and also when I am — my smartphone is always within reach. Any dumb question that comes into my head — a quick “Hey, Siri” or “OK, Google” and I’ve got the answer. If someone pings me or pokes me or Skypes me or texts me or emails me, my phone will let me know. It’s the last thing I look at at night, and the first thing I check in the morning. It’s my radio station and my alarm clock. Eleven hours. More like 24 hours! Now, you might have heard about that McKinsey report that shows that the Internet adds more than 3 percent to GDP, that 75 percent of the benefits go to non-tech companies, and that 2.6 jobs are created for every job lost to technological progress. They call the Internet a “vast mosaic of economic activity.” Hah! Those of us who have ever been on the Internet know the truth: it is a vast wasteland of cat videos, porn, and Kardashian gossip. It rots minds, corrupts youth, promotes alternative lifestyles and gay marriage, and destroys our health. I myself have gained several pounds over the past twenty years, and the Internet is totally at fault. Also, the Kardashians. Without the Internet, would any of us have heard about that sex tape? The Internet has clearly destroyed civilization — and continues to destroy it. 9. Television (Image courtesy Paul Townsend via Flickr.) The original “vast wasteland,” television has been turning us into drooling idiots for more than fifty years. With shows like “Gilligan’s Island,” “Three’s Company” and “Keeping up with the Kardashians,” television has rotted our brains, destroyed our ability to communicate with other humans in any meaningful fashion, and eroded both our imaginations and our muscle tone. Television has destroyed the movie industry. Other than the record-breaking audiences who have been going out to the theaters in recent years, who really goes to the movies these days? After all, you can watch it on television for free? Television has destroyed radio. Why listen to something when you can see it, too? And books and newspapers — reading is just too hard when you can get your information pre-chewed and hand-fed to you. It destroyed friendships. After all, who are better friends — your actual friends, or “Friends”? It destroys families. Watching family life on television is much more compelling than having your own. Even sex pales in comparison. Is it any wonder that birth rates drop in every country that gets televisions? It’s a miracle that any humans are left on the planet at all. 8. Telephones (Image courtesy Seattle Municipal Archives via Flickr.) There used to be a time when talking to another human being meant that you would go out and meet them, face to face. Then every teenager got his or her own line, and hide in their rooms all night, talking to their friends. Both at work and at home, if we need to reach someone, we pick up the phone, instead of going outside and actually finding them. Telephone addiction is a real thing. And it requires a growing army of telephone operators. Pretty soon, we’ll all be working on telephone switchboards. Telephones contribute to inactivity and social isolation. They bring us fake psychics and phone sex lines and telemarketers. And speaking of telemarketers — think of how much easier it is to hang up on a sales call and it is to get rid of a door-to-door salesmen. Telephones have not only destroyed our society, but our economy, as well. 7. Electricity (Image courtesy Micolo J via Flickr.) Electricity kills. Literally, it can kill you. It is a gateway technology for radios, telephones, televisions and the Internet. It makes us lazy and stupid. By making refrigeration easy and convenient it has helped allow the movement of food across vast distances. Instead of eating locally grown, in-seasons food we can now eat a variety of fruits and vegetables from all sorts of exotic locations, and stretches of bad weather no longer cause widespread famines. And without a good famine once in a while, the human race has become weak. And when’s the last time you heard about someone dying from scurvy, polio, mumps, smallpox or the Black Plague? It used to be that a scratch could get infected and kill you. Before modern medicine, people had to be tough to survive. But as a result of electricity, we can keep our vaccines refrigerated, can keep hospitals lit at all hours of day and night, can light up the sirens on the roofs of ambulances. Our doctors get to use all kind of fancy medical equipment that is powered by electricity, or manufactured with the help of electricity. Electricity lights our homes and our cities, allowing us to work longer hours and stay up later. And, worst of all, it has led to the explosion of white-collar jobs. These are not real jobs for real men and real women. Jobs where you make something or grow something. With white collar jobs, you’re creating and managing information instead of things. It used to be that you could put a kid to work as soon as they could walk. Now, they’ve got to go to college — or, at least, finish high school. Real humans make things. We don’t push paper around. Every year we’re moving further and further away from the core of what it is to be a human being. And electricity is helping power that devolution. 6. Cars (Image courtesy Pedro Ribeiro Simões via Flickr.) Also moving us away? Cars. It used to be that going somewhere required that you walked, or hitched up your wagon to your horse. You were connected to your own body, to weather, to nature. Now, you get in your car and just drive there. When was the last time you were trapped by a storm and had to eat your companions to survive? And cars destroy social ties. Back when it took days, weeks, or months to visit your relatives, you didn’t just drop in for a few minutes. You came and you stayed. You really got to connect with people on a very deep level. 5. Steam power (Image courtesy Barry Lewis via Flickr.) Speaking of each travel, trains also destroyed civilization. And the industrial revolution permanently changed who we were. Before, almost all of us worked as farmers, growing the food we needed to survive. If we needed something, we made it ourselves, or turned to one of the few craftsmen around to make it for us. Physical objects were rare, and valuable. Clothing, furniture, decorations and accessories were all painstakingly hand made. They were treasures, passed down from generation to generation. The industrial revolution, by allowing for the mass production of everything from farm implements to clothing may have improved our standard of living — but at the cost of our civilization. We left the farms and started working grubby, dangerous, unnatural factory jobs. Subsistence farms turned into professionally-run agribusinesses. We weren’t dying of hunger as often as before, but the cost was too high. We lost our humanity. 4. Books (Image courtesy Becca Swift via Flickr.) Humans invented the first kind of virtual reality — literature — thousands of years ago. And it has been rotting our brains ever since. Instead of listening to each other, and passing stories along in an oral tradition the way we’re supposed to, we started writing them down. We no longer had to have personal relationships with experts and mentors. We could just read their books. We no longer had to travel and meet with people face-to-face. We could just send them letters. We no longer had to memorize the information we needed to survive. We could just look it up. In fact, we no longer even had to remember the things that happened to us and the people we met. We could write things down in diaries, instead. The invention of writing was the worst thing that could have happened to our brains, to our social connections, to our civilization. But there’s more. Books allowed us to travel to new and imaginary worlds that were infinitely better than our own. Worlds with heroes and knights and romance, where good always triumphed and everyone lived happily ever after. Given the choice, who wouldn’t want to live inside books? People turned into bookworms, and cut themselves off from society. Others went insane due to their inability to tell reality from fiction, as in the tragic case of Don Quihote, who started to believe that knights and dragons were real and went off to joust with windmills. Even to this day, you can find books everywhere. Global literacy is at an all-time high and fantasy authors can become billionaires by creating imaginary worlds. And almost every supermarket checkout offers spy and romance novels, newspapers, and magazines featuring the Kardashians. 3. Cave paintings (Image courtesy Wikimedia Commons.) It used to be that if I found a particularly good hunting ground, or did something particularly heroic, I would tell my fellow tribesmen all about it around our campfire. But then they had to go and invent cave paintings, and now our teenagers, instead of paying attention to their elders, just sit around in the cave all day staring at the paintings. And it would be bad enough if the painters stopped at geography lessons and hunting stories, pleas to Gods, and territorial markings. But no, they also paint sexy women. Who wants to bother with real females when they can see the curviest curves on their walls? Cave paintings destroyed our civilization. And we still have drawings on our walls to this day, a sign that you just can’t keep a good civilization-destroying technology down. Also — posters of the Kardashians. They pop up everywhere. 2. Fire (Image courtesy Matthew Peoples via Flickr.) Back in the old days, we chewed our food, like real people. Enough said. 1. Language (Image courtesy Wikimedia Commons.) According to some scientists, we evolved larger brains in order to have nuanced language. Language that did more than allow us to give directions or warn our fellows about threats. Most animals can do that much. No, we needed complex language in order to describe complex social connections and emotional ties, to enforce social mores, to help group cohesion, and to improve our chances of survival. Gossip. They’re talking about gossip. Any one of us who has ever used language to communicate immediately knows that this just isn’t true. Gossip destroys civilization. Real men grunt and point. Politicians and busy bodies chatter away. Before language, we could only communicate about things that actually were there. Physical things. Things we could point to or imitate. Language allowed us to get more creative. To talk not just about our emotions, like whiny babies, but to talk about what-ifs and possibilities and alternatives and all kinds of imaginary stuff that previously we just kept to ourselves instead of sharing it and embarrassing everybody. Language was our first virtual reality. It destroyed our idyllic pre-Neanderthal civilization and led us down that slippery slope straight to the Kardashians.",a4180362-96ec-4693-82cf-568a5fdeec77,Blog,2015-09-26T18:06:01Z,Hypergrid Business,10 technologies that have already destroyed civilization,1.0,Blog

1299,"The following recap was provided by the Pittsburgh Riverhounds 
 
PITTSBURGH (Sept. 16, 2015) – The Pittsburgh Riverhounds tied the United Soccer League regular season champion Rochester Rhinos 1-1 Wednesday night at Highmark Stadium to set up a pulsating finale to the Eastern Conference this Saturday night in Harrisburg. 
 
The result allied with victories for the Harrisburg City Islanders and Richmond Kickers Wednesday leaves the Hounds needing to win in Pennsylvania’s state capital to clinch a spot in the USL playoffs. A tie or a loss will end the Hounds’ season. 
 
Lebo Moloto broke the deadlock after 69 minutes of a typically cagey affair against the Rhinos with a brilliant curling shot from 30 yards. Christian Volesky leveled for the visitors with seven minutes remaining. 
 
“We didn’t play well in the first half and we played into their style,” said Hounds head coach Mark Steffens. “I thought we did well defensively and had the better of the play in the second half. 
 
“I’m proud of the guys.” 
 
The Hounds (10-9-8, 38 points) lie in eighth place going into the final weekend. Harrisburg (11-10-6, 39 points) sits one point and one place ahead after thumping F.C. Montreal 5-0 earlier in the evening. Three points Saturday will pull Pittsburgh level with the fifth-placed Richmond Kickers (10-7-11, 41 points). Steffens’ men hold the head-to-head advantage over the Virginians. 
 
A scoreless first half was played to the tempo that the Rhinos preferred. Rochester’s towering fullback Onua Obasi proved prolific in winning his challenges and creating potentially dangerous turnovers in the midfield. 
 
Rochester forward Steevan Dos Santos came closest to finding the net in the opening period with a low shot on 34 minutes that Hounds’ goalkeeper Calle Brown tipped onto his right post. 
 
Max Touloute looked lively early in the game after receiving his first start since Aug. 22. The Haitian forward dribbled through multiple opponents on 17 minutes before going down under a fair challenge in the penalty area. Kevin Kerr released Touloute into space on the right side on 29 minutes. Rochester’s stuffy defense closed him out before he could get his cross over toward the lurking Vini Dantas. 
 
Moloto netted his fifth goal of his first year in Pittsburgh with a stunning finish that left Rhinos goalkeeper Adam Grinwis helpless. The South African playmaker spun toward Rochester’s goal after receiving a pass from Rob Vincent before creating space via a sharp one-two with substitute Miro Cabrilo. Moloto arched a spectacular shot high above Grinwis’ reach and into the goalkeeper’s top left corner. 
 
Grinwis was much more active in the second half. Cabrilo hit a wicked shot on 81 minutes that looked to be slicing towards the far post until the Michigan Bucks product touched it wide. 
 
Holding onto late leads has been the Hounds’ Achilles heel this season. They were outdone again by a rapid Rhinos sequence when substitutes Colin Rolfe and Nate Bordeau combined to send Volesky clear on Brown’s goal. The 23-year-old forward clipped a neat finish over the sprawling goalkeeper. 
 
Vincent almost won it for the Hounds on a 20-yard free kick two minutes later. The Steel Army’s Player of the Year unleashed a ferocious drive that drew an exceptional diving save out of Grinwis. 
 
The Hounds travel to Harrisburg also holding the edge in the Keystone Derby series by virtue of two wins to the Islanders’ one. Kevin Kerr’s hat trick fired the Hounds to a 5-2 victory at Highmark Stadium to open the season back on March 28. Kerr then supplied the dramatic late winner on May 30 when Pittsburgh recovered from a 5-3 deficit in the final minute to record an incredible 6-5 win. 
 
Harrisburg pulled off its own breathtaking comeback at the Skyline Sports Complex on July 26 to recover from 3-1 down with 10 men to win 4-3 in stoppage time. 
 
A tie will be enough for the Riverhounds to lift the inaugural Keystone Derby Cup. Harrisburg must win by at least a 3-goal margin to keep the trophy in the Pennsylvania state capital during the offseason.

PGH – Lebo Moloto 69′ (Miro Cabrilo, Rob Vincent)

8787,"Wait. It has become something of a curse word for our society. Often times greeted with a huff or a sigh. As a whole, we don’t like waiting. In fact, I would venture that it can often pull out of us a big, strong emotion like hate. 
 
We don’t like waiting for anything. Checking out at the grocery store. Oil changes. Meals. Much less something like a job, healing, financial provision, that deal to finalize. Waiting just stinks. It’s countercultural. We live in a “do and make it happen” world. 
 
In case we weren’t fully clear on the meaning, Webster’s defines wait this way: 
  
:to stay in a place until an expected event happens, until someone arrives, until it is your turn to do something, etc. 
:to remain in a state in which you expect or hope that something will happen soon 
:to remain stationary in readiness or expectation 
  
Yes, yes and yes … right? 
 
Recently our church was challenged with listening to Psalm 23 every night for a period of time. It all started out fun until the words started piercing my heart. 
 
“The Lord is my shepherd. I lack nothing.” I lack nothing? 
“He makes me to lie down in green pastures.” Makes? He doesn’t ask me to lie down? What if I don’t feel like I need to lie down? 
“He leads beside quite waters, He refreshes my soul.” I like the refreshing part, but quiet waters sounds … well, boring. 
 
Let’s dig deeper. 
 
“I lack nothing”: Here’s the real issue in my life. I look too far ahead and at times I don’t live out that He is enough. I look left and right and all around and see a lot of what I don’t have, a lot of what I think I need and it distracts me from running my race. When the reality is, Jesus is enough. He’s done enough, He provides enough and in this moment I truly have all I need in Him for what He is asking of me. 
 
“He makes me lie down”: This is the wait. So what am I doing in my season of waiting? Am I accepting this invitation to be still with Him, to see Him and know Him? Or am I anxiously working towards my own plans? 
 
Here’s where it can get painful. Am I worshiping Him? Right now, in this moment, am I choosing to worship Him for who He is and what He’s already done? Or am I waiting until my thing comes or my wait is over to worship? Now is the time. He is worthy of our praise! 
 
“He guides me along the right paths for His names sake”: Boom. And there it is. His name’s sake. Friends, we’ve been sold a lie to believe that this life is about us. That it’s our time or our moment, our decision to make, that it’s all about us. 
 
Acts 20:24 tells us, 
 
“But my life is worth nothing to me unless I use it for finishing the work assigned me by the Lord Jesus – the work of telling others the Good News about the wonderful grace of God.” 
 
We were made for His glory and ultimately to reflect Him in every work He brings us to. You are not supposed to run the race of your friend, your neighbor or that random person on Instagram. You and I have our own assignment that’s as unique as each of us. That’s the focus. That’s the goal. Your race for you. My race for me. 
 
When I’m restless in the wait, I need to go back and reflect on Whose I am and everything He has already done for me. Like, salvation. People, I am alive in Christ! 
 
Hello? 
 
I said – once I was dead, but now I’m ALIVE! Sing and shout! AMEN! Do I really need anything else? Every single thing beyond salvation is a +1 in our blessings column. He loves us. He saved us. And He longs to bless those who love and serve Him. Believe and walk in that. 
 
The Lord will work out His plans for my life – for your faithful love, O Lord, endures forever. Don’t abandon me, for you have made me. Psalm 138:8 
 
So, perhaps all my anxiousness is really because I’ve placed me at the center of my life. My timing. My glory. When in fact, it’s all about Him. 
 
Will I believe His heart when I can’t see His plan? Will I live for His glory no matter where this journey takes me? Faith believes in the unseen and, in Jesus, it believes the unseen it is good – by His standards and not mine (Romans 12:2). 
 
I left this verse for last because it’s all too often heartlessly quoted by well-meaning Christians. But hang with me. Read Romans 8:28-30 this way. 
  
… we know that in all things God works [Stop. Ponder that.] 
… to conform to the likeness of His Son [Think on that.] 
… What shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us? 
  
Do you see? All of this [His work] is so that we can be made like His Son. Every wait, every pain, every delayed happening has purpose. A good purpose – to make us like Jesus. 
 
Don’t waste the wait!",d40a0a81-6fe2-46d4-b4ff-eb33f72ce02e,Blog,2015-09-23T05:44:36Z,Internet Cafe Devotions,The Wait,1.0,News

Afternoon light and haze, clearing storm clouds, eastern Sierra Nevada 
 
In early August I was (of course!) once again in the Sierra for several days. This time the main event was to be a short backpacking trip with long-time back-country friends — a “taking it easy” trip to a beautiful group of lakes in the Rock Creek drainage. Our plan was to meet on at the trailhead or on the trail, to do the short hike to a central lake, set up a base camp, and relax and explore for a few days. 
 
I decided to head up early, partly to have a bit of time to adapt the elevation, but also to do a bit of photography. (My backpacking partners were more “normal” people — not “abnormal” photograph-obsessed folks like me!) Arriving in the Yosemite high country at noon on a Friday in August, I did not spend much time at all trying to find a campsite there, instead heading straight over the crest and down to a less crowded spot. With camp set up, it was time to go make some photographs. Taking advantage of my east side location, I decided to head south a short distance along US 395, where I could find beautiful vistas of high desert terrain rising to the crest of the Sierra Nevada, augmented on this day by dissipating storm clouds and a bit of haze from early season wildfires.

8585,"A tropical storm that’s expected to head toward New Jersey has become a hurricane, the National Weather Service said.
Tropical Storm Joaquin’s maximum sustained wind speed increased to 65 miles per hour Tuesday afternoon, but the storm could pack winds as high as 90 to 100 mph once it approaches the East Coast, according to the National Hurricane Center.
The National Hurricane Center declared it a hurricane at 8 a.m. on Wednesday.
The National Hurricane Center and The Weather Channel said the storm could reach the New Jersey-Pennsylvania region by late Sunday or early Monday morning.
To reach hurricane status, wind speeds need to hit a sustained 74 miles per hour, just a nine-mile-per-hour increase from Joaquin’s current strength.
The storm was spinning Tuesday afternoon toward the Bahamas, but the National Weather Service expects it to cut north Friday.
The National Weather Service has issued its first warning in weeks, saying Joaquin is expected to move northward toward the Mid-Atlantic coast. Depending on the track, another round of potential heavy rainful may result in flooding.
Initial projections had the storm touching the Southeast, but that forecast was later changed to show its path pointed toward the Eastern tip of North Carolina by Sunday afternoon.
“Consensus has rapidly formed that tropical weather impact risk has escalated sharply, and is now abnormally high,” Gary Szatkowski, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in New Jersey, wrote on his Twitter account.
More from Lacey Patch Considering College? Fair Has 125 Possibilities For Your FutureWEATHER ALERT: Tropical Storm Joaquin Expected To Move Toward N.J.Don't Forget Your Free Cup Of Coffee TodayPatch Localstream: OCVTSPatch Localstream: Lacey Boys Lacrosse Boosters Club Various weather services emphasized that the tropical storm’s path is pretty uncertain and could definitely change - and may not make landfall at all.
Even if it doesn’t strike the coast, it will still have noticeable weather effects.
“Regardless of the ultimate outcome of Joaquin’s path, portions of the East Coast will still see multiple impacts from the evolving large-scale weather pattern, including flooding rainfall, gusty winds, high surf, beach erosion and some coastal flooding,” the Weather Channel says.
The Weather Channel described Joaquin as a “difficult forecast,” with four different weather patterns making life tough for forecasters.
Here are the current elements influencing the storm, according to the Weather Channel:A cold front near the East CoastRemnants of Tropical Storm Ida in the Southeast AtlanticHigh pressure over the North AtlanticLow pressure approaching the Southeast
“Joaquin’s future depends critically on the position and relative strength of those players,” the Weather Channel says. “Not to mention its own strength, which is currently being limited by strong wind shear that’s keeping most of its thunderstorm activity south of its center of circulation.”

6773,"Jason Pierre-Paul  No Finger, No Problem ...  BACK IN THE GYM!!  
 14 minutes ago BY TMZ STAFF   
breaking news 
 
Giants fans looking for a boost, look no further than this video of Jason Pierre-Paul -- ON HIS GRIND, in the gym, and apparently ... ready to bounce back from his horrific hand injury. 
  
The G-Men's former all-pro defensive end posted a video of himself running sprints with a sled strapped to his waist. Dude's hauling weight too ... about 270 pounds! 
 
It's the first time JPP's been seen without a huge cast on his hand since 4th of July weekend, when he blew off at least one finger from his right hand in a firework accident. Hard to tell from the video if he's still sporting any bandages. 
 
So, does this mean Jason's on the verge of a comeback? In the post he says, ""God can turn any situation around for the better. Your hard times will lead to the best times of your life. Don't believe the hype ... Be back soon! #90PC #ImAFighter #PutMeInCoach""

3580,"Universities which regularly provide platforms to extremist hate preachers will be named and shamed today by Prime Minister David Cameron. 
 
A list of universities, which includes King’s College London, Queen Mary University, SOAS and Kingston University, all in London, will be released. 
 
Mr Cameron plans to reveal the universities as places where Islamist fanatics are allowed to flourish. 
 
He will tell universities that they must stop giving extremists “the oxygen they need to flourish”, and will announce a legal duty for universities to stop extremists from targeting students. 
      
The plans have been criticised by some student bodies and university heads, who say freedom of speech could be damaged if they are forced to block speakers. 
 
Mr Cameron will say: “All public institutions have a role to play in rooting out and challenging extremism. It is not about oppressing free speech or stifling academic freedom, it is about making sure that radical views and ideas are not given the oxygen they need to flourish. 
 
“Schools, universities and colleges, more than anywhere else, have a duty to protect impressionable young minds and ensure that our young people are given every opportunity to reach their potential. That is what our one nation government is focused on delivering.” 
 
This follows on from some 70 events in the past year, which involved hate preachers. 
 
Some universities have blocked speakers in the past year, such as anti-gay imam Haitham al-Haddad, who had been set to speak at the University of Westminster and Kent University. 
 
Universities will, from 21 September, have a legal duty to put in place policies to block extremists from radicalising students.",f7b16545-9ce0-4261-a56d-243f78721479,News,2015-09-17T09:57:11Z,Pink News,British universities hosting extremist speakers to be named and shamed by David Cameron,0.0,News
595,"Red Bull driver Daniil Kvyat was fastest in second practice for the Japanese Grand Prix as heavy rain played havoc in both sessions on Friday. 
 
The Russian, who completed just six laps, posted a best time of one minute and 48.277 seconds to head the Mercedes pair of Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton in the order. 
 
Earlier on Friday, Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz finished on top of the timesheets for the first time in his grand prix career, with only 12 of the 20 drivers bothering to post a time in the rain. 
 
The sport of Formula One is back in Suzuka for the first time since Frenchman Jules Bianchi's fatal crash. 
 
And the miserable conditions here on Friday were eerily similar to those which saw Bianchi skid off the track and hit the side of a crane deployed to recover Adrian Sutil's stricken Sauber in last year's tragic race. 
 
Bianchi never regained conciousness and died nine months later on July 17. 
 
On Friday, the rain had been expected to ease throughout the day, but  persistent  showers were detrimental to both sessions. 
 
Sebastian Vettel, winner last time out in Singapore, was among a host of drivers to fall foul of the slippery conditions after he ran off the track at turn one. His Ferrari team-mate, Kimi Raikkonen, and Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo, who was fourth, also endured hairy moments. 
 
The forecast is for dry running for the remainder of the weekend making Friday's times, in front of the fanatical Japanese fans, largely irrelevant. 
 
Hamilton will head into Sundays' race with a 41-point margin over Rosberg. Vettel, fifth fastest in practice, is eight points further back. 
 
Jenson Button, whose Formula one future remains shrouded in mystery, was 12th, 3.5 seconds slower than Kvyat while his McLaren team-mate Fernando Alonso, who spent much of the second session as a bystander, only 17th.

And, uh, that can have a profound effect in terms of his adventurism, so we can use our energy and those sources. We sit between two oceans. Can you imagine all the hydroelectric power that is available to us if we begin to do the appropriate types of research into that? And a lot of the money that we generate, once we get over our aversion to using our energy appropriately, can be used to fund the research into other renewable energy sources.

We can work in a cooperative way, uh, because development of energy is critical for our future.

365,"In other words, selfies are killing more people than sharks. While it’s been documented that eight people lost their lives this year due to sharks, ScienceAlert is reporting that more people worldwide — at least 12 — have passed away this year due to a selfie-related incident. In other words, selfies are killing more people than sharks. The latest death by selfie victim was a 66-year-old Japanese tourist who slipped down the steps at Taj Mahal’s Royal Gate in India. Other selfie fatalities include the picture taker falling off a cliff, crashing their car, being run over by a train, or accidentally shooting themselves.

So what exactly is going on here? “Part of what happens when a person gets focused and self-absorbed in something — whether it’s their personal problems, a crisis at work or even taking a selfie — they become so immersed to the point where they get distracted and ignore almost everything else that’s around them,” says Stacy Kaiser, licensed psychotherapist. “And in the case of selfies, people are dying because they’re not seeing that cliff or noticing the car that is about to hit them.”

In some situations, Kaiser believes that taking selfies, in its simplest form, can be viewed as fun and trendy. “But on a deeper level, there’s a narcissistic element,” she states. “It’s a way of saying, ‘Look at me! Look how great I look! Look where I am! Everyone needs to see it and know about it!’ It’s attention seeking behavior. There has actually been re about the more narcissistic you are, the more selfies you take.”

As for the selfie craze, Kaiser doesn’t see it fading any time in the near future. “It’s spreading and becoming even more part of what is considered socially acceptable.” Just be careful out there.

The Las Vegas High football team has defeated Rancho 19 straight seasons in the ""Bone Game"" rivalry. 

Tonight, when the teams met at 7 at Rancho, the Wildcats are again expected to win in convincing fashion. 

Yet, despite the lopsided scores in recent years, the evening still remains as one of best in Southern Nevada during the prep season. 

This is the 59th time the schools — two of the original in the area — have played each other, meaning the outcome is only part of the fun. The stands are always packed, especially with alumni from each school, and there’s plenty of pageantry outside the game with competitions between the student councils and bands. 

And, Rancho might put up a fight this season. 

The Rams (2-2) snapped a 30-game losing streak earlier this month and appear to heading the right direction. Las Vegas has young players at most key positions, but have scored at least five touchdowns in each of its three games this season. Rancho, on the other hand, failed to score last week against Virgin Valley. 

This isn’t the lone game of interest tonight.

6623,"Houston Texans quarterback Ryan Mallett is expected to start Week 2. Head coach Bill O'Brien wants to go with the more physically gifted of his quarterbacks. The Brian Hoyer experiment lasted just a few quarters. Last week in relief of Hoyer, Mallett went 8-of-14 for 98 yards and a touchdown. Mallett is more of a question mark but also has much more upside. Fantasy Analysis:
Hoyer definitely wasn't worth having on your roster. However, Mallett may be worth a stash. We really don't know how he's going to be. Nonetheless, he has a very good arm and has DeAndre Hopkins in his back pocket. Arian Foster should be returning soon as well. That's a lot of talent for him to work with and O'Brien is an excellent coach.

According to ESPN, there are often empty seats at the women’s final. However this year the grand slam hasn’t started yet (it starts on Monday,) and yet there are no tickets left. And it’s all because of Serena Williams. If Williams wins the finals of the US Open she will be the first woman to win all four grand slams in a single season since Stefi Graff (Graff did so back in 1998). On top of all her glory on court, Serena Williams has been winning battles off court too.  She recently called out body shamers who referred to her as ‘manly’.?= display_ad('x18', 'hidden-xs hidden-md mm_incontent', 'MM In Content'); ??= display_ad('x20', 'visible-xs mm_mob_incontent', 'MM In Content (Mobile)'); ? (Post continues after the video)… Williams took to the media to call out her body shamers, telling America’s abc news, “I just don’t have time to be brought down. I have too many things to do, you know. I have Grand Slams to win. I have people to inspire. And that’s what I’m here for.” And in other sporting news this week… Our women’s cricket team, The Southern Stars, have regained the Ashes by defeating England on home turf. The host’s secured a five-wicket win over Australia in Cardiff last Monday, but it wasn’t enough to take out the test. The Southern Stars had already secured the Women’s Ashes overall in the multi-format series with a 20-run win at Hove on the 28th August.  Australia thrashed England by 161 runs in an earlier test in the series. Australia’s women’s water polo team has finished in a disappointing fourth place at the Kazan World Championships, leaving the Stingers coach Greg McFadden with some difficult decisions to make ahead of an Olympic training camp.  Training at the mid-September camp will give the players and coaches time to re-group before the 21-member squad is cut down to a final 13 for the Olympic team.
Finally to netball, Melbourne Vixens defender Jo Weston will be joining the Diamond’s squad for Australia’s four-test Constellation Cup against New Zealand next month. The 15-player squad includes nine players returning from Australia’s World Cup victory in August and four debutants, including 21-year-old Weston.

Wellstat Therapeutics has announced that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review the New Drug Application (NDA) for uridine triacetate as an antidote for patients at risk of serious toxicity following an overdose of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and patients who exhibit serious toxicity within 96 hours of being treated with 5-FU. 
 
Overexposure to 5-FU can occur if the drug has been administered at a dose or rate greater than intended, or when a patient has genetic variations, impaired clearance or other biochemical factors that increase sensitivity to the drug. Serious, sometimes life-threatening, 5-FU toxicity has occurred in an estimated 10-20% of patients treated with 5-FU. Administration of uridine triacetate can reduce the ability of toxic 5-FU metabolites to incorporate into the genetic material of healthy cells, enabling cellular recovery after overexposure to 5-FU and preventing cell death. 
 
RELATED: First Drug for Hereditary Orotic Aciduria Approved 
 
In 2009, the FDA granted uridine triacetate Orphan Drug status as an antidote for 5-FU poisoning. Under an expanded access protocol and under FDA emergency treatment provisions, uridine triacetate is currently provided to patients at risk of excess 5-FU toxicity due to overdose and patients exhibiting serious toxicities to 5-FU within 96 hours of 5-FU administration.

278,"Mountain bikers who thought they had missed their chance to ride South Africa’s most beautiful race, the Liberty Cape Winelands MTB Encounter, have another chance to enter thanks to an added investment from the title sponsor. 
 
Co-organiser Wynand de Villiers of ASG Events confirmed that Liberty had increased its commitment for the second edition of the three-stage race, which takes place from April 15 to 17 next year. 
 
The 180km event showcases the finest Western Cape mountain biking terrain as it traverses the beautiful Boland mountains, valleys and vineyards between the historic towns of Stellenbosch, Franschhoek, Paarl and Wellington. 
 
According to De Villiers, the enlarged sponsorship had enabled organisers to expand the hosting capacity of each of the registration and race venues, which include the Lanzerac Hotel, Le Franschhoek Hotel and Kleinevalleij Estate. 
 
“We can now comfortably accommodate 300 teams at the event, which means we are re-opening our entry portal and making a further hundred team entries available.” 
 
He said entries would close once the additional slots had been filled. 
 
His fellow organiser, Johan Kriegler of MTB Adventures, added that his route building teams were already hard at work perfecting the trails ahead of the event. 
 
“In the Boland, we’ve got the mountains, awesome fynbos and fauna, great trails and stunning venues that all complement one another. 
 
“It’s a perfect fit and not something you’re going to find anywhere else in South Africa.” 
 
Kriegler, who is also the founder of some of the most popular multistage mountain biking events in the country, said the secret of a great race was to strive for an unequalled mix of trails, view and venues. 
 
“Life is all about doing everything in balance. Most riders want a great time on the bike, exploring nature, having a good workout and still getting back to the race village by lunchtime to swap war stories.” 
 
He said the daily stages would be a manageable 55km to 70km, with climbs not exceeding 1 500m. 
 
“We’re cutting out all the unnecessary climbs and building contour trails to create spectacular vistas with maximum impact. 
 
“You want to build a trail where the scenery surprises you. Where a tunnel through dense vegetation suddenly opens up, or a winding trail turns another corner, and delivers a breath-taking view.” 
 
While some of the trails would be open to the public, Kriegler said the key linking sections would be exclusively used by the race.

This summer’s transfer window may have been a profitable one for Liverpool, but Brendan Rodgers is already turning his attentions to next year’s market. 
 
That’s according to reports that suggest the Reds continue to send scouts to watch Real Betis midfielder Dani Ceballos, ahead of a possible bid for his services in the future. 
 
The youngster has less than a year remaining on his contract and a buy-out clause of £7.5million, with Liverpool having the option to attempt to purchase him for a cut-price fee in January. 
 

 
It’s said they will face competition from Arsenal, with Ceballos looking likely to sign a pre-contract agreement for an English move next year. 
 Balotelli's Real joke  
Meanwhile Mario Balotelli has admitted that Real Madrid are a ‘dream club’, refuting reports that he made a joke about them in the past. 
 
The Italian took to Twitter to slam those who said he had aimed a dig at Real via a statement about Barcelona, claiming he would never make fun of Los Blancos. 
 Rooney on Sterling  
Bringing up the rear Wayne Rooney has had his say on Raheem Sterling’s controversial Anfield departure, and he has backed it. 
 

 
The Manchester United forward said that he thought Sterling seemed ‘settled’ at Man City and had started the season excellenty. That can only mean good things for the Three Lions.

4769,"Mae ...
Today Mae proudly walked 5km for her sister Phoebe and all of the kids at St.Jude. She raised close to $1500 by making and selling rainbow loom bracelets. We are very proud of her. 
Mae was just 23 months when her baby sister was diagnosed with cancer and like Phoebe, she has grown up and experienced many firsts and milestones in the hospital. 
Despite the struggles and heartache that has shaped her life, Mae shines. She is like a breath of fresh air and although she is only 6 years old, she is wise beyond her years. If you ask her, she will tell you everything you ever wanted to know about the immune system, blood, children's hospitals and her sister Phoebe. 
This year has been so hard. It has been by far the most difficult despite everything we had already been through. Mae has been witness to too many traumatizing and devastating things. She has sat quietly as doctors have discussed infections, strokes, seizures, cancer, and terrible odds. She has seen her baby sister scream in pain. She has walked beside us the many times Phoebe has been transferred to the ICU. She has seen Jon and I completely broken. She has asked if Phoebe will ever come home. She has watched as Phoebe is sedated. She has wondered out loud if the Phoebe that she loves so much would come back to her after a stroke and fungal infection in the brain caused her to be unrecognizable. She has sat by and held her little sister's hand through days that would cause the strongest people to completely break down. Despite a fungal infection that has left marks and scars on Phoebe's skin that are most likely permanent - Mae sees nothing but pure beautiful and brave Phoebe. Unlike some adults who have asked, ""what is wrong with your baby"", Mae chooses kindness and focuses on what is important. 
Mae talks about her dreams - she too dreams of cancer and of Phoebe. She says that ""the guys with swords are the bad guys, but then there are good guys with shields and they are protecting Phoebe"". I hope the good guys win, she says. 
She worries about Phoebe and has asked me the most heartbreaking things these past few months. Words that I can't bring myself to write down because it makes all of this even more real and heartbreaking. Questions about life and death and heaven. No six year old should dream of cancer and wonder where her friends have gone and if they are hurting. 
Throughout all of this heartache and trauma, time and time again, Mae chooses hope.
She has helped Phoebe learn to walk again after strokes and too much time in the hospital. She is the first to cheer her sister on as she tries something new. She has patiently waited for Phoebe to be well enough to play. Time and time again. She will do anything and everything for Phoebe and she knows that she helps Phoebe to heal and thrive. Despite many opportunities to go home - Mae chooses to stay in Memphis, ""because Phoebe needs me"". 
I have never seen love like the love that Mae has for her sister. It breaks my heart and fills me with pride all at the same time. 
September is childhood cancer awareness month - and a childhood cancer diagnosis affects the entire family. Siblings, like our sweet Mae, are often the unsung but very brave heroes. ",d3bb7220-e4fe-4deb-af54-beadc650842a,Blog,2015-09-26T22:44:58Z,Phoebe Rose Rocks,Mae,1.0,Blog
5523,"One of these days, perhaps, you will be able to go online and download and sign a petition calling for the repeal of the $1.4 billion in tax hikes — a nearly 17 percent increase in state spending — approved by your Republican-majority Nevada Legislature and signed by your Republican governor just months after the voters rejected two tax hikes at the ballot box — one of them by a margin of 4-to-1.

Earlier this summer a group calling themselves the We Decide Coalition filed such an initiative with Republican Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, asking that the matter go before the voters in November 2016.

The filing included a verbatim copy of the 100-page Senate Bill 483, which created a commerce tax (similar to the voter-rejected margin tax), hiked the cigarette tax $1 a pack, adjusted the payroll tax, made permanent certain “temporary” taxes, hiked business license fees, changed taxes on mining (a version of which was also rejected by voters), etc.

Knowing full well the initiative would be challenged in court because it addressed more than a single subject as required by law, a legislative land mine that has blown up many a petition effort, the group filed a pre-emptive lawsuit asking that the petition be declared a single subject because it addresses only one bill or, in the alternative, that SB483 be jettisoned as unconstitutional.

[caption id="""" align=""alignright"" width=""220""] Brian Sandoval[/caption]

The state Constitution requires: “Each law enacted by the Legislature shall embrace but one subject, and matter, properly connected therewith, which subject shall be briefly expressed in the title …”

Repeal proponents point out that SB483 amends 41 chapters and hundreds of sections, and amends, adds or deletes more than 87 separate freestanding sections of state law.

The status of that lawsuit is unclear since a group calling itself the Coalition for Nevada’s Future filed another suit in another state court challenging the legal standing of the petition over the single-subject law and over its “Description of Effect” filed with the repeal effort. Instead of describing the effect of repealing the law or letting it stand, the We Decide Coalition simply cut and pasted SB483’s title.

The suit points out that Nevada law “requires that an initiative petition set forth, in not more than 200 words, a ‘description of the effect of the initiative or referendum if the initiative or referendum is approved by the voters.’ The purpose of the description of effect is to help prevent voter confusion and promote informed decisions. The description of effect cannot be materially misleading, nor fail to identify the consequences of a referendum’s passage, and it must be straightforward, succinct, and nonargumentative.”

[caption id="""" align=""alignleft"" width=""200""] Chuck Muth[/caption]

One of the instigators of the petition, Chuck Muth, conceded the latter point and said the group plans to refile its petition with a new and improved description of effect.

Once that is done, the other coalition is expected to file suit against that petition and start the whole process over again.

There is a possibility somewhere along the line that someone might raise the issue of whether every state judge has a conflict of interest. Were the voters to get a chance to slash the state budget by nearly 17 percent, who knows where the cuts in spending might trickle down. To the courts, perhaps? But it is hard to see how federal courts could have jurisdiction in what are basically conflicts under state law and constitution.

Gov. Brian Sandoval has promised to fight the repeal effort tooth and nail, calling the petition “a wrongheaded attack on the children and families of Nevada. Supported by more than seventy percent of legislators, the revenue the petition seeks to eliminate will go directly to the classroom and give teachers the resources to deliver a quality education.”

Of course, the governor fails to note that the state has increased education spending 80 percent per pupil, adjusted for inflation, over the past 40 years with no detectible effect on student test scores.

More than a few legal knots will have to be untangled before we find out whether the voters themselves will get a chance to say whether they agree or not with this massive increase in spending and taxation.

584,"When Lightening Strikes.Via Sheri Gaynoron Sep 22, 2015	My sentinels—our communal horses—were restless, pacing the pasture side-by-side, stopping every so often, ears forward, heads high, to look northeast, toward the mountains in the far distance. Here in Northern California, we’d had a stretch of triple digit temperatures, with no relief in sight. Last Saturday by late afternoon the air was hot, dry and charged with static, and a strange wild, wind kicked up out of nowhere. The fire energy was palpable. The next day we got the news: Lake County was burning and it was bad. As the reports come in of the enormous devastation, I’ve felt completely helpless. Lost houses, lost lives, lost pets. Desperate pleas on Facebook posts with photos and telephone numbers, seeking word of loved ones, animals and any updates about homes and neighborhoods. Today I was finally able to help in some small way by delivering much needed supplies for horses and livestock to the Fairgrounds. What I witnessed stunned me. What you’re not seeing in the media reports are the hundreds of tents that are currently set up outside the Napa Fairgrounds, housing families and animals of all kinds. Think mini-Katrina with livestock and assorted four-leggeds. As someone who survived a fire evacuation in 1994 in Colorado, the Storm King Fire, one worst fires in history, the one that apparently, “wrote the manual” for firefighting going forward—14 firefighters lost their lives, trying to save our community—I understand first hand what it feels like to wonder if you have seen the last of your home, your pets and your possessions. The words anxiety and grief don’t cover it. I was living in a log cabin surrounded by BLM wilderness, when fire season started that summer—an annual and inevitable event. I made a list of things I would take with me in case a fire broke out. I don’t know why I did that; I’d never done it before. I set it on my desktop, so I wouldn’t have to “think” about it if the time came. When it came down to it, there were only five things on that list, all of them deeply personal and of enormous sentimental value. It’s interesting when it comes right down to it what’s important to us, really. Shortly after writing the list, I left Colorado to attend my grandmother’s funeral in Florida. It was literally during her ceremony when the phone started vibrating off the hook. My heart started to pound; I knew something was terribly wrong. The phone rang again, I looked down and saw my husband’s number, I left the funeral parlor and walked outside, relieved to know he was alive, “I don’t want you to worry, I’m fine and I have the dog, the fire has exploded, we’ve been evacuated, I took what I could.” The words hit me like a Mac truck. It started from a lightening strike, initially burning only three acres. When it touched down, it found exactly what it needed to grow and spread. By the time it overran the fire line jumping the highway and the riverbed, it had trapped and killed 14 courageous men and women and engulfed one side of our town. It was 4 days after that initial strike that the fire began climbing the hillside behind our home. As he sat in his truck out of harms way, on the other side of town, my husband described orange-red flames shooting 100 feet in the air licking the top of the ridgeline, above our home. That’s the trouble with fire. It doesn’t stay put. It’s a moving target and the laws of nature will take it where it wants to go. I still have no idea how those men and women stopped that fire where they did. When I returned home to see the fires path and the charred remains of homes, trees and the land, it seemed nothing short of a miracle. There are really no words that can accurately describe the feelings of gratitude I have for those who put their lives on the line every day in this way. We were lucky that year, “spared,” we were told, but somehow, you don’t feel that way, when you carry in your heart the weight of 14 lives and so many others—friends and neighbors—who weren’t as “fortunate.” As I drove home after dropping off the donations, I had time to process what I witnessed at the Fairgrounds, Revisiting the tents, tarps and mountains of donated clothing, in my minds eye, it hit me again: life can change in an instant. And then last night the rains came. On any other day it would have been cause for huge celebration. The water so critically needed, yet under the circumstances so brutal and unfair. These folks have been through so much, they didn’t need to spend a cold, wet night outside. It’s not a small thing to become homeless overnight and lose everything you’ve treasured, your livelihood…and your beloved pets. This is the definition of trauma.
As I head back to the fairgrounds to offer support, I am counting my blessings and grappling with the duality of life.

5293,"While the long-anticipated start to monetary tightening by the US Federal Reserve was unlikely to force panic selling, it could signal the start of renewed volatility in risk assets such as corporate bonds and overpriced growth stocks. 

A series of interest rate increases in the US could trigger asset selling that would dry up liquidity and lead to big losses for investors, the head of global credit for US-based investment manager AllianceBernstein​ says.

Ashish Shah said although the long-anticipated start to monetary tightening by the US Federal Reserve was unlikely to force panic selling, it could signal the start of renewed volatility in risk assets such as corporate bonds and overpriced growth stocks.

These have proved popular among yield-seeking investors – particularly from the retail side – since the advent of quantitative easing (QE), or bond buying, by the Fed and other central banks in the wake of the global financial crisis.

While the QE programs brought stability to sovereign bond markets and long-term financing, they had also given rise to crowded trades in credit, equity and other markets, Mr Shah said.

When financial markets are liquid, the easy match-up of buyers and sellers means pricing and timing suits both parties. However, a market event which triggers mass selling of an asset can quickly drive down prices if vendors far outnumber buyers.

The decline of proprietary trading by US investor banks because of regulatory changes had compounded problems of illiquidity, Mr Shah said, as had a growing tendency by fund managers, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other retail investors to trade bonds rather than hold them to maturity.

Even large institutional investors such as insurers and pension funds, which normally looked to cover long-term liabilities with long-dated investments, had become more skittish in times of market upheaval, he said.

The explosion in the popularity of ETFs had also widened the universe of investors looking to move in and out of assets to pocket short-term gains rather than sit on their investments, he said.

""The challenge with that is that they don't feel any transaction cost when they're allocating the risk; they go online, they click and they change an allocation,"" Mr Shah said.

His comments are the latest from a range of fixed-income experts to warn of price gyrations when the Fed's first tightening cycle in almost a decade gets under way.

A sell-off in emerging market and other high-risk assets in 2013 when the Fed first signalled it would wind down what became its $US3.5 trillion QE program gave the world a taste of what could ensue when the central bank actually started lifting interest rates.

The flight to safe haven assets became known as the ""taper tantrum"".

Futures market pricing suggests the Fed will not lift interest rates at this week's Open Market Committee meeting, which ends early on Friday Australian time.

Mr Shah agreed with this, but expected chairwoman Janet Yellen to leave no doubt in her statement about when and how the central bank would begin the tightening cycle.

""The market reacted very violently when the Fed talked about tapering,"" he said.

""But the reality of tapering was actually quite constructive while it was going on.

""I think [the Fed] would be better off hiking in the near-term, just to get it out of the way.""

05 September 2015, Papua New Guinea: A year after my last visit, there I was again, standing at the balcony of the New Century Hotel in Daru, watching houseboats, dugout canoes, and dinghies prepare to settle on the beach below as the tropic sun started to sink into the distant horizon.  The island of Daru is the former capital of the Western Province of Papua New Guinea.  It is a small dot in the Gulf of Papua just a few kilometers away from the mainland and very close to the border with Australia.

1839,"Google today announced the arrival of Street View in Sharjah and Ajman, a feature by Google Maps that will allow users to view and navigate 360 degree street-level imagery of major streets across the two Emirates. 
 

 
The first Street View Special Collect in the UAE was launched in 2013 for Burj Khalifa followed by the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Center and the Liwa desert in Abu Dhabi. In 2014, Dubai was the first Arab city to have Street View on a street level. 
 
  
 
Google Street View imagery provides users with a rich, immersive browsing experience and allows users to explore world landmarks, view natural wonders, navigate a trip or other points of interest. Street View was first launched in May 2007 and is already available in more than 3000 cities across 63 countries around the world. 
 

 
Some of the special areas captured by Street View are Al Noor Mosque, the Khor Fakkan and Kalba enclaves on the East, the Al Tamal camel track and the Al-Murabaa Watchtower on the Corniche. The Trekker equipment gathered imagery of the Al Majaz Waterfront and the Al Qasba with its “Eye of the Emirates”  ferris wheel. The Trekker equipment  is a wearable Street View backpack with a camera system on top that is designed to go down footpaths, tracks and narrow pathways to get images of areas of natural beauty or tourist sites.   
 
  
 
The Street View car covered the following streets in Sharjah: Al Khan, Al Wahda and Corniche Street – and the following streets in Ajman: Al Muntazah Street, Sheikh Rashid Bin Humeed, Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed and Sheikh Ammar Bin Humaid street.   
 

 
The Google street also returned to Sheikh Zayed road to update its imagery since its initial capture last year.   Antony McLoughlin, Street View Program Manager, for Google in Europe, Middle East and North Africa, said: 
 
“We have been expanding Street View across the UAE and hope to do add additional imagery in the future. Street View is a great feature that benefits users and businesses, we’ve received great feedback wherever we’ve launched around the world.” 
 
  
 
Street View Process   
 
Street View imagery is gathered by a vehicle equipped with advanced imaging technology— a camera mounted on the roof of a car that collects imagery and location data. After collection, the imagery is stitched together to create the 360° panoramic images that allows you to move around and explore locations as if you were there.   
 

 
Google is constantly improving its maps with tens of thousands of updates everyday throughout the world – from the latest road names, business addresses to public transit schedules and photos. Street View  provides easily accessible tools for flagging inappropriate or sensitive imagery for review and removal. Each image contains a link to a “Report a problem” tool where users can report objectionable images.

1413,"LABOUR SENATOR JIMMY Harte has formally resigned his Seanad seat nearly two years after sustaining a serious head injury after a fall in Dublin.

The Seanad was informed during the Order of Business this afternoon that the Donegal-based senator had formally resigned from the upper house.

Labour’s Seanad leader Ivana Bacik paid tribute to the Letterkenny native, saying he was “well known and well-loved by all of us”.

Harte was found unconscious with serious head injuries after an accidental fall on a Dublin street in 2013. He was found in Newmarket Square t about 4am on 16 November 2013, having earlier attended the Ireland versus Latvia football match at the Aviva Stadium.

The father-of-four was taken to St James’s Hospital but later transferred to Beaumont. Labour has previously said that Harte has been “making good progress in his recovery.

Harte was a hugely popular figure around Leinster House and politicians from all sides of the house offered their support and sympathies after the incident.

He joined Labour in 2010 and contested the 2011 general election in Donegal North East. He failed to win a seat, coming fourth in the three-seat constituency. Harte was subsequently elected to the Seanad Industrial and Commercial Panel in April of that year.

The resignation triggers another by-election of Oireachtas members for the vacant seat - nearly a year after Fine Gael’s John McNulty debacle. A motion will be moved in the Seanad tomorrow triggering the by-election process, which takes at least six weeks.

Speaking in the house today, Fine Gael’s Seanad leader Maurice Cummins paid tribute to Harte, saying he wished him and his family well.

Fianna Fáil Seanad leader Darragh O’Brien wished Harte “all health and happiness” in his retirement, describing him as an “absolute gentlemen” who would be missed.",c0a61f02-b21e-406b-a3af-2b2d84a9850f,News,2015-09-23T15:15:09Z,TheJournal.ie,Labour senator Jimmy Harte resigns from the Seanad,0.0,News

5346,"The University of Texas accepted the resignation of athletic director Steve Patterson on Tuesday, calling the parting a mutual decision. 
 
Barring a buyout agreement, Patterson is owed the $5.6 million remaining on his contract. 

School president Gregory Fenves led a conference call with the university board of regents on Monday night, when it was determined Patterson would be let go. Patterson was hired by Texas in November 2013. 

Fenves said in a statement, ""Steve brought important ideas and changes to our athletics program, and I appreciate the good things he accomplished in his time at UT. I wish him the best in his future endeavors. ... 

""Athletics is vitally important to the Longhorn nation, shining a bright light on the university. I look forward to continued success in our programs and seeing you all at games this year, supporting our teams and our student-athletes."" 

The university released a statement from Perrin that said, ""I'm honored to be asked by President Fenves to serve as interim men's athletic director. I will focus on helping the university find the best fit in a future director while listening to all the needs of the Longhorn family. As a former UT student-athlete, long-time fan and volunteer with Texas Athletics, I've worked closely with faculty, students, alumni, coaches and administrators. I will continue to do so in an effort to bring the Longhorn nation together."" 

Patterson said in a statement, ""As a Longhorn myself, a graduate of the University and its law school, I want nothing but the best for my alma mater, and I wish President Fenves and everyone at UT-Austin well as we continue the journey. I leave behind a motivated and dedicated team committed to the world-class standards that all Longhorns expect."" 

The Austin American Statesman reported that several donors have told Texas officials that they would no longer donate money to Longhorns athletics as long as Patterson was the athletic director. 

Houston attorney Michael Perrin was immediately installed as the interim athletic director on Tuesday. He will make $750,000 in a contract that runs through August 2016. 

Fenves was promoted from provost to university president in June. Reports regarding complaints about Patterson began to surface not long after. 

Among those complaints against Patterson were poor communication with donors, department employees and coaches. Other complaints involved the financing of a new tennis facility and the lack of transparency in the method used to deal with football season-ticket holders. 

Among his major decisions were parting with longtime football coach Mack Brown and basketball coach Rick Barnes, who was in Austin from 1998-2015. 

The coaches of major sports at Texas report to associate athletic director Arthur Johnson, who relays concerns or problems to Patterson. 

Another issue according to HornsDigest.com was that Patterson had not talked with his coaches regarding his decision on a new shoe contract. Nike is in the final month of a period of exclusive negotiation with Texas, and starting in October, Nike and Under Armour could engage in a bidding war to be the school's shoe and apparel sponsor. 

Patterson was in the third year of a guaranteed five-year deal paying him roughly $1.4 million annually. He was the athletic director at Arizona State before being hired by Texas.",03fd5f6f-12d8-47bf-b24b-58bd2b2989ba,News,2015-09-16T16:48:23Z,KION 46,Patterson out as Texas' athletic director,0.0,Blog

8710,"2015 NSCS Driver, Tony Stewart (Code 3 Associates) - Photo Credit: Todd Warshaw/Getty Images KANNAPOLIS, N.C.  Tony Stewart is no stranger to multitasking. Best known for his duties as a championship-winning driver, Stewart is also a championship-winning owner in both stock cars and sprint cars. On top of that, he is the owner and promoter of storied Eldora Speedway in Rossburg, Ohio, as well as a national sprint car touring series – the UNOH All Star Circuit of Champions. 
 
And those are just the highlights. 
 
While Stewart keeps a watchful eye over his business interests, he is quick to give credit to the people he has tasked with managing those properties. It’s what allows him to focus on his primary task of competing in the elite NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. It’s something that qualifies him for yet another role – ambassador for the companies that adorn the hood of his racecar. 
 
This weekend in the Sylvania 300 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway in Loudon, Stewart represents the efforts of Code 3 Associates. 
 
Code 3 Associates ( www.Code3Associates.org ) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to providing professional animal disaster response and resources to communities, as well as providing professional training to individuals and agencies involved in animal-related law enforcement and emergency response. Since launching in 1985, the mission of Code 3 Associates has remained the same – to provide hands-on animal rescue and care operations during disaster events in the United States and Canada, and through certified animal welfare training seminars, which include animal cruelty investigation training for officers. 
 
The continued operation of Code 3 Associates relies totally on the generosity of donors and the bravery of its responders. It’s a message Stewart aims to deliver with a strong run in his No. 14 Code 3 Associates/Mobil 1 Chevrolet SS this weekend at New Hampshire – a track where Stewart has spoken quite loudly in his 17-year Sprint Cup career. 
 
Stewart is a three-time Sprint Cup winner at New Hampshire and in the last 20 races at the 1.058-mile oval, he has led the most laps of any Sprint Cup driver – 971 laps, or 16.2 percent. Stewart’s 1,032 total laps led in 32 career Sprint Cup starts at Loudon ranks second only to the 1,371 laps led by Jeff Gordon, who has nine more starts than Stewart. Stewart and Gordon are the only two drivers to lead more than 800 laps at New Hampshire. 
 
Stewart, the three-time Sprint Cup champion, scored his first New Hampshire win in July 2000. He did it in dominating fashion, leading 156 of the 273 laps run in the rain-shortened race. New Hampshire win No. 2 came in July 2005, a year in which Stewart proved to be rock solid in the Granite State as he augmented his victory by finishing second in his September return. Of the 600 laps available in those two races, Stewart led 405 laps, or 67.5 percent. 
 
Even when Stewart left the comfort of Joe Gibbs Racing at the end of the 2008 season to become a driver/owner at Stewart-Haas Racing (SHR), his prowess at New Hampshire remained wicked good. Since 2009, Stewart has led 366 laps at New Hampshire with the high-water mark coming in 2011 when SHR swept the track’s poles and races. 
 
Former SHR driver Ryan Newman won the pole for the track’s July 2011 race and Stewart qualified second. The 1-2 start ended with a 1-2 finish, a feat that hadn’t been accomplished since Hendrick Motorsports started 1-2 and finished 1-2 in the 1989 Daytona 500. When the series returned to New Hampshire in September, Newman again won the pole, but it was Stewart who won the race. It was the first of a five-win campaign during the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup that enabled Stewart to win his third Sprint Cup championship, augmenting the titles he earned in 2002 and 2005. 
 
Stewart wears many hats, but his favorite remains his driver’s helmet. Always driven at New Hampshire, Stewart drives for Code 3 Associates. 
 
TONY STEWART, Driver of the No. 14 Code 3 Associates/Mobil 1 Chevrolet SS for Stewart-Haas Racing: 
 
Talk about the Code 3 Associates relationship and what it means to you. 
 
“I think everyone at Stewart-Haas Racing is very honored to have Code 3 Associates as a partner. Taking care of animals has always been important to me and, when we started our foundation, we made animal welfare a priority. To be able to promote the work of Code 3 Associates so that it can do even more work for people and their pets is very satisfying. For those who don’t know, whenever there is a disaster, Code 3 Associates is the organization out there that takes care of a family’s pet – the one family member that can get overlooked in a disaster situation. It’s a program I really enjoy being able to promote both on and off the track.” 
 
What do you like about New Hampshire? 
 
“There’s nothing tricky or fancy about it. It’s just a fun track. It just seems like it’s always been a fun driver’s track. Your car has to work well there but, when you get to racing guys, you’re trying to outbrake them, trying to get your car to turn, and you struggle for forward bite. It’s just got a little bit of everything the drivers look for to have a good race.” 
 
Explain a lap around New Hampshire. 
 
“It’s a big motor deal. With the corners being so tight, you’ve got to put a lot of gear in the car to get it up off the corner. Forward bite is always an issue there, too, so it’s hard to get up off the corners. Then, you’ve got long straightaways where you can kind of relax a little bit. Coming into the corners, you use a lot of brake and it’s hard to not only get the car stopped but to get it to turn. Then, you go through that challenge all over again.” 
 
What makes New Hampshire unique? 
 
“It just has long, sweeping corners. The corners, in comparison to where we normally race, we’re used to having a lot of banking, but New Hampshire is pretty flat. It’s one of those tracks where you’re either fighting entry-loose, entry-exit and nice in the center, or you’re fighting tight in the center and you’re good on entry and good on exit. It’s a juggling act trying to get the car balanced for all three sections of the corner.” 
 
Is New Hampshire a good place to race? 
 
“Obviously, I like it because I’ve had success there. But, at the same time, it’s a tough track to pass on. You can be a couple of tenths faster than another guy but it still takes you 20 laps to get by him. There are other tracks on the circuit where it’s hard to pass but we still go out and put on good shows there, too. Every race at Loudon seems to be a pretty good race. So, I like it. I enjoy racing there even though it is hard to pass. But, when you’ve got a good car, it’s always fun to race.” 
 
While you’ve won at New Hampshire, you’ve also had races where you’ve struggled. How can one race weekend turn out great and another turn into one you’d rather forget? 
 
“If you miss on something, it can be a miserable day. It seems like you don’t see but three or four guys during the day who really hit it. That’s what makes a day there miserable – when you miss.

5185,"CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (9/8/15)--For the first time, financial advisers in credit unions have averaged more investment revenues than brokers owned by large banks, according to a study released last week by Kehrer Beilan Research & Consulting (KBR&C). 
 
In 2014, the average credit union financial adviser produced $444,873 in investment services revenues, slightly more than in-house brokers at large banks, the Chapel Hill, N.C.-based firm said in The 2014-2015 Kehrer Bielan Credit Union Investment Services Benchmarking Study. 
 
It was the first time in the three years the study has been conducted that credit union advisers out produced bank advisers. 
 
“Although unprecedented, we could have seen this coming,” said Tim Kehrer, director of the survey and senior research analyst at KBR&C. The average financial adviser productivity of credit unions has improved three years in a row, increasing by 27% since 2012 and outpacing the banks’ growth, he said. 
 
Gross investment service revenues per adviser improved 16% in credit unions, compared with 6% in banks, from 2013 to 2014, 
 
Driving the growth was referrals of credit union members to financial advisers in credit unions. The average number of referrals per adviser rose 41% over 2013 referrals. Credit unions in the top quartile of adviser productivity provided 19% more referrals relative to their size than those with less productive advisors. 
 
In the study, the typical credit union referred just 1.5% of its member households to its advisors during 2014, indicating that “the number of advisers is not keeping with the growth in membership,” said Kehrer. 
 
The average credit union surveyed deployed one financial adviser for every 20,457 member households, a 9% increase from 2013. 
 
The study is based on data from 917 credit unions with investments services and an in-depth study of 46 credit unions about how their investment services work. The results were compared with a similar study of 17 large banks that own broker dealers.",11ac8246-0c9b-4510-b93b-19f6564dbbfb,News,2015-09-08T08:58:00Z,CUNA News Now,CU fin. advisers more productive than bank counterparts: study,0.0,Blog
5447,"They didn't raise rates. Do they know something investors don't? They didn't raise rates. Do they know something? 

On Wall Street, imaginations are racing over whether the Federal Reserve's refusal to boost interest rates says more about their view of the world economy than they are letting on. While equity bulls are happy for more months of zero-percent stimulus, a bigger issue is whether inaction bespeaks deeper concern about global growth at a time when corporate earnings have stopped going up in the US. 

In typically frenetic trading, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index ended Thursday with a loss, declining 0.3 per cent to 1990.2 and erasing a rally that reached 1.3 per cent at the beginning of Janet Yellen's press conference. Gains evaporated as the Fed chair spoke about the potential for stress in emerging markets to spill into the US. 

""That they didn't start today and continue to wait still gives caution that the underlying economy around the world isn't as strong as they like to see,"" said David Lyon, global investment specialist at JP Morgan Private Bank, which oversees about $US1 trillion. ""This becomes three months of additional time where the Fed decision is still the black cloud overhanging the market."" 

Another black cloud is not what equity traders were hoping for after corporate profits fell in the second quarter even as profit-based valuations reached the highest in five years. Since the third quarter of 2014, companies' quarterly profit growth has averaged 3 per cent in the S&P 500, down from 17 per cent since the bull market began. Focus is back on China 

Among other things, inaction by the Fed puts the focus back on concerns such as China's economy and plunging commodities, stresses that sparked a selloff in mid-August that at its worst erased more than $US7 trillion from global equity values. 

""The market will quickly turn around and say, hold on a minute, if they can't raise rates with unemployment where it is, then you're really worried about the potential impact with what's going in emerging markets and commodities and so on,"" said Stewart Richardson, chief investment officer at RMG Wealth Management in London. ""If they cant do it now, they'll never be able to do it."" 

The Fed's statement warned that economic and financial developments around the world may restrain economic activity and curb inflation. Yellen mentioned the outflow of capital from developing countries and pressures on emerging market currencies in her Q&A session. Bad news

The refusal to hike was bad news for a significant constituency of traders who hoped Yellen and her colleagues would get the first rate increase over with as a way of affirming faith in the US. No increase underpins concern that policy makers doubt that momentum seen in everything from American gross domestic product to retail sales will prove durable. 

""I'm completely and utterly bored sick of the whole thing and I think that it's completely irrelevant whether the Fed raises rates by 25 basis points,"" David Hussey, head of European equities at Manulife Asset Management in London, said before the decision. ""What is important is, is China really blowing up, is a recession about to happen in emerging markets, what's going to happen to commodity prices?"" 

Hike or not, the outcome of Thursday's meeting is sure to test resolve in an the world's biggest sharemarket, where the third- longest bull market on record has recently ground to a halt. The S&P 500, up almost 200 per cent in the 70 months through December, has fallen 3.3 per cent this year, including its first 10 per cent correction since 2011. Also-rans 

As the trend turned, US shares have changed from being among of the world's best investments, from 2010 to 2014, to rank also-rans. Over the first 5 1/2 years of the bull market the S&P 500 beat the MSCI All-Country World Index by more than 60 percentage points, rallying 204 per cent through 2014. Since the start of 2015, the US index is down about the same as the global gauge. 

""There could well be fears that it is due to a weakening growth environment, which will send a negative tone to equity markets,"" said Pau Morilla-Giner, the chief investment officer at London & Capital Group. ""This feels like a Catch 22 situation especially when one considers the low sentiment-high fear factor dominating equity markets currently."" 

Thursday's reaction extended the worst equity rout since 2011, a stretch dating to mid-August that began with concern over China's market meltdown and worsened as commodity prices tumbled and the dollar surged, potentially crimping profits at exporters. Even after rising in four of the five days before Thursday, the S&P 500 has lost 5.3 per cent over the past month. Equity rout continues 

Investors in the pro-rate hike camp point out that stocks have weathered Fed tightenings in the past. Since 1946, following the initiation of 12 tightening cycles defined by Ned Davis Research, the S&P 500 was higher a year later eight times and posted an average 12-month return of 2.5 per cent. 

But past tightenings also began when the stock market was much less turbulent than it is now. Over the month leading up to the 12 cycles since World War II, the S&P 500's average daily move, a rough measure of volatility, was less than 0.6 per cent - - 15 per cent lower than usual. While some investors said that meant markets were too unsettled to hike, the alternative could be worse. 

""The Fed's mandate isn't to cause stock returns,"" said George Schultze, who oversees $US200 million as founder and managing member of Schultze Assset Management in Purchase, New York. ""We're due for a higher rate now. If inflation continues to climb because interest rate policy is too aggressive for too long, it's a bigger risk for stocks.""

The toughest kid in the schoolyard was the bully. 
 
The pipeline company with the most money is now the bully. The pipeline company from Texas, Kinder Morgan, intends to install a high-pressure gas pipeline under the bike path in West Peabody. Just try and stop them. 
 
Who cares? (I don’t live in West Peabody). 
 
Who cares? (I don’t use the bike path). 
 
Who cares? (I don’t drink water). 
 
What? 
 
This Peabody bike path runs beside the Ipswich River, which is drinking water for 15 cities and towns. 
 
Kinder Morgan has stated it’ll take be a year to rip up the ground, tear down the trees, and bury this huge pipeline. 
 
How will they do it?...with construction equipment like bulldozers, steam shovels, tractors and portable diesel generators. This equipment doesn’t have to comply with the same pollution standards of diesel trucks and buses used on our roads. These machines use non-road diesel fuel, which contains as much as 200 times the sulfur that’s allowed in highway diesel fuel. The exhaust from these machines will settle into the Ipswich River. Do we really want families to drink this ‘new’ water? …to cook with it? 
 
Wake up Peabody (and all who drink from the Ipswich River). There’s a new bully in town.

5472,"BOULDER, Colo. — Michael Grab is a curious man, and that curiosity led him to his life passion: rock balancing. 
The phrase “rock balancing” doesn’t sound like much in and of itself, but in true practice, the meditative exercise involves “patience, adaptation, slow-breathing, steady hands and a plethora of other practiced skills” to be successful, according to Grab via his website. He calls much of his rock balancing “Gravity Glue,” but the only adhesive he uses is literally gravity with any three contact points found on any given rock. 
“Luckily, every rock is covered in a variety of tiny to large indentations that can act as a natural tripod for the rock to stand upright, or in most orientations you can think of, with other rocks,” he says. 

Grab — who is from Edmonton, Canada, but lives in Boulder, Colorado — began balancing in 2008 “on a whim,” but it soon because a passion that he practices every day. 

“I quickly noticed the unique effect that my creations had on myself and others, often inspiring a sense of magic and peace; a sense that anything is possible,” Grab says. 

The artist now travels around the world to give demonstrations of his perfectly balanced creations.

7013,"Highs for the past seven days: a survey.
Highs:
1.  I made time for rest.  Sleeping more, going to bed earlier.  Balance is critical if I am to thrive emotionally, spiritually and mentally.
2.  My right hand is improving. In constant pain, I remain since July 27th. My wrist was broken when I fell off my bike.  My grip is getting stronger.  I still can not turn a doorknob, to open a door.   Typing with both hands is now possible.  More range of movement with my hand and wrist helps me do things this week that I couldn't for a month: buttoning my pants and shirts, tying my shoes,  Fastening a belt, better at scrubbing the left side of my body. (I had to use my left hand.)
3.  I am internally
referented, abiding by my feelings, wants and values.  I do not let others opinion of me define who I am or determine my moods. I do not placate others.
4.  When relating with others, last week, I sought to know what is best for both us. I am not interested only in what is beneficial for me,   Nor do I deny myself, only looking at what is best for the other person.  I want to do what is in the best interest for everyone. That is Tradition 2 in recovery, something I have learned through being a consistent, dedicated member of Al-Anon Family Groups.
5.  Several opportunities to react in the past seven days.  I am thankful for principles that help me be emotionally mature.  It allows me to stay and be comfortable with negative feelings.  I do not rush to conclusions.  I state and see things as neutrally as possible, relying upon my senses only.
     No interpretations of me by others are wanted.  I rather relate than having another trying to control me with their judgments.  I live in a judgment-free zone.
How About You?
What were the best things that happened to you last week?
I am exhausted. I'll re-work this tomorrow, Tuesday.  Good night.",bf0bdd2a-20eb-47ec-a3de-354fc51985e5,Blog,2015-09-01T22:38:59Z,The Attitude of Gratitude Inn,High Points for Last Week,1.0,Blog

The above poll is based on the page B3 report, “Long Eid break spurs holiday bookings”, published in the Business section of Gulf News on September 3.

The report states that tour operators and hotels in the UAE have been receiving a large number of queries in light of a possible five-day long break that is likely to fall in the fourth week of September on account of Arafat or Hajj Day and Eid Al Adha.

We asked our online readers, what had they planned for the upcoming Eid Al Adha holidays? Majority of the respondents, 22 per cent, said they would be visiting family and friends. 

This shows that most of the respondents are keeping with their customs and traditions and spending time with their loved ones. 

However, Arafat Day is expected to fall on September 22, Tuesday and Eid Al Adha is likely to be on September 23 and 24, Wednesday and Thursday. If the succeeding weekend is included, the private sector employees are expected to have five consecutive days of vacation. If this happens, 20 per cent of the respondents are taking the opportunity to travel abroad for a quick getaway. 

What do have you planned for the Eid Al Adha holidays? Tell us at readers@gulfnews.com.

971,"DENVER (AP) – Tim Cullen smiled when he reckoned a one-day marijuana tax holiday in Colorado had probably saved him tens of thousands of dollars. 
 
Cuilen, the owner of Colorado Harvest Co., a chain of marijuana dispensaries, was among the many growers and shoppers who benefited Wednesday from a quirk that required the state to suspend a 10 percent sales tax and a 15 percent wholesale excise tax for a day. 
 
While shoppers saved roughly $20 an ounce, or about 33 cents per joint, pot growers saved $300 a pound. 
 
“I probably saved $45,000 before lunch,” Cullen said. 
 
Looking over a small tangle of pot shoppers in his suburban Denver shop, Cullen said the crowds weren’t huge but the tax break would be a big win anyway. 
 
“This is just gravy,” Cullen said about the shoppers. 
 
RELATED STORIES:   Marijuana Legalization Story Archive  
 
The odd tax waiver was triggered almost two years ago, when Colorado voters approved two taxes on recreational marijuana – a 10 percent sales tax for shoppers and a 15 percent excise tax for wholesale growers. 
 
Ahead of that vote, state tax analysts miscalculated overall state revenue for 2014. The error triggered a mandatory suspension of the new pot taxes. 
 
Lawmakers decided to waive the taxes only for a single day, though voters will have to return to polls in November to authorize the state to keep some $50 million in pot taxes collected in 2014. 
 
Confused? So were many shoppers Wednesday – but they loaded up on lower-cost weed anyway. 
 
“I’m just going to buy a little more than I normally do and hold onto it,” said 41-year-old Tim Persoff. 
 
(credit: CBS) 
 
Some out-of-state visitors were shocked to see the virtually tax-free sale of weed. (It was still subject to local taxes and Colorado’s basic 2.9 percent sales tax.) 
 
“I saw online there was some kind of loophole on the taxes, so I had to come buy some,” said David Illig of Onawa, Iowa, who was passing through on a drive to California. 
 
Colorado tracks marijuana sales but doesn’t make the data public, making it impossible to know if Wednesday set a single-day sales record. Several retailers said the day was akin to a busy holiday weekend. 
 
Still, shoppers and marijuana industry workers lauded the tax holiday as a needed break. 
 
In a statewide tally made final Tuesday, Colorado reported that it collected much more in marijuana-specific taxes last fiscal year than alcohol-specific taxes. 
 
“The cannabis community has brought so much money to the state of Colorado, this is only fair,” said Chad Drew, sales manager at Colorado Harvest Co.

627,". announced on Wednesday a new commitment of $70 million in community investments over the next three years to increase access to computer science education for all youth, and especially for those from under-represented backgrounds. Through the company's global YouthSpark initiative, scores of nonprofit organizations around the world will receive cash donations and other resources to provide computer science education to diverse populations of young people in their communities and prepare them with the computational-thinking and problem-solving skills necessary for success in an increasingly digital world. 

Invests $70 million in community programs to increase access to computer science education for all youth and build greater diversity into the tech talent pipeline. 

SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 16, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Microsoft Corp. announced on Wednesday a new commitment of $70 million in community investments over the next three years to increase access to computer science education for all youth, and especially for those from under-represented backgrounds. Through the company's global YouthSpark initiative, scores of nonprofit organizations around the world will receive cash donations and other resources to provide computer science education to diverse populations of young people in their communities and prepare them with the computational-thinking and problem-solving skills necessary for success in an increasingly digital world. 

""If we are going to solve tomorrow's global challenges, we must come together today to inspire young people everywhere with the promise of technology,"" said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. ""We can't leave anyone out. We're proud to make this $70 million investment in computer science education to create new opportunities for students across the spectrum of diverse youth and help build a tech talent pipeline that will spark new innovations for the future."" 

Over the next three years, Microsoft will deliver on this commitment through cash grants and nonprofit partnerships as well as unique program and content offerings to increase access to computer science education and build computational thinking skills for diverse populations of youth. One of the flagship programs is Technology Education and Literacy in Schools (TEALS), which pairs tech professionals from across the industry with classroom educators to team-teach computer science in U.S. high schools. TEALS aims to grow fivefold in the next three years, with the goal of working with 2,000 tech industry volunteers to reach 30,000 students in nearly 700 schools across 33 states. A key objective of TEALS is to support classroom educators as they learn the computer science coursework, preparing them to teach computer science independently after two years of team-teaching. 

Nadella reinforced the company's commitment to computer science education today during the annual Dreamforce conference hosted by Salesforce where he called upon thousands of tech professionals to serve as TEALS volunteers and help broaden the opportunity for students of all backgrounds to learn computer science in high school. 

""Computer science is a foundational subject — like algebra, chemistry or physics — for learning how the world works, yet it's offered in less than 25 percent of American high schools,"" said Microsoft President Brad Smith. ""We need to increase access to computer science and computational thinking for all students, especially those from diverse populations, by partnering across the industry and with teachers and schools to turn this situation around and change the paradigm for developing a more diverse tech talent pipeline."" 

There are three additional key elements of Microsoft's global commitment to increasing access for all youth to the full range of computing skills, from digital literacy to computer science. 

Global philanthropic investments with nonprofits in 80 countries, including the Center for Digital Inclusion in Latin America, Silatech in the Middle East and Africa, CoderDojo Foundation in Europe, YCAB Foundation in Asia, and many others, will deliver a range of computing skills from digital literacy to computer science education to youth in local communities around the world. 

Microsoft Imagine connects students with the tools, resources and experiences they need to turn their innovative ideas into reality. Whether it's building a game or designing an app, Microsoft Imagine makes learning to code easy and accessible for students and educators, no matter their age or skill level and at no cost. Whether it's free cloud services like Azure, online competitions via Imagine Cup that educators can incorporate into their curriculum, or fun self-serve learning tutorials, Microsoft Imagine helps bring a student's technology passion to life through computer science. 

YouthSpark Hub resources are designed to inspire youth about the full spectrum of computing skills, ranging from digital literacy to computer science engineering. In addition to providing access to the Microsoft Imagine tools, the YouthSpark Hub brings together opportunities to participate in activities such as DigiGirlz and YouthSpark Live, attend free YouthSpark Camps at the Microsoft Stores, and access training through nonprofit organizations supported by Microsoft around the world. 

Since 2012, Microsoft YouthSpark has created new opportunities for more than 300 million youth around the world, offering technology skills training and connections to employment, entrepreneurship, and continued education or training.

5619,"SAN FRANCISCO, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 09/10/15 -- Okta , the leading identity and mobility management company, today unveiled Okta Adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Okta Adaptive MFA offers companies a broad set of easy-to-use factors combined with policy-driven contextual access management that is informed by data from Okta's 2,500+ customers and their millions of devices, users and authentications. It is designed to provide an additional layer of protection to people, organizations and their most sensitive data while maintaining a simple user experience. 

""In our recent 'Businesses @ Work' report , we saw a 40-percent increase year-over-year in MFA adoption. This demand, combined with the rapid increase in data breaches and the opening of corporate networks as applications move to the cloud makes now the right time for Okta to launch this powerful, easy-to-use security product,"" said Eric Berg, Okta's chief product officer. ""Okta Adaptive MFA is for any organization that wants to proactively protect applications and their critical data. CIOs no longer need to compromise user experience while upholding their commitment to secure the business."" 
     
Okta Adaptive MFA product features include: 

Policy framework supporting contextual access management: Okta Adaptive MFA allows IT decision makers to set contextual access policies that require step-up authentication, or deny access, based on data about users, devices and the request, including the network, location or application. For example, if a U.S.-based user requests access from another country, Okta Adaptive MFA will require additional verification. Additional policies include re-authentication and enrollment rules, configurable session timeouts and group-specific password policies. 

Comprehensive set of second factors: Okta Adaptive MFA puts a heavy focus on factors that people want and like to use, such as Okta Verify with Push and Yubico's Yubikey . Okta's new partnership with Yubico integrates YubiKey hardware USB authentication devices to protect access to user accounts with a simple touch, making it fast and easy for users to securely access applications. Okta Adaptive MFA also supports SMS for users without access to smartphones, and integrates with factors from RSA, Duo Security, Symantec and Google. 

Adaptive, risk-based authentication leveraging Okta's expansive dataset: Okta Adaptive MFA will leverage risk profiling to make dynamic authentication decisions. Okta will make intelligent decisions and proactively protect organizations and industries by using behavioral patterns, combined with data from a network of global authentication trends to identify risk. Users will only be prompted for MFA when unusual or risky behavior is detected. 

Integration with the VPNs and applications that organizations need: With Okta Adaptive MFA, organizations can take advantage of the 500+ SAML-enabled applications in the Okta Application Network . Through Okta's RADIUS server agent, customers can integrate VPN and other on-prem infrastructure to centrally enforce MFA for all applications and network access, and protect applications that do not natively support MFA or specific factors. 

Okta Joins the FIDO Alliance 
Okta joins the FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance as Sponsor to contribute expertise in authentication, accelerate the adoption of MFA and improve universal authentication standards. The FIDO Alliance, officially formed in July 2012, operates as a cooperative industry initiative, providing the first open industry standards for online and digital authentication that emphasize security, privacy and a simplified user experience. 

London Gatwick Airport Chooses Okta for MFA 
Okta customer London Gatwick Airport, the second largest airport in the UK serving approximately 38 million annual passengers flying to 200+ destinations across 90 countries, chose Okta Adaptive MFA to secure access to cloud apps and the Internet for 2,600 employees. 

""London Gatwick Airport's employees are not just located in an office -- they're based in airport security, on the airfield, or in the terminals, so we need secure communications and access anywhere, anytime,"" said Michael Ibbitson, CIO of London Gatwick Airport. ""The risks involved make MFA for apps and services vital for data protection. We love the fact that Okta Adaptive MFA is easy to use and we can choose from factors like SMS and Okta Verify."" 

Okta Adaptive MFA is available today. To learn more, please visit: https://www.okta.com/product/adaptive-mfa/ 

ABOUT OKTA 
Okta is the foundation for secure connections between people and technology. By harnessing the power of the cloud, Okta allows people to access applications on any device at any time, while still enforcing strong security policies. It integrates directly with an organization's existing directories and identity systems, as well as 4,000+ applications. 

Because Okta runs on an integrated platform, organizations can implement the service quickly at large scale and low total cost.

Los Angeles • Bob Rand bought his Volkswagen Passat last year for its clean emissions and high gas mileage. He liked the car so much he convinced his son and a friend to buy one, too. 

Now, as Volkswagen comes clean about rigging diesel emissions to pass U.S. tests, Rand is desperately trying to sell the fully loaded model with white leather seats for $10,000 below what he paid. His sole bite has been from a man who offered $7,500 on speculation that he could resell it in Mexico. 

""Volkswagen was somebody that you could rely on for cutting-edge products and quality and all those things and now you find out that they're not above lying just flat out,"" said Rand, who plans to join a class-action lawsuit against VW. ""That's probably about as bad a thing as a company can do is lie to your face when you're buying a $35,000 car."" 

Rand's anger at the world's top-selling car company was echoed Wednesday by private dealers, auto wholesalers and owners across the U.S. as fallout from the smog test trickery mounted. 

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency first disclosed Friday that stealth software makes VW's 2009-2015 model cars powered by 2.0-liter diesel engines run cleaner during emissions tests than in actual driving. On Wednesday, Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn resigned and took responsibility for the ""irregularities"" found by U.S. inspectors — a scandal that has wiped out billions in the company's market value and raised the possibility of criminal investigations and billions more in fines. 

The revelations left dealers sitting on hundreds of diesel cars they could not sell. Many also dealt with a flood of angry calls, emails and tweets from Volkswagen owners who felt betrayed because they believed they had bought a car that polluted less without sacrificing the good gas mileage and performance that comes with a diesel engine. 

""I think their feet should be held to the fire. I think apologies don't mean anything when something is so premeditated,"" said Joe DeCarolis, of Cary, N.C., who owns a 2012 TDI Jetta Sport Wagon — a car he bought after careful comparison shopping for its clean emissions and good gas mileage. 

Dealers can't give customers good answers because Volkswagen hasn't said a whole lot, said AutoNation CEO Mike Jackson, the leader of the largest auto dealership chain in the U.S. 

AutoNation's six Volkswagen and eight Audi dealerships in the U.S. are telling customers that the cars are safe to drive and promising to call them as soon as they know more about repairs. ""That's not adequate,"" Jackson said. ""We need answers by next week."" 

A lot of people within VW had to know about the software that turned emissions controls on during government tests and off for regular driving, especially because the scheme went on for multiple years, Jackson said. 

""This tells me that it's not a bad apple. It's not a rogue employee. It's deliberate deception,"" Jackson said. ""It's a systemic failure. This took a lot of meetings. This took a lot of engineers. This took a lot of software programmers to put in place and keep in place."" 

Meanwhile, concern was growing at private dealerships about what to do with inventory that's now gathering dust.

6093,"ATLANTA: Jordan Spieth capped a brilliant season in sensational style as he scored a four-stroke victory at the Tour Championship on Sunday that also won him the FedEx Cup playoffs title for an $11.48 million pay day. Spieth shot a closing one-under-par 69 at East Lake Golf Club for a nine-under total of 271 and his fifth win of the season, including the Masters and US Open. The prize money haul included the $10 million jackpot bonus for winning the season’s FedEx Cup points competition, virtually clinched him Player of the Year honours and returned the 22-year-old American to the number one world ranking. 

Sweden’s Henrik Stenson rolled in a 57-foot birdie putt at the last for a 72 to tie for second on five-under 275 with Englishman Justin Rose (66) and Danny Lee of New Zealand (65). “This is incredible. This is an event that we approach like a major championship because we know this is possible at the end of it,” said Spieth after hoisting the silver FedEx Cup trophy. Spieth experienced a slight lull to his sensational season in the last month as Australian Jason Day went red-hot to win four of six events, including the PGA Championship and two of the FedEx Cup playoff tournaments. 

However, the ultra-competitive Spieth geared up for a run at the Tour Championship/FedEx Cup double and hit his target. “I got frustrated. I missed two cuts in a row, had never done that, lost the number one ranking. I was watching Jason Day just dominate golf,” said Spieth, whose PGA Tour season earnings ballooned to $22 million because of the FedEx Cup bonus. “I got to work, put my head down a little more than I did right after the PGA, knowing that we could still peak this week and that’s what we did.” 

Magic putter: Spieth once again wielded a magic putter to quash the hopes of his rivals. He began the day with a one-shot lead over Stenson, the 2013 FedEx Cup winner. He extended that advantage to two but after six holes the pair were tied when Spieth suffered a second consecutive bogey. With both players starting the week inside the top five in FedEx Cup points – and thus assured of winning the FedEx Cup by winning the tournament – it seemed to be a two-man game. 

Spieth took command on the eighth hole by rolling in a 21-foot birdie putt, while Stenson bogeyed for a two-shot swing. Then after Stenson knocked his approach close at the ninth, Spieth rolled in an 18-footer to maintain his advantage. Two holes later, Spieth rolled in 46-foot putt for birdie to retain his two-shot edge, drawing a wry grin from the Swede who acknowledged the American’s effort with a fist bump on the green. 

With Rose, Lee, Dustin Johnson (64), Bubba Watson (67) and Englishman Paul Casey, who reached six-under before bogeys at 16 and 17, making charges, Spieth continued to use his putter to hold them at bay. He saved par at the 15th with a putt from nine feet and did so again at 16, and Stenson gave him breathing room with a double-bogey at 17 after shanking his approach shot. “I didn’t quite get going today and Jordan was putting unbelievably well,” said Stenson, whose long birdie putt at the last moved him into second place in the final FedEx Cup standings for an extra $1 million and a total $3 million bonus. “Whenever he had to make a putt, he did it. So, very well-deserving champion.” ",fc2cf785-e43b-4177-bf39-9d379f8f299c,News,2015-09-29T02:48:53Z,Daily Times,Jordan Spieth earns £7.5m with Tour Championship victory,0.0,Blog

1231,"UPDATED Uber says Melbourne protests are being led by investors not taxi drivers. 

Uber has hit back at claims that its entry into Australia is hurting taxi drivers and small investors who hold taxi plates.

To get more Money more often, why not follow us on Twitter? We’re @FairfaxMoney 

Taxi drivers have been protesting in Melbourne this morning but the anger is felt by the taxi industry across the country. Some drivers say that they find it hard to compete with ride-sharing in their own cars. And investors who have put their life savings into owning taxi plates have seen their stakes shrink.

But despite the protests, Uber is bullish about its operations.

A spokesperson said: ""The leaders of these protests are taxi investors, not drivers.""

""These same investors are the ones who have kept drivers' wages low and working conditions poor for decades before Uber arrived.

""Instead of improving their own business, these plate owners are blaming others,"" the spokesperson said.

Uber is not to blame for taxi drivers' poor working conditions and taxi industry data shows that ""the taxi market has grown since Uber arrived,"" the spokesperson said.

One Brisbane taxi driver, Ross, who recently contacted Money, said he gets upset with ride-sharing because people do not understand the costs that go into a taxi.

There are the cameras that taxis have to have and car insurance of $6000 a year and ""security"" fees of $600 a year. And that is before the taxi driver put the keys into the ignition.

He said he has just put a new Toyota Aurion on the road at a cost of $46,000 and in Brisbane you see old Corollas being used for ride-sharing.

An older reader from NSW who does not want to be identified said he and his wife bought a taxi plate so that they would not have to go on to the pension.

But the value of the investment has fallen due to ride-sharing.

The retirees first bought a taxi plate in 2006 and it was worth about $440,000 in 2008. He reckons it is now worth about $320,000 or less because of ride-sharing.

Uber 

""It is an illegal taxi service that should be banned in this state as it has been in many cities and states of the world,"" he said.

Data supplied to Money by Uber shows that about 30 per cent of Victorian taxi plate holders actually drive their own taxi, the rest are owned by a few big investors, some of whom hold hundreds of licences.

In NSW about one-quarter of taxi plate holders actually operate their taxi, almost half are held by those who own more than one and some investors hold over 300.

The Uber spokesperson said the time has come for political leaders to implement sensible, safety-based ride-sharing regulation as quickly as possible.

No one had ever completed the competition's third stage to reach the fourth and final stage—a 75-foot rope climb—until both Caldiero and fellow competitor Geoff Britten did so in yesterday's Las Vegas finale, according to the  Denver Post . Both men actually bested the fourth stage, but Caldiero did it three seconds quicker to claim the $1 million prize.

5754,"U.S. wheat futures climbed to a one-month high on Thursday, rising for four out of five sessions, underpinned by adverse weather in Australia and the Black Sea region. Soybeans edged higher on Chinese purchases, although gains were capped by abundant supplies from freshly harvested crops in the U.S. Midwest. Corn dipped after closing the last session 0.7-percent higher. 
 
Dry weather is threatening the 2016 grain harvests in Ukraine and Russia, both major Black Sea wheat exporters which are currently sowing winter crops, analysts and forecasters say. There was talk of frost damage to the Australian crop, but traders and analysts said on Thursday that it had avoided widespread production losses. “There is upside potential for wheat because of dry weather in the Black Sea region,” said Kaname Gokon of brokerage Okato Shoji in Tokyo. “Demand for U.S. wheat could increase if dry weather reduces production in Russia and Ukraine.” Chicago Board Of Trade December wheat rose as much as 0.3 percent to $5.09 a bushel, the highest since Aug. 25. The contract was trading up 0.1 percent at $5.07-3/4 by 0245 GMT. 
 
November soybeans gained 0.1 percent to $8.64-1/2 a bushel, while December corn eased 0.1 percent to $3.82-3/4 a bushel. Export demand for U.S. wheat has been sluggish due to competition for business from other countries offering cheaper supplies. 
 
Demand from China helped put a floor under the soybean market which slid to 6-1/2 year low this week. Private exporters struck deals to sell 284,500 tonnes of U.S. soybeans to China, the world’s top importer of the oilseed, during the marketing year that began on Sept. 1, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. China will purchase millions of tonnes of the oilseed from the United States during President Xi Jinping’s visit to the country next week, industry sources said. For corn, there are concerns about a fungal disease in the U.S. Midwest. 
 
A tropical storm could have carried the corn disease tar spot into the heart of the U.S. farm belt for the first time, as winds and rain blew in from Latin America, researchers told Reuters. The USDA has confirmed cases of tar spot in four locations in Indiana and three in Illinois. The fungal disease has been a problem for years in Mexico and in Central and South America, with farmers fighting infections that can lower yields.

The Internet of Things is in the early stages of mainstream deployment but it promises to unlock value and rapidly transform how organizations manage, operationalize, and monetize their assets. IoT is a complex structure of hardware, sensors, applications, analytics and devices that need to be able to communicate geographically and across all functions. Once the data is collected from numerous endpoints, the challenge then becomes converting it into actionable insight.

6394,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  September 9, 2015  Margaret Dore Contact: Margaret Dore at: 206-697-1217
Sacramento, CA – In light of today’s narrow passage of assisted suicide legislation by the California State Assembly, a national expert on assisted suicide and euthanasia points out a fundamental flaw with today’s floor debate. “The assemblymembers didn’t focus on the bill’s language,” said Margaret Dore, president of Choice is an Illusion, regarding ABX2-15, which is modeled on similar laws in Oregon and Washington State. ""The bill is sold as giving people choice and control at the end of life. Yet the bill’s language is stacked against the patient and applies to people with years, even decades, to live.”  “The bill applies to people with a ‘terminal disease,’ which is defined as having less than six months to live. Most people thinks this means ‘dying,’” Dore said. ""However, in Oregon, which uses a nearly-identical definition of terminal disease, an 18-year-old with insulin-dependent diabetes is ‘eligible’ for assisted suicide. Doctors are often wrong at predicting life expectancy. Sadly, this bill encourages people with years, even decades, to live to throw away their lives.”  “In my law practice, I started out working in guardianships, wills and probate, and saw abuse of all kinds, especially where there was money involved (where there's a will, there are heirs),” Dore explained. “The California bill sets up the perfect crime: your heir can actively participate in signing you up for the lethal dose and once the lethal dose is in the home, there’s no oversight --not even a witness is required. If you resisted or struggled, who would know?""
“The Assembly got caught up in the concept of the bill, when the devil was in the details of the bill text,” Dore said. “Hopefully, when it goes to the Senate, there will be a closer examination of the text and the raft of problems in the bill.""  Governor Brown should ready his veto pen for this deceptive legislation.

277,"::Momma Disclosure::  Labor Day weekend was kicked off with some good family fun! If you have kids you have been to some version of a pizza and games place. As adults, I like to go where I can enjoy the games or rides with my kids and eat well. Which is why we really like visiting IT'Z their buffet is large and has a good selection of food, and it's not all pizza. The games, I feel, are very well-rounded and have more of an indoor amusement park type feel. So much that; my Santi was finally tall enough to enjoy his first time on the bumper cars and his first time on a roller coaster! As, I died slowly watching him from below. I am not one to get in on the action, I can't. He was so brave, him and my Sister-in-Law got on the wild ride. And, I survived. He did amazing. He loved it.  Mean while Camila enjoyed all the rides and games she was tall enough to ride. The #SummerSizzle event was a good deal for a big family like us. It was the best way for us to start our weekend off. The kids of course always have fun and were so tired they knocked out as soon as we got home. Always good for this Momma.  Our visit to IT'Z set the mood for the rest of the weekend. Which was to be adventurous and keep going! Which we did all weekend long.  What about you, how did you enjoy your Labor Day weekend?",4edecd66-65c3-4cae-ba9b-f54b341afd88,Blog,2015-09-11T01:24:12Z,Momma of Dos,IT'Z ::Visit Recap::,1.0,News

4376,"September 25, 20150 University Departments Sponsor Key BDS AdvocatesUni­ver­sity depart­ments on five dif­fer­ent col­lege cam­puses have spon­sored or co-sponsored anti-Israel pro­grams pro­mot­ing Boy­cott, Divest­ment, and Sanc­tions (BDS) cam­paigns so far dur­ing the 2015–16 aca­d­e­mic year. The found­ing goals of the BDS move­ment and many of the strate­gies employed in BDS cam­paigns are anti-Semitic.  Such spon­sor­ship cre­ates the per­cep­tion that spe­cific uni­ver­sity depart­ments sanc­tion these goals and strate­gies, lend­ing an added degree of legit­i­macy and cred­i­bil­ity to anti-Israel advo­cacy and cam­paigns that may alien­ate Jew­ish and pro-Israel students. Since the 2012–13 aca­d­e­mic year, there have been at least 99 anti-Israel events that received uni­ver­sity depart­ment spon­sor­ship, includ­ing 44 events which took place in the 2014–15 aca­d­e­mic year. On Sep­tem­ber 18, 2015, Omar Bargh­outi, a found­ing mem­ber of the Pales­tin­ian Cam­paign for the Aca­d­e­mic and Cul­tural Boy­cott of Israel (PACBI), spoke at the Uni­ver­sity of California-Berkeley. His pre­sen­ta­tion, which dis­cussed the role which he believes acad­e­mia should play in BDS, was spon­sored by the cam­pus Stu­dents for Jus­tice in Pales­tine (SJP) chap­ter and co-sponsored by eight dif­fer­ent Uni­ver­sity depart­ments, includ­ing the Cen­ter for Race and Gen­der, Asian Amer­i­can Stud­ies, Native Amer­i­can Stud­ies, Eth­nic Stud­ies, Eng­lish, Chi­cano Stud­ies, Near East­ern Stud­ies, and African Amer­i­can Studies. Bargh­outi, a founder of the move­ment who recently stated that he believes BDS is turn­ing main­stream, has used Holo­caust imagery to con­demn Israel and its sup­port­ers in past pre­sen­ta­tions and inter­views. He also has advo­cated for a one-state solu­tion to the Israeli-Palestinian con­flict, along with the right of return for Pales­tin­ian refugees, claim­ing that one state would mean “equal­ity for everyone–irrespective of iden­tity, eth­nic­ity, reli­gion or any other attribute.” Barghouti’s event is not unique for this year though, as the Cen­ter for Diver­sity and Inclu­sion at Michi­gan Tech­no­log­i­cal Uni­ver­sity spon­sored a sim­i­lar pre­sen­ta­tion from Israeli anti-Zionist author Miko Peled on Sep­tem­ber 15, 2015. Over the years, Peled has made sev­eral state­ments about Jews, Israel, and the Israeli-Palestinian con­flict that would not define “inclu­sion” or “diver­sity.” These state­ments include his alle­ga­tion that Israel turned Gaza into an “enor­mous con­cen­tra­tion camp” or more recently, when he stated that “nei­ther Iran, Hezbol­lah or Hamas pose a threat to Israel, they pose a threat to the Israeli occu­pa­tion and oppres­sion of Palestinians.” Other events which received depart­ment spon­sor­ship this year include an upcom­ing per­for­mance by Remi Kanazi, an Orga­niz­ing Com­mit­tee mem­ber of the US Cam­paign for the Aca­d­e­mic & Cul­tural Boy­cott of Israel (USACBI), at John Jay Col­lege. At John Jay, Kanazi’s per­for­mance is being co-sponsored by the Depart­ment of Gen­der Studies. In addi­tion, a Sep­tem­ber 16 pre­sen­ta­tion at Drew Uni­ver­sity by Bassem Tamimi, a Pales­tin­ian anti-Israel activist who has been arrested in Israel sev­eral times, was co-sponsored by the Mid­dle East Stud­ies Depart­ment; and a pre­sen­ta­tion from Vijay Prashad, the for­mer Edward Said chair in Amer­i­can Stud­ies at the Amer­i­can Uni­ver­sity of Beirut, was co-sponsored by the Ethics, Peace, and Global Affairs Program. While not all advo­cates of BDS are anti-Semitic and may be dri­ven by per­ceived legit­i­mate crit­i­cism of cer­tain Israeli poli­cies toward Pales­tini­ans, many indi­vid­u­als engaged in BDS cam­paigns are dri­ven by oppo­si­tion to Israel’s very exis­tence as a Jew­ish state. Because of this, it’s unfor­tu­nate that uni­ver­sity depart­ments would lend their spon­sor­ship to events that can cre­ate an envi­ron­ment that is hos­tile to Jew­ish and pro-Israel students.",b41fc4fd-52e6-4d75-b0b6-ef2b4c2f0bf5,Blog,2015-09-25T20:20:17Z,ADL Blogs,University Departments Sponsor Key BDS Advocates,1.0,Blog

1503,"OTTAWA — The independent watchdog who enforces Canada's election laws says there's nothing wrong with the Conservative party employing the services of controversial Australian campaign fixer Lynton Crosby. 
 

                            The Canada Elections Act specifies that it is illegal for anyone who is not a Canadian citizen or permanent resident to ""in any way induce electors"" to vote or refrain from voting for a particular candidate. 
 

                            But a spokeswoman for the commissioner of elections says providing advice to a campaign or working for a campaign is not considered inducement. 
 

                            The Conservatives confirmed Thursday that Crosby has been helping Stephen Harper's campaign team since March — primarily doing analysis of polling data — and continues to do so. 
 

                            Lynton has been dubbed the ""Wizard of Oz"" for his role masterminding four consecutive election victories for former Australian prime minister John Howard and British Prime Minister David Cameron's re-election earlier this year. 
 

                            But he's also been described in less flattering terms as ""a master of the dark political arts"" and the ""master of dog-whistle politics"" — a reputation New Democrats are using to try to scare up donations to their party. 
 

                            In a fundraising email blast to supporters Friday, the NDP referred to Crosby as an ""evil genius"" and ""an ultra-right-wing political strategist from Australia."" 
 

                            ""He has a long record of helping Conservatives win around the world and now he's set his sights on our election. The Conservatives really will do anything to win — we can't let them,"" says the email. 
 

                            ""Stephen Harper's friends have played dirty in each of the last three elections. This one will be no exception."" 
 

                            Greg Barns, an Australian lawyer and political commentator, agreed with that assessment. 
 

                            Employing Crosby ""shows Harper is desperate,"" Barns said in an email to The Canadian Press. ""Why? Because Crosby has one strategy only and it is scare campaigns. Appeals to insecure voters on issues like race."" 
 

                            Barns predicted Crosby will try to paint NDP Leader Tom Mulcair and Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau as ""soft on migration and crime."" 
 

                            Crosby could not be reached for comment. 
 

                            Duff Conacher, co-founder of Democracy Watch, blasted the elections commissioner for ""choosing not to enforce the federal elections law by ignoring the intention and spirit of measures in the law."" The section of the law barring foreign involvement is titled ""non-interference by foreigners"" and explicitly says a foreigner may not ""in any way"" try to influence voters, he noted. 
 

                            But Conservative incumbent Jacques Gourde said there's nothing unusual in hiring the services of an outside adviser. 
 

                            ""When we're talking about political mechanics of elections, it's international now,"" Gourde said in Victoriaville, Que., where Harper had a campaign event Friday. 
 

                            ""There are advisers everywhere in the world that give advice to many people. Advice is never unwelcome, and it would be applied by people in Canada. 
 

                            Indeed, Harper's Conservatives have been tapping the wisdom of John Howard's Australian strategists since at least 2006. 
 

                            Both the NDP and the Liberals have sought advice in the past from U.S. President Barack Obama's strategists.

In his submission to an inquiry into proposed legislation no longer requiring foreign ships to pay Australian wages between domestic ports, the chairman of the Intercontinental Shipping Group urges the coalition to scrap the bill. 

""As a long-time member of the Liberal Party (nearly 50 years), I am aware that the focus of coalition policy is jobs and growth.

He was enormously efficient, used coupons, and made a game out of how much he could save each week. One of the many unsettling moments in the weeks after he died was my going to Wegmans and realizing I had no idea where to find lentils.

Here in Seattle daughter Sara, who travels a lot, gets much of her grocery order delivered by Amazon. That's true of a lot of the young people who live in my building as well.

The internet was left suitably impressed by his exploits and the stats when spelt out are just ridiculous.

Mr. Snyder told reporters that, while no solution to the impasse has been reached, “we continue to have constructive meetings” and that “more positive progress is going on.” According to MIRS News, the leaders are working off of a basic framework that consists of an annual 1.2 billion-dollar package with two thirds of it coming from “new revenue.” Lawmakers want to reach a road funding deal before the Holidays.",9901c11d-0363-41ac-8408-abb035e0a54d,News,2015-09-25T16:57:58Z,92.9 WLMI,"Governor, ""Quadrant"" Express Optimism About State Road Funding Deal",0.0,Blog

Today the Queen notches up a significant milestone in her reign, breaking the record for the British monarch who's spent the longest time on the throne. 
 
But she's still got some way to go, to be the world's longest-reigning monarch. 
 
63 years and 217 days ago Queen Elizabeth II ascended to the throne after the death of her father, King George XI. 
 
She was just 27 years old. 
 
Today, aged 89, she will surpass her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria as Britain's longest-reigning monarch. 
 
As far as New Zealand goes Elizabeth has already hit that record because Victoria didn't start reigning over us until the Treaty of Waitangi was signed, three years into her rule. 
 
But she still trails behind 47 other international kings and queens when it comes to retaining a crown. 
 
The longest-reigning monarch Sobhuza II of Swaziland ruled for 82 years. 
 
Next in line is Bernhard VII, who ruled the historic German state of Lippe for 81 years in the 15th and 16th centuries. 
 
In Europe, the French are also streaks ahead, with 18th-century Sun King Louis XIV at a lengthy 72 years and three months. 
 
Our Governor General is praising Queen Elizabeth's commitment to her people, as she becomes the longest-reigning British monarch. 
 
The 89 year old will today take the title from her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria. 
 
Sir Jerry Mateparae said it is a remarkable feat, which reflects the promise she made at her coronation - to serve her country to the best of her ability. 
 
Post World War II, it was a time of huge social change around the globe. 
 
""From empire to commonwealth, she has observed, participated [in] and guided that. 
 
""So I think in many ways she has been right at the centre of democracy."" 
 
Sir Jerry has marvelled at Queen Elizabeth's ability to promote independence, while maintaining unity in her realm. 
 
""She has been the person who has helped to guide nations into full independence on the one hand, but also to hold together such an eclectic group of countries."" 
 
Sir Jerry says those countries range from as far afield as the Caribbean and Africa, to Australia and New Zealand. 
 
An investiture ceremony will be held at Government House today, for those New Zealanders who received Queen's Birthday Honours. 
 
There will also be a dinner tonight where, among other things, Sir Jerry says they will mark 40 years of the Queen's Service Order medal in New Zealand. 
 
Sir Jerry said her majesty wanted to keep celebrations of the milestone reasonably low key. 
 
But he anticipates there will be more of a celebration next year, for her 90th birthday.",8379c06c-fd10-4402-a1f9-d0167c90d2db,News,2015-09-08T19:01:45Z,Newstalk ZB,Queen breaks British royalty record,0.0,News
6423,"STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 

Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. ( HOT ) today announced       that it has agreed to sell The Westin Excelsior Rome to Katara       Hospitality for €222 million ($251 million in USD). 
 
As part of the deal, the historic hotel will be renovated in the next       five years, including a top-to-bottom transformation of all guestrooms,       as well as upgrades to the hotel’s public areas. Additionally, as has       been the case with other sales of Starwood hotel assets, it will       continue to be operated by Starwood under a new long-term management       agreement. 
 
Adam Aron, CEO of Starwood on an interim basis, said: “On the heels of       our recent high-profile sales of The Phoenician and The Gritti Palace,       along with other hotel asset transactions, the sale of the Westin       Excelsior Rome brings us to $817 million of hotel assets sold so far       this year. Accordingly, Starwood has now exceeded our stated goal of       completing at least $800 million in hotel asset sales by the end of       2015.” 
 
Simon Turner, President of Global Development, Starwood, added: “We       continue to see strong interest in our remaining owned hotels from a       broad array of high-quality investors from around the world as we look       for the right sale opportunities and long-term partners to create value       for our shareholders.” 
 
“This agreement marks our third property in Italy. The Westin Excelsior       Rome is the epitome of what Katara Hospitality looks for in a hotel,”       said Sheikh Nawaf Bin Jassim Bin Jabor Al-Thani, Chairman of Katara       Hospitality. He continued, “Its grand and statuesque appearance is the       ultimate in luxurious hospitality. The hotel is a welcome addition to       our growing global portfolio of iconic properties, and we are delighted       to be continuing to set the standard for luxury hospitality the world       over.” 
 
Opened in 1906, The Westin Excelsior Rome boasts a premium location on       Via Veneto, one of Rome’s most celebrated streets. Nestled between the       Spanish Steps and the Borghese Gardens & Gallery, the award-winning,       316-room hotel is adjacent to the American Embassy and close to all of       Rome’s leading attractions, including the Colosseum, the Pantheon and       the Sistine Chapel. Hotel amenities include two restaurants and a bar, a       WestinWORKOUT® Fitness Studio, Kami Wellness Center, an indoor pool and       a 24-hour business center. With 14,000 square feet of elegant meeting       space, The Westin Excelsior Rome is a leading venue for wedding       banquets, government delegations and meetings. 
 
Hamad Abdulla Al-Mulla, Chief Executive Officer of Katara Hospitality,       said: “For more than a century, this legendary hotel has provided       exceptional hospitality and hosted dignitaries and celebrities, as well       as business and leisure travelers. We look forward to making further       improvements to The Westin Excelsior Rome and continuing its       long-standing tradition of excellence.” 
 
Michael Wale, President, Starwood Hotels & Resorts, Europe, Africa, and       Middle East, concluded: “We are thrilled to expand our relationship with       Katara Hospitality, owner of both Sheraton Doha Resort & Convention       Center and The Excelsior Hotel Gallia, a Luxury Collection Hotel in       Milan. We look forward to working together on the continued success of       The Westin Excelsior, an architecturally stunning property and one of       the most iconic hotels in Rome.” 
 
The transaction increases Katara Hospitality’s portfolio to 35       properties in operation or under development and marks its third owned       hotel in Italy.

Lucknow, Sept. 17 -- A day after union HRD minister Smriti Irani assured agitating shiksha mitras in Uttar Pradesh (UP) of her 'cooperation', UP BJP chief Laxmikant Bajpai summoned Jitendra Shahi, the state chief of Shiksha Mitra Association to reiterate the party's support to them. The shiksha mitras were appointed during the tenure of BJP government headed by Kalyan Singh in 1999. After his meeting with Shahi, Bajpai announced the party would support any move that the state government initiated for their regularisation.

  VOLL v Villanova (5 SEP 15) - Highlights 


Box Score | Season Stats 

  DENVER - The University of Denver volleyball defeated Villanova 3-1 (20-25, 25-18, 25-18, 25-19) Saturday to win the 2015 Pioneer Classic. The Pioneers went 3-0 in the tournament held in Hamilton Gymnasium and are 5-1 on the season. 

""Well, we're happy as always to get a win,"" head coach Jesse Mahoney said. ""We're struggling to come out of the gate playing well, and we didn't do that in that first set, although I thought Villanova played really well. But we righted the ship and definitely were firing on all cylinders by the final set."" 

Pioneer Classic MVP Cassie Baird (Indianapolis, Ind.) capped off a stellar tournament, serving a career-high four aces in the match. 

""I thought I had a pretty good weekend,"" Baird said. ""I didn't expect this award at all to be honest, but I think overall the team was very good, tonight especially. We were on fire, and that is what was important."" 

All-Tournament team member Kayla Principato (Rockville Centre, N.Y.) led the Pioneers with a career-high 15 kills in their final match of the Pioneer Classic. Nola Basey (Lyons, Colo.) notched a season-high 11 kills and Ruth Okoye (Aurora, Colo.) added 10 kills to the Denver total. Blocker Sarah Schmid (Highlands Ranch, Colo.) led the team with five blocks and hit .500 in the match. 

Splitting the setting duties once again, Piyusha Boteju (Euless, Texas) dished out 26 assists, while Monique Domme (Colorado Springs, Colo.) recorded 19 in the match and was named to the All-Tournament team. Denver stepped up defensively, with four players earning 10 or more digs in the match. 

Villanova came out sharp against Denver, holding the Pioneers to a .077 hitting percentage. Principato and Schmid each recorded three kills and three blocks in the first set as the leaders for the Pioneers. The Wildcats' Claire Crutchfield hit .625 with six kills, making up the difference between the offenses; Villanova had 17 kills to Denver's 11. 

Denver battled back in the second set to win 25-18. The Wildcats earned the first three points, but a kill by Baird put the Pioneers up 15-14 in the set and sparked a 5-1 run by Denver. DU hit .577 in the second set, with four players earning at least three kills in the set and six fewer attacking errors than the first set. 

For the second straight set, Denver won 25-18. Principato and Baird led the Pioneers with four kills apiece in the set. Baird also tallied two service aces to help the Pioneers out to their lead. Piyusha Boteju earned nine assists in the set as the offense found its stride once again. 

In the final set, the Pioneers outlasted the Wildcats, capitalizing on seven attacking errors by Villanova. Basey and Principato each recorded four kills, while Baird notched two aces for the second straight set. DU closed out the set on a 6-0 run to win the fourth set 25-19. 

Overall, the Mahoney and Baird agree the tournament was a learning experience for the Pioneers, as the young squad is still getting used to playing together. In every match, Denver faced challenging opponents and had to fight for the victory. 

""I saw that we can be really good, and we can be really average,"" Mahoney said. ""The goods outweigh the average enough for us to get wins, but to do what we want to do this season, we're going to have to get better. I was proud of my team. We fought back, in every match we had to fight back. But we've got to get better to achieve the goals we want to achieve."" 

""I'm expecting great things from the team,"" Baird said. ""Once we all get used to everything, we're going to be a very good team."" 

The Pioneers will have one more challenge tomorrow as they take on Western Michigan at 2 p.m. MT in a match televised on Altitude 2.

3620,Memories from when I was a little girl have stayed strong when it comes to my house decorated at Christmas.  My Mom was very crafty and she didnt  leave one space not sparkled with Christmas.  I remember sitting in our living room with all the room lights off and just the Christmas lights on.  It was so magical to me. It takes a while for me to get all decorated but then it is so nice to turn off the lights and just sit with all the Christmas lights on. This is a favorite of mine.  Saw this tree many years ago in a Pottery Barn magazine.  Stole the idea and have loved it every year.  Filled with photos of our families memories from the year.  Santa is one of our latest additions.  He is the cutest thing ever and makes me so happy walking by him. We have a few nativities but I love the placement of this one.  When you walk in you can see the bright light shinning on it.  We are ready to enjoy the Christmas season.,00c15943-786e-45ae-bf69-f516eaa72759,Blog,2015-09-16T01:10:00Z,The Roberts Family,Christmas Ready,1.0,Blog

Former Australia captain Michael Clarke believes that Steve Smith’s batting won’t be affected by his elevation to the top job, and insisted that the newly-appointed Test skipper has been handed the reins at the best possible time. 

Smith will oversee a new-look Australian team in the upcoming two-Test series in Bangladesh after Ashes squad members Clarke, Brad Haddin, Chris Rogers, Ryan Harris and Shane Watson recently announced their retirements. 

However, Clarke said Smith’s outstanding form — of which the recent highlight was the 215 he scored during the Lord’s Test against England — will ensure that he is in the perfect frame to assume the captaincy. 

“I think the positive for Smithy is he’s at the top of his game right now and that’s probably the best time to take over the captaincy. He’s comfortable with his batting and how he’s going about it,” said Clarke.

THE Interview, a movie starring James Franco and Seth Rogen as goofballs that clearly draws on stereotypes about North Korea, is currently circulating in Nigeria and the North Korean authorities wants the National Film and Video Censors Board (NFVCB) to discourage further illegal circulation of the film in the country. They complain that the film is in bad taste and that it promotes terrorism. 
 
In the film that was produced in the mould of the 1988 feature The Naked Gun in which Leslie Nielsen gets in a brawl with the Ayatollah Khomeini, Mikhail Gorbachev, Yasser Arafat, Moammar Gaddafi, Fidel Castro and Idi Amin, a TV host and his producer secure an interview with the leader of North Korea – only to find themselves hired by the CIA to assassinate him. 
 
The North Korean authorities have since lodged a formal complaint to the United Nations where they decried the distasteful nature of the film. They feel strongly that to allow the production and distribution of such a film on the assassination of an incumbent head of a sovereign state should be regarded as the most undisguised sponsoring of terrorism as well as an act of war. 
 
The North Korean Ambassador to Nigeria Mr. Jong Choi had previously lodged compliant with the National Film and Video Censors Board (NFVCB) over the illegal distribution of a film which it regards as provocative and targeted at inciting the assassination of the North Korean supreme leader, Kim Jong-Il. Choi who recently paid a courtesy call to the Board expressed displeasure with the movie, which, according to him, not only misrepresents the strides and developments achieved by his country, but also seeks to portray and instigate negative global opinion against the leadership of the DPRK. 
 
The Ambassador pleaded with the NFVCB to initiate action to mop the movie out of the Nigerian market and also cut the supply source. He revealed that a formal complaint had earlier been lodged at the Nigeria Police headquarters over the issue. He underscored the long-standing friendly relations between Nigeria and North Korea and emphasized the need to deepen existing ties. 
 
In her response, the Director General of the Board, Ms Patricia Bala, informed the Ambassador that as a regulator, the agency had carried out due diligence in investigating the matter and established that the movie in question was never submitted to be considered for distribution in Nigeria and that its illegal sale was within underground markets in breach of the law. 
 
Ms Bala stressed that the rules and regulations guiding the distribution and exhibition of movies in the country frown at any content capable of causing a breach of public order or subjecting any individual or nation to ridicule. She assured the North Korean envoy that the agency had already swung into action against the illegal distribution of the said movie, adding that the monitoring and enforcement operatives of the Board were under clear directives to track and bring those involved to face the full weight of the law.

NEW YORK – On high alert after a day of upsets during which Serena Williams was sent packing from the US Open, Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer made sure their names were not added to the list of shocks on Friday as they posted emphatic semi-final victories. 

The tremors started early at Arthur Ashe Stadium with Flavia Pennetta crushing second seed Simona Halep 6-1 6-3, before Roberta Vinci rocked Flushing Meadows delivering one of the biggest upsets in tennis history with her semi-final win over Williams that punctured the American's calendar Grand Slam dream. 

Two victories from becoming the fourth woman to win all four majors in one year, a brittle-looking Williams crumbled as unseeded Vinci, playing in her first grand slam singles semi-final, battled to an improbable 2-6 6-4 6-4 win. 

The results set the stage for an equally improbable all-Italian final on Saturday. 

“I don’t want to talk about how disappointing it is for me,” a grim-faced Williams told reporters. “I told you guys I don't feel pressure. I never felt pressure. 

“I never felt that pressure to win here. I said that from the beginning.” 

With the National Tennis Center buzzing over the exit of Williams, world number one Djokovic and second seed Federer restored order to the year’s final grand slam. 

Djokovic needed just 85 minutes to secure passage to his fourth consecutive grand slam final, crushing defending US Open champion Marin Cilic 6-0 6-1 6-2. 

The demolition was the worst ever in a US Open semi-final, the three games lost one fewer than the four Yevgeny Kafelnikov managed against Lleyton Hewitt in 2001. 

Federer, a five-times US Open winner, was equally efficient as he beat Swiss compatriot Stan Wawrinka 6-4 6-3 6-1. 

The all-time grand slam singles king with 17 titles, Federer heads into Sunday’s final gunning to add to his record haul. He has not won a grand since 2012 Wimbledon. 

The final will mark the 42nd meeting between the two great rivals, with Federer holding a wafer 21-20 advantage. 

“Novak it’s been more straightforward, my opinion,” said Federer. “That’s what I like about the rivalry. 

“I think it’s just a straight shootout and I think that’s the cool thing about our rivalry. It’s very athletic. 

“We both can handle ... whatever we present to one another, and I think our matches, it’s very even.” 

VINCI 300-1 SHOT 

Vinci, a 300-1 shot to win the US Open when the tournament began, pulled off one of the most remarkable ever tennis upsets by ending Williams’ streak of 33 consecutive match wins in the grand slams. 

A five-times doubles grand slam winner, the 32-year-old Vinci had never been beyond the quarter-finals in singles play at 43 majors. 

In the other corner stood Williams, a 21-times grand slam champion who had lost only two matches all season and had not dropped a set against Vinci in their four previous meetings. 

Forced to wait a day after rain wiped out Thursday’s semi-finals schedule, the weight of expectation appeared to take its toll on a 33-year-old who was chasing the first calendar Grand Slam since Steffi Graf in 1988. 

Everything was going according to script as Williams easily took the opening set but things began to unravel after a composed Vinci registered a key break in the fifth game of the second that allowed her to even the match. 

With the contest slipping away, Williams tried to will herself back into the match, screaming and fist-pumping after each point and feeding off the support of the crowd. 

But with nothing lose, an undaunted Vinci continued to pressure Williams, who could not match previous great escapes. 

While a stunned Vinci celebrated, a scowling Williams quickly departed a stunned stadium. 

“This is an incredible moment for me,” Vinci said. “It’s amazing. It’s like a dream. I’m in the final. I beat Serena.” 

Lost in the drama of the Williams match was a brilliant performance by Pennetta, who needed less than an hour to deal with Romanian Halep. 

Pennetta, was a clear underdog but the 26th seed tapped into her vast experience and was not overwhelmed on the big stage. 

She had reached the quarter-finals at Flushing Meadows in six of the previous seven years, but the final will be uncharted territory.",2d752b63-be1a-469d-8f2e-9d450ded23a0,News,2015-09-12T07:47:52Z,Eye Witness News,"Williams exit has Djokovic, Federer on high alert",0.0,News

2985,"WOODBRIDGE, N.J. , Sept. 15, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and its international counterpart, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) , are expected to release their final respective versions of the Lease Accounting Standards by the end of 2015, with implementation required by 2017-2018.  The IASB is expected to release soon, and the US Board is expected to follow suit by the end of this year.  The Standard requires lessees to record all real estate and equipment leases of more than one year on the balance sheet as liabilities, with corresponding assets called ""Right of Use"" (ROU) assets.  The impact of this accounting standard change will have a profound impact on a company's capital structure, leasing practices and operational processes. In fact, it has been estimated that the accounting change will add $1.35+ trillion of assets and liabilities to company balance sheets. 

The new standard will require significant work for US corporations and any entity reporting on a GAAP basis.  All leases will have to be analyzed to determine their current ROU and liability values, and such calculations will have to go back three years to stay compliant with Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations.  Interestingly, in a recently published survey by IBM, 92% of companies surveyed indicated that they were not prepared to implement the Standard, either in terms of lease information systems, employee training or leasing practices and policies. 
   
""This is a fundamental shift in how we account for real estate assets.  Although the exact details of the lease accounting standard changes are yet to be seen in their final form, most of the elements have now been defined, and companies already should be collecting the data needed to generate the required entries.  With everything that needs to be done, companies that wait until the last minute will certainly regret not acting sooner,"" says Michael Bell , Senior Advisor at Visual Lease.  See Visual Lease's whitepaper, "" The Lease Accounting Tsunami; Are You Prepared to Weather the Storm? "" 

According to Michael, some of questions you should be asking now to get prepared for the transition include: 
How does the new standard affect the current lease portfolio?  Specifically, what is the total asset value (ROU) and liability value after recalculating the company's lease portfolio? How will these new values affect the company's key financial indicators such as ROA (return on assets), debt to equity ratio, and related taxes? How should future lease/buy decisions change in light of the new standard? What portion of the lease portfolio will be impacted by the international standards, which differ slightly from the US FASB standard?   What data elements and system enhancements are needed to the company's lease management system, lease accounting processes and personnel training to comply with the new standard?   
""In order to ensure that our clients have the most up-to-date analytical capabilities, Visual Lease's FASB functionality will capture all of the needed data elements and perform all the required analyses.  In fact, we built this two years ago when FASB issued its first Exposure Draft, but put further development on hold because FASB was not clear on its final direction,"" says Derek Anderson , Managing Director of Visual Lease.  ""Now that FASB is close to issuing the Standard, we are completing our development work.  But for us, not only must it work properly, it has to be as easy to use as the rest of the system.  We know that simplicity and clarity are two of Visual Lease's most important differentiators.  The FASB changes can be no different.  Visual Lease's FASB functionality will be clean, easy and effective.""  

The new FASB lease accounting changes in Visual Lease will include: 
Identification of the financial impact of the changes on the portfolio Automated identification of Type A and Type B leases Portfolio reporting under both FASB and IASB rules Automation of the generation of ROU and liability entries for the general ledger 
Additionally, Visual Lease will work with its clients to help them identify the impact of the changes as well as strategies for mitigation and accommodation.  Marc Betesh , Founder and CEO of Visual Lease, added ""Our 30 years of lease accounting expertise will provide a critical advantage for our clients.  We understand how the new Standard should optimally fold into existing processes, as not only were we direct FASB roundtable participants, but we've been working with lease accounting since well before any of the lease management systems were developed.""

4519,"By BRITAIN EAKIN  
 
ALEXANDRIA, Va. (CN) - Virginia sheriff's officers stormed the home of a severely disabled man, knocked him down and seized his 18-lb. service dog at gunpoint - for leash law violations, the man claims in court. 
     In addition to prostate cancer and degenerative bone disease, William Selepack has gone through hip and shoulder replacement surgeries, removal of his large intestine, removal of several spinal discs, and septum reconstruction. He has balance problems, ""extremely low manual dexterity,"" short- and long-term memory loss and dementia, according to his Sept. 24 lawsuit in Federal Court. 
     Selepack has a doctor's note stating that his disabilities preclude him from using a leash, or from lifting more than 10 pounds. ""Even the slightest tug of a leash would be sufficient to unbalance Mr. Selepack, causing him to fall, or to pull Mr. Selepack to the ground,"" the complaint states. A leash would also create a tripping hazard. 
     But around 9 p.m. on Oct. 1, 2013, five officers with the sheriff's Rapid Response Unit barged into Selepack's home with guns drawn and threw him onto the stairs. 
     ""When Mr. Selepack tried to stand up, he was thrown onto the stairs a second time,"" the complaint states. Officers held him at gunpoint while they searched for and seized Max. 
     Max has been in custody of Loudoun County Animal Control since he was seized, and the county refuses to let Selepack visit him, according to the complaint. Since the county seized Max, Selepack has fallen several times and bruised and broken ribs. One time he lay in the cold for hours because he couldn't get help. He has wandered into traffic, spent hours riding the Metro aimlessly and has gone outside improperly dressed looking for Max. 
     Selepack had had previous run-ins with Animal Control because he did not keep Max on a leash, but controlled him with voice commands. But Loudoun County allows no exceptions to its leash law, which raises its seizure of Max and excessive and unreasonable force against Selepack to constitutional violations, according to the complaint. As a service dog, Max should be exempt from leash laws under the Virginians With Disabilities Act and the Americans With Disabilities Act. 
     Selepack offered documentation of his disabilities to Animal Control, to no avail. In September 2013, a Loudoun County judge found Max a ""public nuisance,"" and ordered him seized, though Max had been trained as a service dog, graduated from obedience school and had no behavioral issues, according to the complaint. Selepack got him in 2005, when Max was 8 weeks old. 
     He sued Loudoun County and three of its Animal Control officers. He names but did not sue five members of the Loudon County Sheriff's Rapid Response Unit who allegedly stormed his house to seize his miniature Doberman Pinscher, Max. 
     Miniature Dobermans are feisty, intelligent little fellows, generally no bigger than a miniature poodle. 
     Selepack's attorney says it's unclear why Animal Control felt it needed the sheriff's help to seize Max. He says Animal Control's response to a FOIA request did not disclose any policies outlining when it would call in the sheriff to execute a search warrant. 
     The sheriff's office did not respond to a request for comment. Nor did Selepack's attorney, Joshua Erlich. 
     Selepack seeks declaratory judgment and punitive damages for illegal search and seizure, excessive force, violations of state and federal disabilities laws, illegal taking, other civil rights violations, and failure to train and supervise. He also wants the county's leash law, or its interpretation of the leash law, enjoined, and attorney's fees and costs of suit. ",6644f2de-0619-42ba-8a5a-5c1ca2a7783e,News,2015-09-29T12:47:09Z,Courthouse News Service,Overkill for Little Max's Leash Law Violations,0.0,Blog

110,"NEW YORK — Time and time again Serena Williams escaped during this Grand Slam season on her quest to sweep all four majors. But finally, on Friday, she hit a roadblock that caused her not just to trip, but to fall.

That hurdle came in the most unlikely of forms in Roberta Vinci, a 32-year-old world No. 43 who was making her debut appearance in a Grand Slam semifinal.

It also came in the form of unthinkable pressure loaded onto the shoulders of the 33-year-old world No. 1, who was trying to sweep all four majors in a calendar year for the first time since 1988, when Steffi Graf did so.

""I don't think we can understand the scale of what she felt,"" said Leif Shiras, a TV commentator for British broadcaster Sky Sports and former player in an interview. ""It's tough to play against history. You have to feel like her loss is a symptom of that pressure.""

Williams swatted away any suggestion that her Friday demise — after 26 Grand Slam match wins this year and 33 dating to Wimbledon last season — was due to expectation of the moment.

""I told you guys I don't feel pressure,"" a tired Williams told reporters in a news conference. ""I never felt pressure. … I never felt that pressure to win here. I said that from the beginning.""

From the beginning of 2015, however, Williams' drive for the Grand Slam has been a fragile, bumpy one. At the French Open she worked through five three-setters, the most of any major in her career; at Wimbledon she trailed Heather Watson by two breaks in the third set in the third round; a week ago Bethanie Mattek-Sands had her on the ropes in a night match.

Each time, a Serena 'W;' but not today.

""Today was not a good day,"" her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, told a small group of reporters, saying Williams woke up feeling off.

""Players are humans,"" he continued. ""How many times did it happen this year where she felt like this and she still found her way through? She didn't find her way today.""

Even Vinci, undone by Williams four times (all in straight sets) coming in, could see the most feared opponent in tennis looking tentative, double faulting, yelling at herself to find a way.

""(In) my mind, I say, 'Think about this, she's nervous,'"" a smiling Vinci said. ""So I tried to keep fighting for every single point.""

""It was apparent to all of us who have watched her for 20 years that she was nervous today,"" Chris Evert said plainly on ESPN.

It was a different kind of match than most of her three-setters at the majors, however. Seven times she had come back from dropping the first set. But only once in a three-set match did she drop the second – as she did Friday – and then right herself.

In the third set against Vinci, Williams appeared lost and at times confounded, however. She barked at herself at one moment, all of Arthur Ashe yelling shouts of encouragement. The next, she was quieting herself — palm towards the ground — trying to stay calm.

""I was just trying to win points at that point and win the match,"" she explained.

One shouldn't underestimate the emotional impact of the Slam, Shiras said.

""The toll of this journey she was on was too much for her today,"" Shiras said. ""She was trying to dig deep and the way to generate energy for her is to get that passion out. But I think that can tire her; there is an element of fatigue that plays into this story. She was at a breaking point; she was boiling. And Vinci was drawing that out of her. It was amazing drama.""

The pressure finally got to Serena Williams and killed her Grand Slam dream

Drama with a twist: On this day, the 21-time major champion, chasing history in front of a home crowd, with more power on her racket than anyone in the game was on the losing end. A defeat with a capital 'D.'

""Every loss is difficult,"" Mouratoglou said. ""I think she lost her way mentally. Tactically she didn't know what to do. When you make the wrong choices, you lose the points you're supposed to win and then you make more and more wrong choices. She lost her way on the path tactically.""

A road that started in Melbourne ends in New York — and not in the way Williams imagined.

3753,"“In some cases these phone lines were burned down before the message was delivered,” he said. 
 
A couple needing help evacuating waited for deputies in a creek near their home. A woman fretted that her mother with Alzheimer’s disease wouldn’t know to leave. 
 
The dispatch logs show deputies racing around winding, single-lane roads in the community and maneuvering past downed power lines to rescue whoever they could. 
 
Martin said his department used social media, door-to-door notifications and reverse 911 calls to tell residents of mandatory evacuation orders but conceded that not everyone received alerts. 
 
Deputies were asked to help enforce mandatory evacuation orders just 30 minutes after the fire started. 
 
Those were just a few of the overwhelming number of calls the tiny Lake County Sheriff’s Department received during the fast-moving blaze that began Sept. 12 about 100 miles north of San Francisco. 
 
The 40 pages of logs involving dispatchers and deputies told the story of the unfolding disaster, detailing the frantic scramble to evacuate people and animals as the fire ripped through miles of dry vegetation. 
 
From a previous fire in late July, he knew to expect a recorded call on his cellphone or look for someone coming through the neighborhood with a bullhorn yelling for people to evacuate. 
 
The records show that some people ignored those orders. In at least two instances, residents threatened or argued with would-be rescuers. 
 
Authorities have since found four bodies in the charred ruins and one person remained missing and feared dead. 
      
 
A daughter was worried about her elderly parents trying to flee a massive California wildfire on horseback. 
 
High school math teacher Bill Davis said last week that he watched from his home as smoke mounted from the fire. 
 
“Try to get them out,” a dispatcher told one deputy who encountered resistance at a house that was on fire. 
 
The fire burned 1,320 homes and is one of the most destructive blazes in California history. 
 
“None of that happened,” he said. His house burned after he finally rounded up his cats and left. 
 
The logs show worried relatives calling often to request checks on elderly and sick residents feared trapped in their homes. Screams for help were reported from residents unable to get out of the fire zone, while other callers pleaded for deputies to rescue livestock and pets left behind. 
 
“The response was as quick as we could do it,” Sheriff Brian Martin said. “In some cases, it didn’t reach everybody.” 
 
Dispatch logs released Thursday showed the small department was strained to its limits by the flames that swept across the mountainous county. 
 
One of the victims was Barbara McWilliams, an elderly woman with multiple sclerosis. The dispatch logs show deputies being asked to check on her at 7:12 p.m. Sept. 12 and reporting back 17 minutes later that the fire blocked their access to her home.

4416,"Australia is to launch another bid for a seat on the United Nations Security Council, just a year after its last term on the Council expired. Australia is to launch another bid for a seat on the United Nations Security Council, just a year after its last term on the Council expired. The spot Australia is seeking will be open in 2029.

The Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop, is expected to make the announcement in her address to the General Assembly on Tuesday evening in New York.

In Opposition the Coalition , which was pursued by the Gillard and Rudd governments, saying it was a waste of money and would risk Australia having to compromise on foreign policy to woo votes, Fairfax Media reported at the time.

The bid cost around $25 million.

But in office the Coalition government effectively used its increased influence at UN to help drive the investigation of the downing of MH17.

""Australia served with distinction throughout our last two-year term, which ended in December 2014. We championed initiatives that directly supported our national security interests, taking the lead on a number of landmark resolutions,"" said Ms Bishop in a statement.

""Australia chaired the Al Qaeda, Taliban and Iran sanctions committees and coordinated the Council's work on Afghanistan. We pressed for a concerted international response to the rise of Da'esh and the threat of foreign terrorist fighters.

""Australia promoted the linkages between human rights protection and political stability and security, including putting the human rights situation in North Korea on the Council's formal agenda.""

Australia won its last rotating seat on the body after an intensive lobbying effort.

The foreign minister at the time, Bob Carr, described it as a ""big, juicy, decisive win"".

The council, charged with maintaining global peace and order, is made up of five permanent members, with veto powers, along with ten non-permanent members.

In July Russia, a permanent member, blocked a proposal supported by Australia to have the Council establish a tribunal to prosecute anyone who might be charged as a result of the investigation into MH17.

Countries normally announce their candidacies years in advance, and the 2029-2030 term is the first available seat that is not already being contested.

This gives Australia the greatest chance of success and minimises the cost.

When it comes to firmware, good things come in pairs this week, it seems! 
 
We've already told you about a pair of upcoming updates from Olympus and Sony earlier in the week. Firstly, Olympus will be updating both the E-M1 and E-M5 II mirrorless cameras in a couple of months, adding a raft of new features to both. And then we have Sony's plans for uncompressed raw support in the Alpha A7S II and A7R II mirrorless cameras , a plan that may possibly spread over time to bring other A7-series firmware updates. 
 
In a typical week, that would be plenty enough for our Firmware Friday roundup, but even having already told you about all of that this week, we're still left with a whole lot to discuss. We have news of updates for two Canon DSLRs, two Nikon DSLRs, two business-oriented Ricoh rugged cameras and an action camera from Chinese brand XiaoYi. 
 
We'll start with Canon, whose updates for the EOS-1D X and EOS-1D C DSLRs landed a couple of days ago. In both cases, the updates fix the exact same issue: The autofocus drive continuing to operate intermittently with a shutter button half-press, even when the custom functions had been set to activate metering only on a half-press. 
 
Canon EOS-1D X owners can download the firmware version 2.0.8 update from Canon's website and install it themselves. Canon EOS-1D C, owners, however, will have to return their camera to Canon to have the firmware version 1.4.0 update installed , and may have to pay for shipping and handling. 
 
Next up, we have Nikon's updates for the D5200 and D7100 DSLRs. Both updates aim to resolve a problem with camera lockup when the ""Clean image sensor"" function has been activated, as well as horizontal banding in HD (1,280 x 720 pixel) movies shot at 50p or 60p frame rates. 
 
For the D7100 only, there are also fixes for a problem with camera lockups during menu scrolling in some languages, as well as an issue that caused the screen to darken during image review if the playback button was pressed. An unspecified problem with the viewfinder virtual horizon has also been corrected. 
 
You can download Nikon's new firmware at the links below: 
 
Next up this week, we have new firmware for the Ricoh G800 and G800SE. These rugged cameras are aimed at business and industrial use, and differ in the latter's Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS and bar code scanning capabilities. (Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are built-in, while the other functions require optional accessories.) 
 
New firmware for the Ricoh G800SE and G800 resolves an issue with connection to PictBridge-compliant printers. For the G800, that's the only change, but the G800SE also gets some other tweaks. A problem that prevented image transfer when using the date folder option has been fixed, and support added for more 802.1x certificates. These include certificates that expire after the year 2038, chained certificates, and PEAP with EAP-MSCHAP v2 certificates (but only with an EAP-TLS certificate key of 2,048 bit or less.) 
 
You can download Ricoh's new firmware at the links below: 
 
And finally, we come to the XiaoYi action camera, for which firmware version 1.2.12 landed earlier this week. Here, there have been tweaks to power-saving mode for greater battery life, and to sounds and status lights for better status indication. Behavior in time-lapse, burst mode and loop video recording has also been changed. Problems with app connectivity and live view have also been fixed, as well as issues with image reversal and clip length in time-lapse shooting. You can download the XiaoYi action camera firmware version 1.2.12 here . 
 
And that brings us to the end of a rather action-packed week on the firmware front. Enjoy your weekend, and be sure to check back next time for more Firmware Friday news!

3161,"I spend a lot of time using must-have apps, editing videos and catching up on other work, which means I spend hours in front of a computer. It also means my wrist, back and eyes can start feeling strained if I’m not sitting properly or optimizing my desk space. It’s so important to treat your body right while in front of a screen. Thanks to the sexy world of ergonomics, we now have the techniques (I’ve talked about proper desk posture here ) and the products that can make your workspace very body-friendly. But because we don’t want to sacrifice style as well, I thought I’d take today to highlight some ways to ergo up your desk top so you can prevent premature tech aches and pains. 
 

 
Laptop Stand – The days of desktop computers as our main squeeze are more scarce than ever. We use our laptops as our everyday computer, which tends to have us staring down at the monitor. That’s no good! A laptop stand like this Elago L3 (or even their L4) is perfect for bringing your monitor up to eye level so your neck gets a break (no pun intended). The L3 is so sleek and minimalistic so it’s barely noticeable underneath your laptop–a feature I love so the desktop can maintain an uncluttered appearance. When you use the stand, just make sure your laptop is set a distance from your eyes that keeps you from leaning into your computer, but also not strain your eyes from being too close. 
 
External Keyboard and Mouse - Again, because the laptop is always by our side, it’s REALLY important to use external devices if you’re in front of your computer for extended hours. Using the built-in trackpad regularly can cause severe cramping. A portable keyboard is necessary when you have your laptop raised to eye level–on a stand your arms won’t be able to maintain a 90 degree angle. A great mouse will hold your hand in a more natural position for long-term use. I’m a big fan of even using a tablet because it can act as a mouse and is excellent for my creative projects. Have a little fun with your keyboard and mouse and add a pop of color like the turquoise Topcase USB mouse or Azio HUE pink keyboard (or this rainbow light one ! WHAT!). You can also go ultra sleek with all white like the Apple Magic mouse . 
 
Desk Lamp - The position of your body and how your hands lay aren’t the only concern with your desk, lighting is important too. Screen brightness and the type of light in your office can really cause eye strain. Add a minimalistic LED light to your desk to brighten up your space and give your eyes a softer, but still brilliant light, to highlight your work. Poppin makes such fun and clean desktop items and their Limber LED Task Lamp is no different. Two tips to keep in mind when adding a lamp: set the height around 15 inches above your desktop to help the light spread evenly across your workspace, and place the lamp on the opposite side of your desk than your dominate hand so you don’t cast shadows every time you place your hand in front of the light. 
 
Chair - Remember how, in my posture article , I talked about the importance of a chair that supports your back and adjusts so your feet can touch the ground? So yeah, that’s vital. It will keep you from overcorrecting your posture, leading to more strain, and eliminate any knee issues. A great chair will actually lift up so you’re close enough to the desk that your arms are at a 90 degree angle for typing, but low enough that alone or with the help of a foot stool your feet are resting flat. I tend to switch from on my bed to a comfy desk chair once I realize I’m going to be on my laptop for a prolonged period. This Malta Office Chair is white and bright and a comfy but professional option for dressing up your desk and pampering your body. 
 
Bonus: If you don’t want to invest in an external mouse or keyboard and/or you do and want added support then think about getting a wrist rest to support your wrist better. It doesn’t hurt that Socksmakeover might possibly sell the CUTEST wrist rests ever. Look at this little kitty rest ! This can most definitely be a personality piece–something to think about when decorating your desk .

2713,"If you go... WHO: The Scorpions with Queensryche 
WHEN: 7 p.m. Sunday 

WHERE: Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion, Gilford 

TICKETS: $24 to $67 

INFO: banknhpavilion.com; 293-4700 

			
			
			
 			
			 
Klaus Meine is one of the most instantly recognizable voices in rock music. 
As lead singer for the German hard-rock band the Scorpions, Meine’s powerful tenor has guided the band through countless power-rock ballads — hit songs like “Rock You Like A Hurricane,” “Wind Of Change,” “Still Loving You” and “Big City Nights.” 

This year, the Scorpions celebrate their 50th anniversary with a new album, “Return To Forever,” and a commemorative world tour, which includes a stop Sunday night at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion in Gilford along with Queensryche. 

Meine talked with NH Weekend recently about the group’s latest album, its longevity and whether they’ll retire anytime soon. 

Happy 50th anniversary to the band. How does it feel to reach such a milestone? 

Yeah, I mean, to put a five in front of the 0, it feels a little bit scary in the first moment. Is it really that long? (Laughs) You join this very exclusive club of legendary artists, from the Stones to the Beach Boys, The Who — there are very few bands that (are) reaching this magic number, and now we’re one of them. You know, it feels great. 

Are you excited about the tour? 

Absolutely. Yeah. Even after all these years — we’ve done it so many times. 

How do you think American audiences compare with the rest of the world? 

Back in the ‘80s, we became very Americanized. It’s still very exciting because this is the old rock ‘n’ roll dream, you know — to play in the free world and to go on tour with a tour bus. 

How do you think the band has sustained itself? 

For us, it was always important to have the right chemistry in the band. And I guess we were lucky. We enjoyed life and we were ready to party every night as well, but yeah, that’s always a fine line. There are a lot of artists from the world of rock ‘n’ roll that really get burned up or didn’t survive this crazy ride, you know? 

Is there any part of recording and touring that still surprises you? 

It’s always exciting to create new pieces of music. How can you ever get tired of this? These days we play in front of three generations pretty much wherever we go, and it’s wonderful to see. 

How is the new album different from previous Scorpions albums? 

It has Scorpions DNA. It’s about heavy riffs, but it’s definitely also about melody. It’s about power rock ballads, you know. But it’s also about those big riffs, like “The Zoo” or “Big City Nights” and “Rock You Like A Hurricane,” all those songs. 

So, looking back on those older songs, how do they seem different to you now? 

It feels great sometimes to go back in time and realize that there’s still some great material we never really focused on or never touched all those years. 

Then of course, the question is: “What the hell? Why didn’t we release those songs back then because they came out so strong?” 

How do you sustain your vocals over such a long period of time? That’s got to be taxing. 

I mean, next to rock ‘n’ roll, discipline is an ugly word. I cannot change the strings like our guitar players if there’s a problem, so you take care that your vocal chords stay intact and powerful. 

Do you and (guitarist and founder) Rudolf Schenker share a special closeness because you’ve both been there since the beginning? 

We were friends. This is how this all started. It was not about having the superstar singer, a superstar guitarist with a super, super-duper ego, so it was all about going together to make this journey a worldwide success. 

Do you think the band will officially retire when this tour is over? 

We don’t make any plans any more. (Laughs.) After 200 concerts between 2010, 2012, we thought this could be, really, the end of the road. And it’s easy to say, ‘We’ll stop at this point,’ but it’s so much harder to do, because it’s so emotional. This is our life, you know. 

I guess when our fans listen to this new album “Return to Forever,” then they’ll know why we couldn’t stop at this point.

3003,"Most of us can only dream about living in a world where we get paid to do what we love, but having an awesome job doesn’t have to be a stretch of the imagination. The following six individuals have made their passions their life, and with a little creativity and a lot of hard work, you can too. 
 
Get inspired and then tell us—if you could make a living in the outdoors, what would you choose to do? 
 
Emily Shanblatt 
 
>> Outdoor Director, French Broad River Academy for Girls 
 
Asheville, N.C. 
 
Chemistry and outdoor leadership. Those were 27-year-old Emily Shanblatt’s two majors when she graduated from Warren Wilson College in western North Carolina. Though Shanblatt did teach chemistry for a year, it was eventually her love of whitewater kayaking that took priority, leading her to the steep creeks of California all the way around the world to the big water of Nepal. 
 
“In college, I discovered a kayak can take you to places you never even imagined,” says Shanblatt, now a sponsored paddler for Confluence. “Your whole world opens up.” 
 
Shanblatt taught women’s kayaking clinics for friend and fellow paddler Anna Levesque’s program Girls At Play, and helped with the French Broad River Academy (FBRA), an Asheville-based middle school for boys specializing in adventure education. Shanblatt’s vision of what she wanted to do with her life was starting to take shape. Conveniently for her, so too was an all-girls version of the French Broad River Academy, which will begin its first year of operation this fall with Shanblatt at the helm as Outdoor Director and math teacher. 
 
“Every Thursday, we don’t step foot in the classroom. We go paddling as much as we can when weather and water levels cooperate,” which, when you’re in the Southeast, is practically year-round. 
 
An all-girls middle school that focuses on whitewater canoeing, of all things, sounds pretty progressive, pretty niche, but Shanblatt’s in charge of 18 girls already, which makes her hopeful for the future of not just the program, but the girls themselves. 
 
“More and more women are running class V and kayaking. The more women these girls can see reaching those higher levels, that’s really powerful,” Shanblatt says. “To give our students an option to explore those things is really valuable. Every girl needs to know that she’s capable of what she wants to do.” 
 

 
Pat Goodman 
 
>> Professional climber 
 
Fayetteville, W.Va. 
 
The view from Pat Goodman’s office is rarely the same, but it’s usually about four inches from his face, hard, and kinda gray. That is, until he turns around and takes in the expanse of remote Canadian (or Chinese or Venezuelan or Indian) backcountry from his perch some 2,000 feet up on a rock face. 
 
“The big appeal [of rock climbing] is getting into a remote location and experiencing an area that few, if any, people have ever visited,” Goodman says. “It’s a pretty surreal experience to go to a place like that.” 
 
Goodman, 37, works hard for those moments. Back in 2012 during his fifth trip to the Vampire Spires in northwestern Canada, Goodman and his team of three navigated 100 miles of the notoriously rowdy Nahanni River by raft just to reach the base of an 800-meter wall, The Phoenix, which was then-unclimbed. And the adventure was only beginning. They then successfully made the first free ascent, tackling an 18-pitch route they later dubbed The Phreenix rated VI 5.11. 
 
As romantic as it sounds, bushwhacking through exotic landscapes and living in a bivy doesn’t necessarily pay the bills. When Goodman’s not racking up first descents, he stays busy with hardwood flooring jobs back at his home in the New River Gorge. 
 
“Maintaining a positive income is definitely a challenge,” Goodman admits, but with a little help from his sponsors Outdoor Research, LaSportiva, Big Agnes, Metolius, Julbo, Probar, and Mountainsmith, Goodman’s able to travel the world on a never-ending quest for the next big ascent. 
 
Aside from The Phreenix, Goodman has been on first ascent teams defying the unlikely close to home and far away, from a V.11 boulder problem in Linville, N.C., called Roadside Distraction, to Daugou Peak in China’s Shuangquiao Valley. 
 
Though he’s experienced cultures and foods, traditions and settings of nearly every variety, his favorite part about his job is simple. 
 
“The climbing. That’s why I do it.” 
 

 
Eva Surls 
 
>> Mountain bike guide and co-owner, The Bike Farm 
 
Brevard, N.C. 
 
Cradled by the lush green expanse of Pisgah National Forest, The Bike Farm sits on 440 acres just outside of Brevard, N.C., a small town with a big reputation as the Cycling Capital of the South. With hundreds of miles of technical singletrack right out her backdoor, and a husband for a coworker, co-owner and guide Eva Surls sometimes has to pinch herself—is this really where she lives, works, and plays? 
 
“I grew up in east Texas in piney woods, kinda like the eastern part of North Carolina actually,” Surls says, “but I fell in love with this area, the water, the green, and I definitely fell in love with the mountain biking here.” 
 
Together, Surls and her husband Cashion Smith started The Bike Farm in the fall of 2012 as “a community-style hub that people could come gather at, ride bikes, and experience nature and healthy living.” In the early stages, however, there was no “farm,” per say. There was just a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter that Surls and Smith lived and guided out of full-time. 
 
“Owning or starting a business is definitely challenging,” Surls says. “You’re married to it. You don’t leave it at the office because your home is the office.” 
 
Still, for Surls, whose family encouraged her to pursue adventure sports at an early age, helping others experience biking is a dream come true. When she isn’t in the saddle guiding women or beginners around Pisgah’s elaborate trail system, she’s donning another hat as marketing director or perhaps event coordinator, maybe business manager—when your business has no full-time staff, you make do. But Surls doesn’t seem to mind, for at the end of the day, her mission with The Bike Farm is simple: get people outside. 
 
“I really believe that part of health is experiencing nature and the future of the planet depends on humans interacting with it and realizing the value in it as its own entity,” she adds. “Guiding was an avenue that I saw to get people out into nature…and also experiencing their own body.” 
 

 
Bryan Mangum 
 
>> Road warrior, Eagles Nest Outfitters 
 
Asheville, N.C. 
 
If you ever meet Bryan Mangum, you’ll likely find him at any of the region’s major music festivals relaxing in a hammock, feet propped up, swaying in time with the music. Add some palm trees and a margarita and that sounds damn near like a vacation, but don’t be fooled—Mangum’s on the clock for Eagles Nest Outfitters, or ENO. His job? Road warrior, a fierce title for someone whose main job responsibilities include setting up hammocks, selling hammocks, and of course, relaxing in hammocks, too. 
 
“The festivals can be anywhere from the Florida Keys all the way up to New York,” Mangum says of his territory. “Some people may only see bands once in their lifetime, where I get to see them sometimes four times throughout a summer.” 
 
Like representing a cool outdoorsy brand and chilling in hammocks all day wasn’t sweet enough, Mangum also gets to see some of his favorite artists perform like Phil Lesh and Friends, Warren Haynes, Widespread Panic, and Slightly Stoopid, just to name a few. 
 
“The music is definitely a perk of the job,” Mangum, 28, says. “An even bigger perk of the job is when your booth is set up in front of the stage.” 
 
Rough life, right? But setting up an armada of hammocks and manning a booth for four days straight requires a lot of patience, people skills, and, believe it or not, physical strength. The ENO booth takes Mangum two hours, sometimes more, to set up by himself, but if there’s one thing he’s learned during his yearlong stint of working the festival circuit, it’s this: be kind to your neighbors. 
 
“You’re always gonna need help no matter what,” Mangum says. 
 
Though he’s had some great festival neighbors over the past year like Sierra Nevada and Kitchen Craft, who fed him throughout the weekend, Mangum’s favorite neighbor would have to be a friendly girl by the name of Ashley, who worked the non-profit Rock the Earth’s booth at Mountain Jams in 2014. 
 
“She sat in a hammock and we talked for three days straight,” Mangum says. 
 
     Because really, what other ingredients do you need for falling in love beyond hammocks, tunes, and conversation? 
 

 
Zach Adams 
 
>> Trail builder, Heart of the Highlands Trail System 
 
Canaan Valley, W.Va. 
 
Zach Adams, 25, doesn’t have to worry about donning a suit and tie for his job. In fact, he could get away with wearing the same pair of Carhartts for a week straight if not for the torrential downpours that frequent his home in Canaan Valley, W.Va. But as a contract trail builder for the Heart of the Highlands Trail System, Adams is not in it for the casual dress code. He’s in it for the art. 
 
“It’s super rewarding,” says Adams. “Creating a new build is my favorite part.” 
 
You need only ride a minute from the town of Davis, W.Va., to get a taste of his trails firsthand. Rock gardens, log piles, and other technical trail features are standard fare on Splashdam Connector, Adams’ most prized trail. So what goes into all of that glorious, techy riding? 
 
“We move a lot of muck and we move a lot of rocks,” Adams says, which, when you’re at it 40 hours a week in less-than-ideal weather, can be downright exhausting. 
 
Fortunately, Adams regularly employs the help of local AmeriCorps workers, volunteers, and, of course, a mini excavator and rogue hoe, his favorite tools. As a former cyclocross competitor and race organizer for his brainchild, Fast Forward Racing Productions, Adams knows the recipe for the perfect trail—“rocks, techy slow moves, fun flow sections…diversity, you know,” all of which he strives to include in his own builds or reconstructs. 
 
It’s unglamorous work at best. Often muddy, saturated, or overgrown, the trails and elements of Canaan Valley are a force to be reckoned with. But for Adams, no matter how many tons of rock he hauls, no matter how many thickets of mountain laurel he wrestles, any day in the woods is better than a day at the desk. Plus, who wouldn’t enjoy cruising the fruits of your labor after a hard day on the clock? 
 

 
MacKenzie Hatcher 
 
>> Photo boater, Laurel Highlands River Tours 
 
Ohiopyle, Penn. 
 
Imagine a kayak for a desk, a stomping class IV-V river for a daily commute, an afternoon rush hour packed with commercial rafts. For photo boater MacKenzie Hatcher, 21, that’s been her work reality since she was just 15 years old. And though she has to wear a skirt to work everyday, she wouldn’t have it any other way. 
 
“I love kayaking and really enjoy taking photos, so getting to combine those two things makes it the best job,” Hatcher says. 
 
Having grown up on the banks of the Youghigheny River in southwestern Pennsylvania, Hatcher, the daughter of river rat parents, has been kayaking for most of her life and shooting photos since high school. After attending the New River Academy, a traveling high school for kayakers that concentrates on videography and photography, Hatcher thought it only natural that she should continue her passions on her hometown river. 
 
“There’s a lot to it,” Hatcher says. “People think it’s an easy job,” but you try safely navigating your way solo through pods of rafts, or “floating undercuts,” amid technical whitewater, adjusting your camera settings to constantly changing light, and still creating consistently quality images without mishap. 
 
Hatcher’s pretty dialed in at this point, and most problems are usually just dead camera batteries or full memory cards, but there have been a few out-of-boat experiences that have left her more than shaken. 
 
“I also shoot photos on the Cheat River, and I once swam out of Big Nasty,” Hatcher says, recalling the class IV river was at high spring flows close to five feet. “I was by myself, but I somehow managed to get all of my gear to shore and still get photos of the trip coming down.” 
 
Short of kayaking and camera skills, photo boating requires a good deal of grit and a wild hair. Fortunately for Hatcher, she’s well endowed with both.

1. BE WILLING : As in, be willing to forgo sleep, to be poor, to have people look at you like you’re crazy, to sometimes think you are crazy. Be willing to ride the peaks and valleys of chasing your passions. 
 
“That’s one of the biggest things,” Pat Goodman says. “Be willing to have everything go differently than you had planned it to and still be excited about the adventure.” 
 
2. LOVE YOUR PARENTS : Because hey, you got that knack for adventure somewhere, right? It also helps to have a good relationship with your folks in case, you know, your Kickstarter campaign falls flat on its face. Or when you need a staging area in between moves, like Eva Surls and her now-husband Cashion Smith did before moving to Brevard. 
 
“We moved in with my parents for eight months which I would never recommend to any adult couple,” Surls says. “I’m still recovering from that.” 
 
3. TRAVEL : You’re not gonna get inspired sitting on Google or scrolling through Instagram feeds. Get out there and see the world and find out where you want to fit into all of that. 
 
“My appreciation and drive for new things grows every time I travel,” says Emily Shanblatt. “It’s a lifelong mission.” 
 
4. BE YOUR OWN BOSS : If you’re going to create your future, you’re going to have to create your own boss, too. Make plans, and stick with them. More importantly, act the part. 
 
“Time management is so important,” Bryan Mangum says. “You can’t get bored. Find something to do and don’t take it for granted.” 
 
5. BE PERSONABLE : No matter how skilled you are, no matter if you’re the best photographer on the entire planet, if nobody likes you, nobody is going to hire you. 
 
“That’s why people come back [rafting],” MacKenzie Hatcher says. “It’s based on how personable you are and how much you make them feel welcome and give them a good time.” 
 
6. KEEP LEARNING : And don’t stop learning. Ever. Whether it’s through workshops or shadowing or interning or heck, even volunteering, build your skills and listen to those who came before you. 
 
“Get involved,” says Zach Adams. “Do it right from the start.”

4563,"BELLA COOLA, B.C. - A First Nations woman from British Columbia's central coast is suing the province after two Mounties allegedly threatened to seize her three young children if she didn't let them search her vehicle for marijuana and crack cocaine. 

Kimberly Mack will appear in provincial court in Bella Coola Thursday asking to be compensated $15,000 for what she alleges was an illegal search that failed to turn up any drugs. 

""When I meet up with the cops now I feel a lot of anger,"" said Mack in an interview. ""When I think they can get away with so much I feel angry towards them. 

""I would just like an apology. That's my main thing."" 

RCMP Cpl. William Wallace, Const. Nick Jenkins and B.C.'s attorney general are named in the lawsuit. 

A notice of civil claim states Mack was driving back to Bella Coola on May 28, 2010, with friends and family from a potlatch in Vancouver, when she parked outside a grocery store close to home for a washroom break. 

Acting on an anonymous tip, police pulled alongside the vehicle and asked Mack for permission to search her vehicle, the notice states. 

""They said, 'Kim, if you do not let us search your van we will get the (Ministry of Children and Family Development) involved. We'll get the dogs to search your van if you're not going to help us,'"" said Mack in an interview. ""I felt that I had to say yes to them."" 

The notice states the officers arrested Mack in front of her eight-, four-year-old and 15-month-old children and searched the entire van, even tearing off the vehicle's panelling. 

""I was scared,"" she said, about the public search. ""I felt embarrassed. Very embarrassed."" 

Mack said she later lost customers from her home-based convenience store and kept her eldest daughter out of school for a month, until life returned to normal. 

""I didn't even want to walk into the grocery store,"" she added. 

The RCMP and the province's Ministry of Justice and Attorney General said they couldn't comment because the case was before the court. 

The ministry also referred questions to the federal Department of Justice because the RCMP was involved in the case. 

Doug King, a Pivot Legal Society lawyer, is representing Mack and her co-plaintiff, Demi King. 

He said they made a conscious decision to try the case in Bella Coola circuit court and not in a larger city, such as Vancouver. 

""The heart of the case is about small communities — especially aboriginal communities — and how they're policed by the RCMP,"" he said. ""This is really a case about a family that was totally innocent and had their life turned upside down."" 

The police allegedly didn't have a warrant, despite having ample time to secure one, said King. 

Mack said she wasn't read her rights, either. 

King said he hopes the case highlights the importance of legal mechanisms that keep police accountable. 

He said the biggest issues in the case was the officers' threat to remove Mack's children, especially given the fraught history that exists between the state and aboriginal communities. 

""A threat to take away somebody's children is not a minor threat,"" said King. ""Historically, it's something that's happened and is a real part of people's lives in communities like this."" 

A date has not been set for the defendants to present their case, but that stage is expected to take place in Vancouver.

2044,"REEHOLD -- Jessica O'Brien's biggest responsibility on Monday afternoon was to keep one of the biggest goal-scoring threats in New Jersey off the board. 

But it was O'Brien's offensive play that turned the game around. 

O'Brien shut down Rutgers commit Nicole Whitley, but her steal and ensuing through ball to forward Betty Feinstein in the 65th minute sent Howell to a stunning 1-0 win over Freehold Township, No. 18 in the NJ.com Top 20, in a typical Shore Conference showdown. 

Feinstein took O'Brien's pass along the right side of the box and slipped the only goal of the game past Freehold Township keeper Kaela Chadziutko and inside the left post to give Howell its fourth straight win since starting the season 1-2. 

""We knew we had to mark up on Whitley, so we marked her 1-on-1 and everyone else just had to play tough D,"" Howell coach Courtney Bonura said. ""We knew we could muscle it out against them. We were fortunate enough to get the through ball that we capitalized on."" 

Freehold Township controlled possession throughout the game and had a number of chances in the contest, but Howell's back line -- led by Penn State commit Rebecca Hamilton -- never let Freehold Township find the back of the net. Rebels goalkeeper Rachel Kern made 11 saves, six in the second half, to earn the shutout. 

""It felt really good because I know a lot of people on that team, I know how they play,"" Feinstein said. ""I know a lot of people on Township usually step up. I was happy that through ball was there, and the goalie wasn't able to get down fast enough to stop my shot to the bottom left. So that's where I placed it."" 

Howell nearly took the lead in the 30th minute, when Feinstein fed forward Sierra Enea, but Chadziutko made the diving save. Whitley countered with a strong chance in the 32nd minute, but her shot was spiked wide of net. 

Laura Noseworthy, after making a couple of moves to slip behind Howell's defenders, found herself in alone in the 61st minute, but Kern kicked out her left leg to keep the ball in front of the goal line and preserve the shutout. 

Since starting the season 5-0, Freehold Township has gone 0-1-1 in its last two games after a 1-1 tie with Freehold Borough and its first loss of the season to Howell. 

""Coach Bonura had a good game plan, she really dug in tight defensively,"" Freehold Township coach Dave Patterson said. ""While they were allowing us to posses, we were having trouble turning that into quality opportunities. We did outshoot them, but we knew their plan was going to be to counterattack. They caught us once.""",e99ed1b5-016e-4484-9952-851357c6e143,News,2015-09-28T22:48:46Z,Star Ledger,Howell (1) at Freehold Township (0) - Girls Soccer,0.0,Blog

3876,"Today we flew from Kathmandu to Lhasa. 

After having an argument with the security guy, who said I couldn't take my helmet as hand luggage, the rest of the hour and a half flight went without a hitch.

But once through the departure lounge had air con and free wifi, which we all took advantage of:





As we flew in over snow capped mountains, with blue sky Mr K and I had to pinch ourselves - we are finally here! 

Warm sun and blue greeted us. This is a dry heat much more manageable than Nepal's humidity.

Getting off the plane I was a bit breathless with a bit of buzzing in my ears - that's the altitude. Others felt their heart racing. A couple of puffs on my inhaler sorted me out.

As you can imagine passport control was a typically, well organised Chinese affair. But I did get talking to a very nice, official young man. He explained that today is a day of celebration - the first day of autumn and they celebrate with moon cakes. He disappeared and came back with a moon cake gift and a greeting written in Tibetan. I'm not sure what it says, but I hope our guide will translate.





The altitude takes a bit of getting used to. Tonight we have had a great Chinese meal. I'm in our room conserving my energy.... but Tony has gone off with the lads to explore and he has the wallet!!!!

Tomorrow we're off on the bikes heading to base camp.",43248eba-a02d-436f-8d37-4b79e3778149,Blog,2015-09-25T23:57:36Z,fionak18's Blog,Tibet!!,1.0,News

Everyone remembers them, once you have seen them (if you liked them or not) you were drawn to the shows as lights swirled around from the iconic weapons of the Jedi and Sith clashed. With the classic game series Star Wars Battlefront due an update courtesy of EA, the latest revelation is that the beta for the new release will be open to everyone, online and offline gameplay. 
 
Included in the beta will be three distinct modes set on three planets, two of which are fairly iconic. First up you have 40 players fighting as Rebels vs the Empire on Hoth fighting to either destroy or protect respectively, then a quick flash across to Tatooine   for a survival experience on your own or with friends to fight off everything from AT-ST’s to Tie Fighters. Finally set on the Sullust (a volcanic planet in the outer rim) will have two teams of 8 fighting over control of drop pods. 
 
Excited yet? Then you will be overjoyed to hear that on Xbox One, Playstation 4 and Origin will all get access to the beta on October 8th, with the companion app giving you access to a strategic card game called Base command, with the ability to unlock weapons and credits for Battlefront. 
 
Are you excited? Will you be supporting the Rebels or the Empire? 
 
Thank you Star Wars EA for the information and the image .

Amazon	Advertisement Related Galleries The Oddly Beautiful Artificial Light of the World's Cities What It's Like to Stare a Hurricane Wave in the Face You Can't Understand Design Without Experiencing These 14 Classic Works Amazon announced six new devices this morning—and not one of them is a phone. In fact, all seven are staunchly not the kind of do-everything device the company attempted with the Fire Phone. With four tablets and two set-top boxes, Amazon made a single statement: We win at entertainment. You want to draw, futz with spreadsheets, or map the human genome? Great. Buy an iPad (preferably on Amazon.com!). But if you’re a Prime member looking for a way to watch movies, read books, or listen to music, Amazon believes firmly there’s no better way than with Amazon. And honestly, it makes a pretty compelling case. Before we go further, here are the seven new devices: • A faster Fire TV box with 4K support: $99.99 • A new Fire TV Stick with Voice Search and Alex voice control: $39.99 • A 10.1-inch Kindle Fire HD tablet: $229 • Same thing, 8 inches: $149.99 • A 7-inch Fire tablet for the super-cheap: $49.99 • The kids’ version with a bumper and a two-year replacement guarantee: $99.99 Whew! There are a few highlights worth pointing out: The Fire TV’s 4K support (and Amazon’s impressive selection of 4K content) is a huge upgrade, not to mention a pointed victory over the new Apple TV. Alexa integration means you get almost all the capability of the voice-powered Amazon Echo box, right on your TV. The tablets have bigger screens than before, but are thinner and still pretty easy to hold. Everything—everything—is created with reading and watching in mind. The new tablets also come with a completely redesigned version of their operating system called Fire OS 5. Next to the carousel-filled, dark-on-dark interfaces Amazon’s built before, Fire OS 5 is a refreshing and desperately needed change. Now, you get a light background and a grid of content; your favorite stuff on one page, your recent stuff on another, all your movies on another yet. It feels usable, really for the first time. And there’s a reason: Amazon has finally figured out exactly what the Fire devices are about. Remember that old maxim “tablets are for consumption?” As other big companies like Apple and Microsoft have fought tooth and nail to prove they’re more than just movie-watching devices, Amazon’s leaning into the idea. These are devices for watching movies. And reading books, and watching TV shows, and listening to music. Thing is, Amazon is really, really good at those things. And there are lots of people who want them. Amazon’s proven it can make good hardware and sell it for less than most of its competitors. That’s true here too: the new Fire HD tablets are thin and light, and still impressively durable. During his demonstrations, Dave Limp, Amazon’s head of devices, pulled out an iPad Air and a Fire HD that had gone through equivalent tests. The iPad’s screen was shattered; the Fire’s plastic was scuffed but the device was otherwise perfect. They have decently loud speakers, lots of nice accessories, the whole nine yards. Even the $50 model looks pretty good! On the TV side, the Fire TV has been maybe the best set-top box on the market since the day it came out. (Or at least since whatever day it finally got HBO.) Now, with Alexa, the voice search should be even more useful. There’s a new controller for gaming, a bunch of upgraded hardware inside the box, and improvements to the ASAP feature that pre-caches video to make it play faster. And not only do the new set-top boxes offer 4K streaming, they use a better kind of video encoding (called HEVC) that uses less bandwidth to stream video. That means you’re more likely to get a high-def stream, even when you have a bad connection. Every good new feature of the new devices exists in service of one single thing: content. Books, music, movies, TV shows, games, all the things you do when you’re not doing the work everybody else wants you to do on their tablets. When Amazon does its job well, it makes finding and consuming stuff easier than anyone else. There are plenty of gaps in Amazon’s content ecosystem, sure. And let’s not forget that you’re still paying $99 a year for access, on top of the price of your device. (If you’re not already a Prime subscriber, any Fire device basically morphs into one unending Prime commercial.) But Amazon has integrated so many other sources—there are 3,000 channels, apps, and games for Fire TV, they say—that anything you can’t find from Amazon you can probably get from Netflix, Hulu, HBO Now, Sling, or, I don’t know, the Red Bull channel. It’s tough to beat the Fire ecosystem when it comes to the size of the content firehose. Now, the products are finally focused on this core competency and little else. Rather than blindly assume everyone lives entirely within Amazon’s ecosystem—which has proven a road to ruin—the company’s just hoping people want to watch some movies. After years of trying to find itself, Amazon finally seems to have a clear sense of what its own devices are for. It’s finally not competing with the iPad and Rokus of the world. These devices are mostly just another benefit to Prime customers, like two-day shipping or the super-cheap grocery shopping options. That clarity of purpose seems to have come with a certain clarity of execution, too. Amazon’s devices should be good enough to make that content easy to access, and as cheap as physically possible. (Someday, we’ll all get these devices free with our Prime subscriptions.) Amazon’s software should be insanely easy to use, and its recommendations should be so good you never run out of stuff to do. Once all that happens—and the new devices are a pretty big step in that direction—Amazon’s going to have a hell of a device lineup on its hands. Just as long as it doesn’t try making any more phones.

276,"A TULLIBODY care home is “delighted” to have received an Eat Safe Award from Clackmannanshire Council. 
 
The Orchard Care Home, run by HC-One, was handed the accolade during a special presentation last Wednesday morning. 
 
The award is given to food businesses that have achieved standards of food hygiene which surpass legal requirements. 
 
It is managed by Food Standards Scotland and administered in the Wee County by the local authority’s Environmental Health Team which is responsible for regulating food businesses. 
 
The Orchard’s award was presented by the Provost and local councillor Tina Murphy, in the main dining room in front of residents. 
 
Manager Jane Aitken, said: “The Orchard is delighted to have received this award from Councillor Tina Murphy. 
 
“I am extremely proud of the level of food hygiene within The Orchard, and the level of hard work and commitment that the cook, Susanne Stirling, and all the kitchen staff display.” 
 
Provost Murphy, added: “I was delighted to present the award as it pays tribute to the high standard of food preparation at The Orchard. 
 
“Good food is essential as we get older and it is clear that Susanne and staff take this seriously. The award was achieved by the hard work and dedication from The Orchard’s cook and kitchen staff.” 
 
Alongside the Eat Safe Award, the team at The Orchard were also pleased to have received an excellent report from the Care Inspectorate. 
 
The report shows that the home received the top mark in five of the eight categories.

Next up, we made our way over to the Wemakethings booth to visit our good friends from Germany and to get a full look at what they have cooking for Wethepeople, Eclat, Salt Plus and Fuse Protection (We’ll have a separate post for Almond Footwear next)! As always, they always have a TON of new products to check out, so let’s see all of the BMX goodness!
The new Alex Kennedy signature AK Guard Sprocket features a nylon removable guard that can be rotated and changed out. Definitely a unique design and it makes it easier and more affordable than replacing your entire sprocket after a lot of grinding.
The new Bruno Hoffman grip that is in the works. It features a mushroom style pattern but the ribs are offset thickness to give it a softer feel. It also features the Cologne skyline which is a nice touch.
Here’s a sample of a new tire they’re working on. I want to say this is a Bruno Hoffmann tire, but I might be wrong. Took in a lot of info for their new line.
The new Cortex freecoaster is a new addition to the Eclat line. It features a clutch system but it’s different than the KHE design. Expect more details closer to its release.
Hub guards to fit all of the Eclat and Wethepeople hubs.
The Blind freecoaster got a little bit of an update after having issues with the spring they originally used. Now they have individual springs on each pawl to resolve the problem.
Eclat and Wethepeople have a number of new stems, most of which utilize these small cuts to give the bars a little more to grab on to.
The latest version of Sean Burns’ signature stem.
Can’t go wrong with a metal pedal. They have made the ends stick out a little further to protect the outside end of the pedal for this year.
That new camo color looks good.
The Alex Kennedy pedal which eliminates bearings and uses an over sized spindle should be out soon.
Another look at the AK sprocket.
The Universal guard that fits over the outside of the drop out.
New black and anodized silver color looks so good.
The Brock Olive signature bars from Eclat are big and strong. They use straight gauge tubing to keep it strong throughout.
New seat color options.
The new tan peg color for the Eclat plastic pegs.
New purple colorway on their new rim.
Here’s a look at two of the new rims that Eclat are working on. Not the best photo, but we’ll be hearing more soon.
Red, black and polished will be the main focus colors, but there are a few others that will be available as well.
Go through a lot of wax? This new block of wax comes with a few blocks all connected and wrapped up tight like a burrito. Break a piece off, drop it in the session bag and go get your grind on.
Eclat Pulse hubs in red.
Here’s a look at the latest version of the Grippin’ tire to give you street guys plenty of grab.
The Feelin’ tire has been gaining popularity so they have made it a little bigger to give you even more grip.
Here’s a prototype Wethepeople 4-piece bar that utilizes the new 25.4mm diameter tubing at the clamping area that tapers to a regular size at the grips.
Tripod and Pivotal seat options from Wethepeople.
Here’s a look at a new 2-piece crank that Wethepeople are working on. This is a true 2-piece because the arm is welded to the spindle eliminating the extra material needed when you have a 3 or 2.5-piece design. Those pedal and spindle gussets look good.
Ed Zunda signature 2.5 piece cranks in the works. You know if Ed’s name is on it, it will be sturdy!
Wethepeople have a new top load stem that will be available with 3 different rises and 3 different color options. So, yeah, 12 options total to choose from. They also utilize the ridges to keep your bars from slipping.
Clean new sprocket. Nice and simple.
The reptile grip.
The Helix freecoaster has a slimmer shell and a new hub guard to keep it from breaking.
They have made it so these hub guards come with all the different cones for all their different hubs to ensure compatibility. Pretty rad.
They have been working on an updated version of their cassette with a 15mm female axle and bearings to go with the Q-Lite driver.
Tripod and Pivotal post.
The Mike Curley signature Switch fork looking dialed with the CNC machined drop outs that are inserted into the legs and welded, tapered legs and the boxed steer tube / leg junction. Clean and sturdy.
The new Dillon Lloyd signature Buck frame.
Ed Zunda’s new signature frame!
Fresh paint on Dan Foley’s Cadence frame.
Patron and Scorpio frame.
18″ Envy frame and fork for the young guns.
They have beefed up the Utopia frame a bit to be more for the flatland / street guys versus just flatland. That green color looks amazing too.
Dillon Lloyd Buck bars have 25.4mm clamping area and the traditional size. Dillon runs the bigger version for those of you wondering.
Sterling four-piece bars. Straight gauge tubing, 25.4mm clamping area and wider radius bends.
Digging that new tan colorway for the Patron frame. The Patron fork will match that color as well.
Patron stems.
New barends made from stainless steel. Looks good!
If you notice… the 30 tooth is coming back!
Wethepeople have a HUGE range of completes from the 12″ bikes all the way up to the top of the line 20″ as expected and these bikes are DIALED.
Fuse Protection helmet and pads. Those shin pads with the longer top to partially cover the knee are rad.
The new Delta bike bag from Fuse. Learn more about that here — Fuse Protection – Delta Bike Bag
Wrist wraps!
Floor and hand pumps to keep those tires filled.
New Salt Plus tire. Similar to the Eclat Fireball, but more affordable.
Salt Plus freecoaster. Similar design as the new Eclat freecoaster, but with a regular axle, bolts, etc. to help keep the costs down. This is available as a complete wheel as well.
Digging that black and blue swirl color on the Salt Plus stem.
New mushroom style grip.
Salt Plus Chain Breaker!
Salt Plus 4-piece bars.
Regular and guard sprocket. That black and blue swirl to match the stem.
Woof! That was A LOT to cover! If you have any questions, let us know in the comments below. That wraps up Wethepeople, Eclat, Salt Plus and Fuse Protection!

2127,"Law enforcement officials are urging the public to watch out for sweepstakes scam letters that have been appearing recently in the mailboxes of Kauai residents. 
 
“Recently, we have seen an increase in these types of scams targeting our community. The letters promise huge payouts to the recipient if the recipient first pays a ‘processing fee,’ usually between  $10 and $20,” said Prosecuting Attorney Justin F. Kollar. “These letters often have official-looking seals and signatures and may appear to be very serious, usually urging immediate action and warning recipients not to share the letter or its contents with anyone else.” 
 
These scams often target seniors and retired persons as they tend to be more trusting of unknown individuals. Responsible family members should help to protect them from falling victim. 
 
“The basic rule is that if it looks too good to be true, it probably is,” Kollar said. “Please be very careful anytime you are asked to send money or personal information to somebody you don’t know personally. Once that money is gone, in all likelihood, it is not coming back.” 
 
Residents who have questions or concerns can contact the Office of the Prosecuting Attorney at 241-1888, the Kauai Police Department at 241-1711, or the County of Kauai Agency on Elderly Affairs, 241-4470.

7463,"I’ve been fortunate to spend a good deal of time this summer tending a lush garden outside Toronto in Oshawa. My aunt and uncle have lived here for over 53 years but still add new plants each year. The high temps during August were hard on these perennial hibiscus but with frequent watering, at one point up to 3 times a day, we managed to save them.    
  
Lucky for southern Ontario it wasn’t too dry a summer. The western provinces were plagued, and still are, by raging fires and drought conditions. In Canada we all too often take water for granted. I was recently reminded of just how precious this non-renewable resource is when I attended a reception at the Toronto Exchange hosted by WINDS OF CHANGE.  (More about them in an upcoming article)    
As I watered our tranquil sanctuary this morning I thought about how lucky we are to turn on a tap and have access to a seemingly unlimited supply of clean water. Yesterday I was ordering a personal water filter for my trip to Peru and was considering the multitude of illnesses that many face each day by not have a reliable source of clean drinking water. I reflected on the poverty created by droughts in agricultural regions as I photographed the dew of late summer morning.  
I’m asking that you take a moment each time to turn on a tap to give thanks for fresh water. Use it sparingly. Cherish our resources. We’re too often careless with a commodity that many millions are denied. Thanks to Rob Scott, co-founder of Winds of Change, for sharing your expertise with families in Nicaragua and stimulating opportunities for growth by building windmills to pump ground water to surface.  
I’m inspired by these types of programs and will be documenting sustainable communities in Peru where both locals and international activists are creating impactful change.",b02d5a5c-15f0-437c-b5c3-51a66bf4fc6e,Blog,2015-09-17T17:32:12Z,"The Big Picture, The Fine Print",Saying goodbye to Summer,1.0,Blog
6123,"It is 2015, and social media is everywhere. It is embedded in your smartphone, and its logos are printed on nearly every product packaging. A few years ago, having an online presence by way of a website for a company was enough. Today, consumers expect a company to have a presence on the App Store, Play Store and every social media platform out there. It has become a way of social proof for both ends of the spectrum – companies and consumers. On the consumer end, you expect to be able to interact with your favourite company on Twitter, Facebook and even Snapchat and Periscope. Meanwhile, organisations are faced with enormous challenges that stem primarily from the lack of security architecture of most social media platforms. Even the bigger players like Facebook and Twitter do not have mechanisms for integration with your internal account management systems that come out of the box. Social Media Conundrum Users these days are technology-aware and are looking to use or are already using new systems and services within the network that will simplify their lives and benefit their employer. IT security is either unaware or can’t keep up with such deliberate actions. It should be noted that users don’t have malicious intentions but rather lack education. However, the implications that arise from such employees’ deliberate use of social media constitutes a rather multifaceted problem. I have listed some of my findings below ranging from technical to behavioural components. The Beauty of Accessible Technology These are several exploits that have been used online and have made their way into social media services. A paper written by SANS in 2011 details exploits that have been used with social media, and sadly these have not been addressed until today. 1. Account Management Many social media platforms begin as start-up companies that focus on creating a cheap, fast, agile SaaS or application. Implementing security frameworks is not affordable upfront and is therefore neglected. Their architectural implementation is scattered across third-party suppliers, raising further compliance headaches with IP stored outside your borders. Popular platforms like Facebook and Twitter were designed with consumers in mind, and even today don’t address account management within organisations. A great example is Facebook requiring a personal Facebook account to be able to create a Business page. Another platform that is gaining ground fast is Instagram. To sign up for Instagram, you have to use your personal Facebook account or sign up with another email account that could be your corporate email address. Even when signing up with a company email address, in the case of a marketing department, there is no centralised user management and account credentials sharing is inevitable. To avoid having additional accounts to manage, the use of the existing Facebook account becomes preferable. That leaves the organisation exposed and dependent on that personal email address that initially signed up for Facebook. Although there are hundreds of social media services available today, I’m only talking about Facebook and Twitter mostly because of their “Domino effect.” These not only are the highest used but also provide single sign-on services to the rest of the web. 2. Identity Theft – Phishing A corporation ignoring social media will cause more harm than good in the not so distant future. If you are not expanding your real estate online with information that reflects your brand, someone else can take advantage of that. An example would be an attacker registering social media accounts under your brand and guiding your customers into SPAM and C&C servers. It is a bit different than phishing as the attackers can use the actual name in the account. 3. Social Media & Account Management Policy Social media policies within organisations tend to either disallow the use of such services altogether or allow partial access for business use. The caveat is not specifying any controls within the account management policy regarding external accounts. 4. User Awareness Staff sharing information on their personal social media accounts about their organisation can have an adverse impact on their employer’s reputation. Since these platforms are outside their jurisdiction, takedown requests will involve legal proceedings and will take time. Raising awareness about social media use within your company is essential. Conclusion As it happens with most products, social media services come in a neat packaging and require minimal interaction from the user to start transmitting information over the network. Anything from your location to your IP addresses to your footprinting data is out there. It is very enticing for users to sign up and agree to the T&C. As security professionals, we know that it is our job to inform and educate our users about the pros and cons and offer solutions. It is crucial for IT security to act as an enabler. Also, having a proactive stance on new services either by testing or reading whitepapers can equip us better to respond to threats. It will also safeguard our organisation from impact to the CIA (Confidentially, Integrity, Availability) of our key services.   About the Author: Peter Skaronis (@Peter_Skaronis) works for an Insurance company in Milton Keynes, UK.

A 27-year-old man who stopped at a gas station on Detroit's west side early this morning was shot as he approached two men stealing his SUV, police said. 

The man was at the Valero gas station at about 3:20 a.m. on Greenfield and Schoolcraft and apparently left the vehicle running as he went inside the station. When he saw the two men entering his 2005 silver Ford Escape, he approached the men and one fired shots at him, striking him, said Detroit police officer Dan Donakowski. 

The two men in black hoodies fled the scene in the vehicle and the shooting victim remains in serious condition, police said.

691,"Members of the New Castle County mounted police force patrol around Rodney Square on Friday morning. (Photo: KYLE GRANTHAM/THE NEWS JOURNAL) 

WILMINGTON With mourners still gathering to grieve the loss of Thomas “Cannibal” Cottingham, who was stabbed in Rodney Square on Monday as he intervened to protect a mother and her child as they were being chased by a man with a knife, police officers launched a campaign for a more visible law enforcement presence in the square on Friday. 

The New Castle County Police brought out their mounted patrol to be stationed in the square, the heart of the city’s central business district, and Wilmington police officers patroled on bikes and in marked cars. 

“This isn’t about combating crime, this is about making people feel safe,” said Col. Elmer Setting, pointing to the six officers on horseback that lined the green Friday morning. 

Setting said the county has also launched a mobile patrol unit in Wilmington to bolster the efforts of the city department, but residents and those who were walking around the area on their lunch break seemed drawn to the mounted patrol, coming up to pet the large Clydesdales and snap a photo. 

“For the kids it is just fun,” said Sheila Carn, whose sons Javier and Ezekiel stood in awe looking up at the horses. 

While her children took in the spectacle, Adam Young, who recently moved to the Residences at Rodney from Philadelphia, said the stabbing just around the corner is disconcerting. 

He said the slaying was a random act that could have happened anywhere, but the fact that it happened around the corner is shocking. 

“You don’t expect that to happen,” said Young, who added he thinks the area is a little dangerous. 

“Even during the daytime I wouldn’t walk terribly far.” 

Aaron Stansell, a kitchen managers at Ernest and Scott Taproom, flagged down police after the alleged assailant, Calvin Hooker III, walked by the restaurant. 

“I know Wilmington is dangerous,” said Stansell, who was recently robbed at gunpoint near 8th and Orange streets while walking to his car after work one night. 

“They just walked up to me and put a gun to my head,” Stansell said. The robbers got away with $40 and Stansell’s cell phone. 

“I think people pretty much know that it’s dangerous and so they don’t live here or come here,” he said. 

Stansell said he only continues to work here because it is good money. 

Sheila Carn, who lives in Riverside, said the increased police presence is about safety. 

“I think it is good because we need more cops,” Carn said. While she has her own concerns about her neighborhood, Carn said it is also needed in Rodney Square where people congregate and loiter for hours. 

“This is a big population for drugs. People sleep here,” Carn said, admitting she doesn’t take the bus alone at night and tries to leave work before it gets too dark. 

In addition to the stabbing on Monday, a man was shot in the chest on the 800 block of N. West Street in January inside an apartment. The area around Rodney Square typically sees crime like thefts from buildings and robberies, according to city crime data. 

For Haley Peoples and Amy Riddell, who work in the Nemours Building, the presence of police and the mounted patrol are a relief. The women said while they have never been the victims of violence, they know co-workers who have, some having their cell phones stolen as they walked to their cars. 

“Just seeing the mounted patrol and knowing that they are there makes you feel better,” Riddell said. “And I know is that someone is watching my back.” 

Peoples said the violence has made her think twice about working in downtown Wilmington, but hasn’t been enough of a problem to make her leave. 

“I have a family to look out for,” Peoples said. 

Paige Mikstas, who also works downtown, said she feels unsafe walking and crime is definitely one of the factors keeping her from moving into Wilmington. 

“I have friends who live on Market Street and sometimes will stay after work,” Mikstas said. “I think if they don’t live close by, people try to avoid the area after, like, 7 p.m. or 8 p.m.” 

Mikstas said she is uncomfortable walking around in the city after dark. 

“You just have to take the general precautions like don’t walk around alone, walk fast,” Mikstas said. “My dad always told me to look pissed off when walking alone and feeling uncomfortable, because then no one will bother you.” 

Downtown Visions, a public-private organization aimed at improving the downtown, offers safety escorts for employees walking to their vehicles or to public transportation, to help ease any fears, said Marty Hageman, the organization’s executive director. 

Between July 2014 and June 2015, the “safety ambassadors” were called to 4,556 safety escorts, Hageman said. 

“The number of requests tends to decrease when it is warmer out and increase in the winter, when the sun sets earlier,” he said. 

WSFS bank, which employs about 275 people in Wilmington, said they often share safety tips with employees, including encouraging them to use the safety escort services offered by Downtown Visions, said spokeswoman Cortney Klein. 

The Delaware College of Art and Design does the same with students moving into dorms in the Wilmington Campus and provides information for the safety escort program to them. 

“We carry security guards in our buildings and in our residence halls and we have key cards and video monitoring,” said Jason Mokar, director of student services at the school. Mokar said the school has never had any issue with violence or safety concerns, but takes precautions like on any college campus. 

The call for an increased police presence was heard loud and clear from the business community earlier this year as some threatened to consider relocating from downtown. 

Wilmington Police Chief Bobby Cummings said his department has worked to increase the presence in the central business district, and the help of New Castle County Police will boost the patrol numbers there. 

Wilmington Mayor Dennis P. Williams echoed Cummings, saying the city cannot afford to lose businesses, so there must be a sustained law enforcement effort downtown and there must be an effort to address the homeless who gather as well as those who suffer from drug addiction or mental illness. 

That effort by police hasn’t gone unnoticed by businesses, said Richard Heffron, the head of the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce. 

“I know they are trying,” said Heffron. 

Mac Nagaswami, CEO of Carvertise, located in the Hercules Building at 1313 N. Market Street, said he and his employees haven’t ever had a problem with crime and feel comfortable walking around downtown. 

“The reality is here in downtown there is such a large visual presence so everybody feels safe,” Nagaswami said. 

But for residents who live in the area, crime is a persistent and serious concern. 

Ben Cohen, president of the Midtown Brandywine Neighbors Association, said his group has reached out to police asking for additional patrols and surveillance. 

“I think we are pretty concerned about crime,” Cohen said, adding that one of his neighbors was held at gunpoint a few weeks ago, but escaped unharmed. “There is a concern about public safety in the city at the moment.” 

Mike Hare, senior vice president for Buccini/Pollin, a development group that has several apartment buildings in downtown Wilmington, including on Rodney Square, said the company polls its residents about living downtown and safety has not been a top issue for most. 

“People who choose to live downtown are used to more mess than most,” Hare said, adding that any kind of violence is unacceptable and a concern for those who work and live in the area. 

“I think some people are shaken by the incident this week,” Hare said. “As long as these incidents don’t continue and there is an appropriate police response it will be OK. We remain advocates as a company for improved public safety deployment in the city and have long been advocating for mounted patrols to come back, but our goal is to eliminate the concern.” 

Cohen, whose neighborhood is just a few blocks from Rodney Square said he is encouraged seeing more and more officers on the street. 

“I believe they are doing the best they can,” he said. 

Brian Lofink, who lives in the Midtown Brandywine neighborhood and works downtown, said right now things seem pretty safe, but if crime continues to increase and move toward his neighborhood, it could be a reason to think about moving out. 

“I could see it becoming an issue at some point,” he said.

6231,"Another Pope, a Different CubaWhy Francis Can Expect a Warm Welcome in HavanaTom QuigleyAugust 31, 2015 - 12:47pmIt was just a simple announcement. On April 22, Holy See press spokesman Fr. Federico Lombardi, SJ, revealed that Pope Francis had ""decided to pay a visit"" to Cuba on his way to the United States in late September. Pay a visit. It almost sounded like an afterthought.Contrast that with the Sturm und Drang that accompanied Pope John Paul II's 1998 visit to Cuba. It was a momentous event, arguably as significant in its time as the Obama-Castro handshake at the Panama Summit of the Americas last April.At the time of John Paul's visit, I was advising the U.S. Conference of Catholic bishops on Latin American issues. My office helped to coordinate events before and during the trip. Several memories from those days stand out. Here's one: As John Paul's plane was approaching José Marti airport that Wednesday, January 21, 1998, ABC News invited me to provide color commentary. I was seated on a large platform in the middle of Havana's Parque Central surrounded by a crowd of several hundred people patiently waiting for something—no one knew quite what—to happen. I had been fitted with a microphone and an earpiece, and was listening to TV journalists chattering on the plane about what was rumored, what was confirmed, and what could be reported. The pope landed, but I was never called on to speak. When the ABC producer came to fetch me, I learned that the story of the day was about someone named Monica Lewinsky. Much of the media headed home.Prior to John Paul's arrival, no one knew for certain how accommodating the Cuban government would be. The Cuban Interests Section in Washington left little doubt that the visit was initially viewed skeptically by the Cuban government. There were no guarantees about radio and TV coverage, nor was there certainty about venues for the papal events. That everything fell into place during the final days, including full coverage on national TV, ensured that it would be a major moment in Cuban history. (Archbishop Jorge Bergoglio, it's worth noting, accompanied John Paul on his trip to Cuba.)Pope Benedict XVI made an equally significant visit to Cuba in April 2012. But, while John Paul's visit was met with near universal acclaim in the United States, Benedict wasn't so fortunate. Much of the Cuban-American community, previously dubious of John Paul's meeting with ese hombre, Fidel Castro, looked forward to the trip. But, given that John Paul's visit had failed to dislodge the Castro regime, lots of Americans weren't so sure about Benedict's visit, and it received a fair amount of intense and uninformed criticism in the United States.Francis should fare better. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), of course, deplored Benedict's visit. He and many others on the right are still angry at Obama's handshake with Raúl Castro in Panama, orchestrated in part by Francis, so they can be counted on to ""regret"" the Cuban visit. But there is every reason to expect Francis will be very well received. He will be facing a Cuba that has changed considerably since the last papal visit. Part of the difference comes from the dramatic shift in the Cuban-U.S. relationship, which Francis himself helped bring about.Another difference will be that, to the extent that Francis has access to Cuban radio and TV, he will truly be heard by the Cuban people. John Paul and Benedict, both elderly and neither an accomplished Spanish speaker, gave marvelous speeches—all worth reading but, at the time, barely heard by the people they had come to visit. Papa Bergoglio will be avidly watched and widely heard.Another difference between Francis's visit and his predecessors' is the quality of the papal diplomacy with respect to Cuba. The current prefect of the Congregation for the Clergy, Cardinal Beniamino Stella, was nuncio to Cuba from 1992 to '99 and was instrumental in planning the 1998 visit. (Stella, incidentally, was first sent to the diplomatic academy by his bishop at the time, Albino Luciani, who would later become Pope John Paul I.)What's more, Cardinal Stella was in Cuba last April to celebrate the eightieth anniversary of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the Holy See. The revolution did not sever ties between Cuba and the Holy See. In fact, the ambassador sent to the Vatican by Castro in 1961, Luis Amado-Blanco, stayed in office so long that he became dean of the diplomatic corps. That reportedly irritated the American representative to the Holy See, who was forced to bring up the rear in formal ceremonies.The Holy See did downgrade its representation in Havana when the nuncio, Archbishop Luigi Centoz, had to leave after the Cuban government cracked down on the church following the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. For the next dozen years, the Vatican was represented by a chargé d'affaires, Msgr. Cesare Zacchi. He was finally named nuncio in 1974.On December 29, 2003, the nuncio to Burundi, Irish-born Archbishop Michael Courtney, was murdered as he was about to bring to the European Union damning evidence of crimes committed by the former president of that country. He had just been assigned nuncio to Cuba but, like another man assassinated on December 29, Thomas Becket, Michael Aiden Courtney joined the ranks of murdered archbishops.The past four nuncios to Cuba, with a single curious exception, are all viewed widely as outstanding diplomats. Archbishop Luigi Bonazzi, currently nuncio to Canada, was stationed in Cuba from 2004 until '09. He was succeeded by Archbishop Giovanni Becciu, currently the number two in the Vatican's Secretariat of State. Becciu played a major role in the historic release of prisoners in Cuba, and was brought back to Rome in 2011.Next came Archbishop Bruno Musaro, the exception, known principally for violating the first law of diplomacy: The only place you can criticize the country you're assigned to is in official dispatches. It seems Musaro was on vacation in his native Italy and preached at an outdoor Mass in the city of Castro Marina. Whether he was aware his homily was being taped is unclear, but his criticism of the Cuban government soon went viral.The Cuban people, he claimed, were ""victims of a socialist dictatorship that has kept them subjugated for the past fifty-six years.... The only hope for a better life is to escape the island.... Only liberty can bring hope to the Cuban people.... I am thankful to the pope for inviting me to this island, and I hope to leave once the socialist regime has disappeared indefinitely."" Needless to say, his departure came a bit sooner. Musaro is now nuncio to Egypt.The present nuncio to Cuba, Archbishop Giorgio Lingua, has just come from his post as nuncio to Iraq and Jordan. Lingua's diplomatic discretion is so legendary that friends have a saying that ""Lingua [""the tongue""] doesn't talk."" It will be Lingua who will be at the pope's side in Cuba this month.And then there was the visit that didn't happen. Back in the late 1980s, the church in Cuba had begun to explore the possibility of a papal visit set to coincide with the 1992 Quinto Centenario, the fifth centenary of the beginning of the evangelization of the Americas. In June 1989, the Cuban bishops issued a pastoral letter that made reference to la próxima visita of the Holy Father, indicating that the government had agreed to a visit. But that year was also the year the Berlin Wall fell, soon followed by the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Cuban government was well aware of John Paul's role in ending Communism in Poland. They wanted to keep this Polish troublemaker off their island.After the Soviet subsidies ended, there were shortages of almost everything. Few leaders could have been less welcome than John Paul. But Castro couldn't just withdraw the invitation, so, in a series of ""off the cuff"" remarks in Brazil on March 17, 1990, he denounced the Cuban Catholic Church and its bishops, who, he suggested, would rather be in Miami. That did the trick.Today, Cuba is far from a free and democratic society, but, with a good bit of help from the church it once oppressed, it is getting ever closer. And that will almost certainly count as one of Pope Francis's major accomplishments.Source: Another Pope, a Different Cuba | Commonweal Magazine - https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/another-pope-different-cuba",07bd20e5-cccf-43ff-b873-39aa4062bf2c,Blog,2015-09-01T11:22:40Z,Cuba Solidarity,"Another Pope, a Different Cuba",1.0,Blog

Stop trying to figure out Jim Harbaugh. Even he can't do it. 

""When I have football dreams,"" he says, ""they always finish with a drive at the end of the game. And I'm always playing — I never dream of football where I coach — but I'm not always playing for the same team. Sometimes I'm like a 50-year-old man. Sometimes I'm back in college. I had one not too long ago where I had just retired from pro football, I was in my 30s, but I still had another year of college eligibility left — only I couldn't get a scholarship anywhere. So, I finally ended up at Bowling Green. And there I was. Playing at Bowling Green. A drive at the end of the game…"" 

""And…?"" I say. 

""I wake up before the end of it. Honest. Cross my heart. That's how my football dreams always go."" 

""Wow!"" I pause. ""Maybe you should see somebody for that."" 

""Yeah. But the experts at Stanford will tell you dreams don't mean anything, so …"" 

So? So, there you have it. Confusing. Fascinating. Competitive. Discombobulated. And that's all in the first anecdote! 

I'm telling you, all the armchair psychiatrists and long-distance analysts and social media screamers who went overboard this summer about his shirtless football game, his addiction to khakis, his bunker-like training camp, his tweeting of Judge Judy. Do not try to shake down the consciousness of 51-year-old James Joseph Harbaugh. It's a fool's errand. 

He's just a little … different. 

And that's what makes him good. 

Be like Bo 

There are few advantages to being around this business for 30 years. You lose friends, you watch newspapers fold, you interview college athletes wearing headphones the size of an Apollo 11 helmet. 

But one upside is that occasionally a kid you knew as a player comes back as a coach. And your perspective is deeper as a result. 

Jim Harbaugh is such a case for me. He was Bo Schembechler's quarterback when I arrived at this paper in 1985. I knew him. Fairly well. He was wide-eyed, super energized, and he lit up during conversation as if he'd swallowed a hornet. 

Thirty years later, he hasn't changed much. His eyes still drift into a smoky place between his nose and your face, his brain clicks gears, he comes up with random thoughts and nonrhythmic pauses — and he is still as intense as a welder's torch. 

""I'm so jacked!"" he used to gush in his Michigan days, as if only gravity were keeping him on this earth. Back then, Schembechler had the big office and prowled the locker room. 

Today, that's Harbaugh's job. His season officially begins tonight at 8:30, out in Utah, taking an unranked Wolverines team into uncharted territory, not unlike the way Schembechler took his inaugural 1969 team out of the gate and to surprising heights. That season, the team was pretty talented but the coach was unknown. This season, it's the other way around. 

Still, there is a wonderful symmetry to Harbaugh now doing what ""the old man"" he once worshipped used to do. 

""There's a connection with Bo that goes back to me being 9 years old,"" he admits. ""Bo put food on our table, a roof over our heads. My dad (Jack Harbaugh, who was on Bo's staff) used to come home for dinners and tell us 'Bo said this or that' and I'd be so engaged. We all were. Our whole family."" 

I ask Harbaugh if he ever wanted to be like Schembechler. 

""Yes,"" he responds with no hesitation. ""I remember a few times I had a blue windbreaker and a hat and I'd put a whistle around my neck"" — he laughs — ""and I had my arms crossed, had the scowl, and my mom took a picture of me. No telling where that picture is, but … does that answer your question?"" 

From the heart 

It does. And it should, belatedly, answer a few others. During the final weeks of the 2014 NFL season, speculation about Harbaugh replacing Brady Hoke at Michigan was rampant. But in the media, it became nearly universal that he wouldn't take the job. No way he goes back to college. No way he wants that spotlight. He needs to get back to a Super Bowl, blah, blah, blah. 

I never bought it. To me it was a no-brainer. Why wouldn't Jim Harbaugh want to come back here? Tradition and family are huge to this guy, and Schembechler, who was the biggest influence this side of his father (he often blurred the two together), was like a specter beckoning in the old blue windbreaker. The money certainly would be good enough. And Ann Arbor was a place where Harbaugh could do what he loves to do more than anything. 

Compete. Every year. 

""I didn't really make a list or anything,"" he admits when I ask about the choice. ""I didn't weigh the pros and cons. The decision was made from the heart. 

""Two days later, I was working here."" 

With fervor and focus 

This is how laser-focused Jim Harbaugh can be. A month ago, I saw him at a play, and before it started, I gave him a paper cup from a new charity venture I was developing. After the play ended, I saw him again, backstage. We talked for a while, and as he was leaving, I asked if he happened to still have that cup. I wanted to keep it. 

""Oh, man,"" he said, his eyes suddenly bulging. ""I used it … for chew…"" 

Before I could finish the words ""never mind,"" he was running across the theater. He raced to a trash can. 

""Jim"" I yelled, ""really, no big —"" 

Too late. He was rifling through the trash. He found the cup, came marching back examining it — and then apparently decided it was too dirty to return. He turned and ran to an usher. 

""Excuse me,"" he said, ""where's the nearest bathroom?"" 

""Jim!"" I hollered. ""I don't need it that —"" 

He ignored me. Ignored everything. He ran downstairs, washed the cup out, came jogging into the theater and handed it over, finally making eye contact. I sincerely doubt he ever heard a word I said. He had a mission. He went after it. 

By the way, the cup was clean. 

The competitor 

""Do you have a basic blueprint for rebuilding?"" I ask. After all, this is a man who turned around programs at San Diego, Stanford and the San Francisco 49ers, all in eye-blinking fashion. 

""Well, yeah,"" he says, ""I have a couple of rules. Number one, get competitive. Number two, win a game. Number three, win two games in a row. Number four, win a championship."" 

Too simple? Not necessarily. Because buried inside the rule number one, ""get competitive,"" is everything he has been doing quietly when the spotlight and Twitter aren't capturing his every move. It's in the small things; like intense recruiting, like midafternoon practices in the summer heat (versus the cooler mornings), like the private winking comments Dan Dierdorf recently relayed to me, claiming Harbaugh told a group of former Wolverines, ""We're starting to see some separation"" (meaning the weeding out process of new versus old). 

Harbaugh might have squelched much talk about his team or its chances in 2015. But I have little doubt he will be successful long-term. It's in his DNA. I still remember visiting him after his first NFL play in 1987, as a backup with the Chicago Bears. A year after leading Michigan to the Rose Bowl, he was a third-string pro, and only got in that game for one play, after Jim McMahon went out for some reason and backup Mike Tomczyk did the same. Harbaugh raced out, took the snap, spun around and got sacked. 

Out he came. 

""What'd I lose, 9 yards?"" he asked in the locker room when I saw him. 

""Fifteen,"" he was told. 

""Fifteen?"" he said, shaking his head. ""Oh (bleep)!"" 

And yet on that same day, he privately told me that McMahon — a Super Bowl legend — wouldn't be the starter much longer. I thought he was crazy. But by the end of the next year, McMahon was traded. And Harbaugh was starting games. 

He went on to become a heck of an NFL quarterback, given that he didn't jump off the page with speed or arm strength. He lasted 14 seasons, made a Pro Bowl and was one dropped Hail Mary pass from a Super Bowl in the 1996 AFC championship against Pittsburgh, still one of the gutsiest title games the league has ever seen. 

""Do you ever wonder how your life would be different had that pass been caught and you went to the Super Bowl and won it?"" I ask. 

""Oh, man, it's a good question,"" he says. ""It was an unbelievable day … great competition … but even if I'd done that a thousand times before, now you have to do it again. And now is the only time that matters."" 

As for all the other stuff — the Jim-In-A-Box summer, the headlines, the tweeting, the shirtless photo, the Supreme Court visit, the sometimes spacey media interviews, the decision to run satellite camps in hothouse college football regions, even the dodge-'em attitude with traditional media questions like ""How are you going to do this year?"" or ""Who's going to be your starting quarterback?"" — well, some think Harbaugh is crazy like a fox, and some think he's just crazy. 

I think it's neither. Harbaugh is like Will Ferrell's Ricky Bobby in ""Talladega Nights,"" he just wants to go fast, and whatever goes flying by the window doesn't concern him once it's in his rearview mirror. 

""What do you make of all the attention you've gotten?"" I ask. ""Are you amused by it? Bothered?"" 

""It's irrelevant ... irrelevant. ... Most of it seems like warmed-up oatmeal right now. On to today. On to today's activities."" 

""You're a today person, aren't you?"" 

""Yeah … today — and the future, too. Who's got it better than us? Nobody — except possibly for future us."" 

I believe I heard Matthew McConaughey express the same idea when he won an Oscar. But I'm not making that comparison. 

Size 'em up 

Another reason to suspect he'll be successful. Quarterback is the most important position in football. Harbaugh is a quarterback with every breath he takes. He not only played the role at Michigan and in the pros, he later developed passers like Andrew Luck (Stanford) and Colin Kaepernick (San Francisco). He elevated Kaepernick over Alex Smith when Smith was completing 70% of his throws. 

""What advantage do you have coaching that position?"" I ask. 

""I think everybody that coaches … there's something about their playing career when they're teaching and explaining … you know, you visualize yourself in that position, then you can explain it … 

""But as far as evaluating guys — I think that goes back to being a kid and being on a football team — you always look around and ask, 'Who are the other good quarterbacks here?' Even as a 9-year-old, 10-year-old, you got five youngsters trying out for quarterback, and I'm one of 'em — you're sizing 'em up. 'He does that better than I do … I have to get better at that.' In high school, there's juniors and seniors — You say, 'I could compete against them' …Same when you go to college … same when you go to the NFL combine … you fight for your life in all those situations. And you're sizing everybody up. 

""So, I always like to get a quarterback that I would not have wanted to compete against. I would not have wanted to compete against a guy like Kaepernick … Andrew Luck … Josh Johnson … Alex Smith … It might not have gone well for Jimmy Harbaugh. So, maybe there's something in that. Evaluating guys is just sizing 'em up. Good, better or best."" 

You following that? It's a little scattered. But it's sort of brilliant. 

No guarantees ... yet. 

Which, in the end, is a fairly good summation of Michigan's new coach. Yes, he's all over the place, from Twitter to ESPN to his often drifting monologues. But there's no question he has elevated attention to the U-M program, and with it, its status. Tonight's game is drawing a lot of eyeballs. There's not usually this much interest in a team that went 5-7 the year before and hasn't won its conference in more than a decade. 

Harbaugh won't say what constitutes minimal success this year. Is it a winning record? A wining record in the Big Ten? Beating either archrival, Michigan State or Ohio State? 

All he'll say is the Wolverines need to be ""better today than we were yesterday."" It's a can't-lose response. But he admits that coaches don't hit, tackle, throw or catch. Even Schembechler — who looks down on Harbaugh from three different photographs in his office — only could do so much when his player talent was limited. 

The most promising sign is that, three decades after leading the Wolverines as a quarterback, being ""jacked"" all the time, making brash guarantees about beating Ohio State and delivering on them, Harbaugh is pretty much the same guy. And that guy, quirky as he was, knew how to win and how to wring every ounce out of the talent he was given. What's a more promising profile than that? 

As for trying to analyze his behavior? Save your strength. Even his own dreams won't reveal a conclusion. 

""Is Michigan a place where you can see yourself finishing your career?"" I ask. 

""Yeah…"" he answers. ""God willing and the creek don't rise."" 

I laugh. ""We don't have many creeks in Michigan ..."" 

""Well,"" he interrupts, ""there's actually two interpretations of the word 'creek' in that expression. Have you studied that? Some think 'Creek' refers to Indians. The Creek Indians in the 1800s, but it's also used by people that lived out in rural areas, they gotta get their harvest to town, and they gotta go over a creek, God willing — and the creek don't rise, and …"" 

And? And? And off we go. Here, there, everywhere. Jim-In-A-Box bursts free tonight. All I can tell you is it won't be boring.

531,"A British amateur sailor has died after being hit by a sail while competing in a yacht race. 
 
Andrew Ashman, 49, was less than a week into the year-long Clipper Round the World Yacht Race when he was struck unconscious while sailing off the coat of Portugal. 
 
Veteran sailor and Clipper race founder Sir Robin Knox-Johnston paid tribute to Mr Ashman, who worked for many years as a London Ambulance paramedic. 
 
Sir Robin, the first person to sail non-stop single-handedly around the world, said: ""This is extremely sad news and my heart goes out to his bereaved family and friends, and to his fellow crew who have come to know Andrew with great affection during his training and the early days of this race. 
 
""Safety is always our utmost priority, as our record shows, and we shall investigate the incident immediately in full co-operation with the authorities."" 
 
Mr Ashman, an ""experienced yachtsman"" from Orpington, Kent, was adjusting the sail of his team's boat just after midnight last night when he was knocked unconscious by the sail and possibly the boom, race organisers said. 
 
He was given immediate medical assistance and attempts were made to resuscitate him, but he never regained consciousness and died in the early hours of this morning. 
   Promoted stories   
The vessel was in moderate seas when it was hit by a Force Six strong breeze (24-30 mph / 21-27 knots) and the tragedy happened. 
 
A spokesman for race organisers Clipper Ventures said: ""At this stage it looks like a tragic accident as far as we can see, but obviously there will be a full assessment. 
 
""The skipper and crew have been very upset."" 
 
His boat, sponsored by South African firm IchorCoal, had been sailing around 120 nautical miles off the Portuguese coast heading towards Brazil in the first leg of the race. 
 
Mr Ashman's boat, known as CV21, was part of a fleet which set sail from Tower Bridge last Sunday for the year-long race. 
 
They were in the midst of the first of 14 mini-races and just under a week into the competition when Mr Ashman died. 
 
His team have now diverted to Portugal are expected to arrive near Porto in the early hours of tomorrow morning. 
 
It is the first death in the history of the Clipper Race, which was established nearly 20 years ago.

4161,"Iowa employer health insurance premiums increased an average of 7.7 percent from 2014 to 2015.  This increase is an average that factors in employers receiving an increase, decrease, or no change in their premiums. The Iowa average represents the premium increase employers received prior to making design changes to their medical insurance plans. 
 
Des Moines, Iowa, 
			September 8, 2015	(Newswire) - ​Due to rising health premiums, Iowa  employers are asking employees with single (employee-only) coverage to contribute 22.4 percent more in 2015 compared to the previous year. Employees with family coverage must also pay more, with an  increase of 5.5 percent. Deductibles paid by employees are also moving upward, with double-digit increases. 
 
This is all according to the 2015 Iowa Employer Benefits Study ©, the 17th annual study conducted by David P. Lind Benchmark of Clive, an employee benefits research firm. One-thousand-one Iowa employers participated in this year’s survey. 
 
The study also found that Iowa employer health insurance premiums increased an average of 7.7 percent from 2014 to 2015.  This increase is an average that factors in employers receiving an increase, decrease, or no change in their premiums. The Iowa average represents the premium increase employers received prior to making design changes to their medical insurance plans.  After the health plans were modified by employers, such as increasing employee cost-sharing arrangements, the increase over last year was 2.8 percent for single premiums and 4.6 percent for family premiums. During the similar period, wages for Iowans increased by 3.4% (source: Iowa Workforce Development).  The study also showed: 
 
The combined average annual premiums for all types of medical plans offered by Iowa employers (HMO, PPO , Traditional Indemnity and Consumer-Driven Health Plans) were $6,143 (up 2.8% from 2014) for employee-only coverage and $15,668 (up 4.6%) for employees who include family members.  Since 1999, the year this study began, the single premium has increased by 198 percent while the family premium has increased by 184 percent. 
  
 
Employees are asked to contribute over $93 monthly for employee-only coverage, an increase of 22.4 percent compared to last year. Employees with family members are asked to pay over $417 a month, a 5.5 percent increase over last year ($395). Over the course of 17 years (1999-2015), employee contributions have increased by 140 percent for single coverage and 132 percent for family coverage.  In sharp contrast, the Iowa Workforce Development shows the average weekly wage (for all industries) earned in Iowa increased by 42.7 percent between 2000 and 2014. It is important to note that employers continue to pay about 82 percent of the total single premium and 68 percent of the family premium - similar to results from past studies. 
 
The average deductibles that employees are required to pay has surpassed the 2014 deductibles by $252 for single coverage and $362 for family coverage, representing increases of 18 percent and 12 percent, respectively. The 2015 average deductibles are now $1,662 single and $3,381 family. 
 
As health insurance costs continue to rise, employers vigilantly pursue different approaches to contain their health insurance costs by: 
  
 
Passing some or all of the increased costs to their employees (54 percent) 
 
Absorbing the entire cost increase (31 percent) 
 
Increasing deductibles (18 percent) 
  ""Cost control through additional cost-sharing with employees, having more competition within the marketplace, and driving employee behavioral changes are just a few of the key desires that employers continue to have when offering health coverage.""  
David Lind,
		President of David P. Lind Benchmark 
   
Raising employees’ out-of-pocket costs (15 percent) 
 
Changing insurance companies (13 percent) 
 
Increasing co-payments for office visits (11 percent) 
 
Increasing prescription drug co-payments (8 percent) 
 
Reducing pay raises or bonuses (7 percent) 
 
Offering Consumer-Driven Health Plans (4 percent) 
 
Hiring fewer new employees (4 percent) 
 
Beginning wellness program initiatives (3 percent)   
 

This year, 76 percent of employers reported offering health coverage, a slight decrease from 81 percent from last year.  The most apparent reason for this decrease is that fewer employers with less than 10 employees are reportedly offering health insurance. 
 
Using a 6-point scale, where 1 means “not at all important” and 6 means “most important,” Iowa employers were asked to rate the importance of five key healthcare outcomes they hope to achieve. 
 
Overall, employers responded that “lowering the health risk of employees” was most important, scoring 4.9. “Reducing long-term healthcare costs” and “increasing employees’ awareness of health issues to enable them to make better decisions” followed closely at 4.8 and 4.7, respectively. The final two outcomes were “increasing participation in wellness and health improvement” at 4.3 and “increasing employee use of tools and information on provider price and quality,” scoring a 4. 
 
As for challenges employers face when providing health coverage, “the unpredictability of healthcare costs” and “motivating employees to accomplish healthier behaviors” were two of the top challenges. 
 
Most Iowa employers - 61 percent - believe that having more insurance companies competing will keep health premiums lower. Interestingly, 80 percent of employers with over 1,000 employers felt more competition is necessary.  Asked if hospitals acting as insurance companies would have incentives to control costs, Iowa employers were evenly split, having no clear consensus that this would benefit the marketplace.",2cec9213-47ba-4c3d-b733-3ac868c45bf3,News,2015-09-08T10:11:08Z,I-Newswire,Iowa Employer Health Insurance Premiums Increase 7.7 Percent,0.0,Blog

5882,"Final projections won't be in from Hits Daily Double until Friday and charts out until next Tuesday, but early projections show a strong possibility that four veteran artists could make the top ten on next week's chart.
The top four look pretty set with Drake and Future projected for 380,000 to 400,000 copies (sales plus streaming) of their album What a Time to Be Alive while Lana Del Rey is looking at 115,000 to 120,000 and Mac Miller and the Weeknd at 75,000 to 85,000.
Then things get a whole lot tighter. David Gilmour is looking pretty good for number 5 with projected sales of 68,000 to 73,000 followed by Shinedown (63,000 to 68,000), Ryan Adams (50,000 to 55,000), Andy Mineo (35,000 to 40,000), Keith Richards (28,000 to 32,000) and Alabama (25,000 to 30,000).
The real question here is Ryan Adams who didn't even have an album in the running until the digital release of his Taylor Swift cover album 1989.  Snuck out on Monday, the Swift via the Smiths album seems to have struck a chord and is getting glowing reviews, so it could end up with even higher sales.
Chris Cornell's Higher Truth is also projected just outside the top ten 15,000 to 19,000 in sales.

Samsung meanwhile will officially show off its new smartwatch, the Gear S2, for the first time, having already confirmed the product's existence. 
 
IFA is also traditionally when Samsung shows off the latest in its Galaxy Note smartphone range. However, the technology giant brought this year's announcement forward in an attempt to gain space from Apple's upcoming event.

events social adobe video Exclusive: Adobe's Secret to Creating Truly Social Events [VIDEO]
September 08, 2015 Kameel Vohra If you’re in the Asia Pacific region and working in marketing, you probably know that Adobe recently ran two heavily oversubscribed digital marketing symposiums - in Australia, there were crowds stuck outside the doors. Michelle Gautrin, Adobe’s Senior Social Media Strategist, gave us a behind-the-scenes look at what they think about social, how they’re using social to drive subscriptions, track success, and left a few tips for you to think about when you’re planning your next event.   Below is an edited transcript of an interview with Michelle Gautrin by Kameel Vohra , the complete video interview is available (as above) here.   Michelle, could you tell us a little about yourself and what you’ve been doing? So I’m the senior Social Media Strategist at Adobe for our digital marketing business specifically for the Asia-Pacific region. I was handling the social media strategy for the Adobe Symposium (Singapore & Sydney), helping to generate buzz, amplifying the event and driving online registrations. During the event, making sure that we’re getting the conversation past the four walls of the event, extending our reach and getting out attendees at the events socially involved.   How did you find that the social media campaign actually contributed to your overall event? I think it went pretty well, social has always been an integral part of the business at Adobe, we’re trying to be the most social company in the world. It’s not just the integral part of the event but our overall business strategy. I think at the event particularly because you’ve got all these marketers into one room you want to have a way to interact with them, the best way is online and through social. So you really have to think, what else can you do besides tweeting? How do we interact with them? That’s when our idea for the mobile game was born. I think we did quite well in making sure that we were always interacting with our customers online as well as offline.   Before the event launched, what type of social media tactics were you using to engage the audience and drive social media action? Before the event we were really focusing on the generating buzz and awareness of the event. Gone are the days that we should rely on organic social to push our message, so we invested a lot in paid social. The platforms we picked in particular, because we’re a B2B business, were LinkedIn & Twitter. We ran a few campaigns to make sure that we were: Getting our message out there Driving registration to the event Getting people to our website (spreading awareness) weather they register or not   During the event you were running a social media game, and what else were you doing during the event? So there were several things, the big thing that we did was that social game that you’re talking about. We were thinking, instead of just having that normal twitter stream into the wall, what else can we do to get attendees involved directly? With the importance of mobile we decided to combine mobile and social through gamification which is how the mobile game was born. Then on top of that you know we really want to incorporate an element of creativity because it’s in our DNA & we want to make sure we have that element. So in Sydney we had a visual artist come in and he was – word scribing his interpretation of the keynotes and we Periscoped that live. We had about 700 views over there. In Singapore we changed it to match the Singapore National Day Celebration the Golden Jubilee, we had this character animator booth set up so that attendees could come and enjoy really fun creative elements – like singing happy birthday to Singapore via an animated character.   So did you find that you had a good volume of uptake with the character animations and the artist that you brought in for the Singapore event? Yeah, definitely! The artist in the Sydney event was our most engaged content. His artwork was the most shared content of the event because people just loved the work. For the Singapore caricature animator we had about 30 people that filmed themselves, because it takes a lot to film and generate and everything. When we started putting those animations online we found that they’re getting really high engagement and shares, people were commenting on how fun it was to see themselves in animation, which was a step up from last year. Last year we did a selfie thing, rode on that selfie craze and had a hashtag #AdobeSelfie  - we wanted to do something different, and take it to the next level - but still with that creative element.     Periscope seems like something that’s been very topical. So a lot of people are talking about it. Chris Brogan has recently come out and said that actually it seems to be a giant waste of time why would any business use it? There’s been some very strong polarized views. How did you find the response to Periscope? I thought it was pretty good. I mean we – we were thinking – we didn’t live stream the Sydney event but we wanted to live stream elements of it and I guess the best way to do it at that time was through Periscope. We had the audience and we thought “Why not leverage it?” We got 700 views, that’s 700 people that didn’t attend the event tuning in to listen to you. So I think that’s a great opportunity for marketers out there. If they want to take quick snapshots, not the whole event, depending on the quality of video, it might not be perfect for the whole event, but just snapshots - that’s what you want. You want snackable content fast and quick and that’s why I think it works so well.   In terms of engagement from one year to the next, do you see a large increase in social engagement? Yeah, definitely. I think every year people are getting more and more involved in social because they’re realizing it’s here to stay. So you know at the event there’s 66% of all attendees were tweeting - I think that’s great. Last year we had less than 50%. I am hoping next year we have 80% or 100% - that would be amazing. But yeah, I think marketers aside, people are now understanding that social media is a great way to connect with your peers and a great way to build your personal brand. That’s why we’re seeing the up level of engagement & that’s why I think that we’re trending on twitter.   So you mentioned before that you had a huge volume of audience participation socially during the event what does that look for you year on year? Right. So this year we had about 66% of all overall attendees tweeting online. That’s a great increase from last year we saw about 48%. We also have an overall increase in mentions in totals. We have about 7,000 mentions that’s a 33% increase from last year so we’re constantly seeing our self-improving and engagement growing as people get more and more social and involved.   You talked about how content really is at the heart of what you’re doing and why it’s so important. We hear a lot about why “content is king” and how content really drives not just social but the overall SEO campaign and your overall business direction online. How does that resonate with what you’re doing? Yeah definitely, so we used social media to monitor the pulse of the conversation at the event & the content at the event. We look at different spikes in conversations or mentions happening on social. So if you look at the graph you see a huge spike in conversations during the keynote, because you’ve got a great line up off the speakers packed in the first half of the day, then you see a little bit of lull during the break when people are busy eating and then it spikes up again during the breakouts. Then there’s a bit of a lull, and in the last session where Robert Rose comes on, everyone really loved him, that’s where you see that last spike. So that’s what we use to plan for next year, “What content is working best for us?” breaking it down to see which speaker drove more tweets than others.   Directly using the volume of social activity to track performance of your speakers and off your content during the event? Exactly, yeah.   Do you also do that post event? Is that something that you run as a post event analysis to help plan for next year or to help plan for any other follow-up activities you might run? Yeah so we do quite an extensive post –report analysis both from the event perspective as well as from social because we are trying to find out what are the different activities that we’ve done that will drive more engagement roles. So what are the different content that’s driven more conversations and not – and that will help us plan our content for next year or bring back speakers that we thought worked really well. Is it inspirational, product or strategy? What are the different types of content that are working for our audience today?   In terms of the overall business KPI, everybody knows that social is important, but what are you doing to bring that back to the overall business objectives? Whether that’s leads, sales or any other type of metric that the business might be interested in? As social media managers, we’re always challenged with this question and asking, “What’s your hard metrics? What can you bring back to the business value?” There’s a lot of things we can do. I think let’s talk about from the event perspective. So pre-event we were talked about driving buzz and generation, and the way I track that was seeing how many of my social campaigns drove website views, because that tells me “Okay, these are people looking at the website and following through.” Another KPI would be how many of my social campaigns were leading to direct registration because that’s also a hard metric that we were tasked with - driving online registration. At the event itself, the event billed itself as a leading digital marketing event for the region. The way we looked at that from a social perspective is, “Are we generating the right buzz from the event? What’s the feedback we’re getting online?” The fact that we were trending and we got loads of good customer feedback, suggests that it worked as well.   In terms of your learnings from the last few events that you’ve run, what advice would you give to other marketers that run events? Okay, so from social perspective because that’s where I come from: The first thing would be, social is becoming a key part of the marketing tool kit. You don’t just want to act in silo, you want to make sure you’re really connected with your marketing team & seeing ways that you can innovate and help spread the event beyond those four walls. Making sure you’re working really closely together and that the content is resonating with your audience.   Next, be bold and creative. I think the great thing about being in the social media space is that we can be experimental. Make sure you’re on-top off the latest trends and you know what’s happening. For example, Periscope, give it a try. Go for it, if it works within your context. It’s a great way to get your content out there through video streaming.   Another thing, don’t rely on organically spreading your content via social platforms. Invest in paid social, but make sure you’re investing in the right platforms for your business - whether it’s B2B or B2C, do a bit of research so you know where your audience is.   The last one is from a personal brand perspective. I think we need to see more people out there tweeting at events & getting talking, it’s such a great opportunity to build yourself from a personal brand perspective and getting known as a thought leader in your space.

4438,"St. Louis' mayor says police will be out in full force near Busch Stadium as the Cardinals enter the postseason, after a fan was shot and possibly paralyzed following a game.

Mayor Francis Slay said he will give Police Chief Sam Dotson ""unlimited overtime"" to put more police on the streets. He said he was concerned about ""a higher level of boldness"" by criminals who show little regard for consequences.

Police say two men in a car drove up to 43-year-old Christopher Sanna and his girlfriend, and demanded their belongings after the Friday game. The woman gave up her purse and the couple turned to run.

One of the gunmen fired several shots, hitting Sanna in the back. Doctors believe he likely won't walk again, his mother told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch (http://bit.ly/1KPAd2r ).

""They said it was shattered, and no surgery could repair it,"" said his mother, Candis Sanna. ""They said he could eventually get a little feeling back, but there was no hope for him to walk. It's horrible.""

Christopher Sanna, of House Springs, was shot in a parking lot after leaving a game at which he and his siblings celebrated his mother's 60th birthday.

Sanna's girlfriend called 911 after the shooting. While on the pavement, he called his mother's cellphone and left a message saying, ""Mom, I've been shot.""

Dotson, the police chief, said police have little to go on in their effort to catch the gunman. No surveillance camera caught the robbery, and the description of the shooter is vague. Still, Dotson called the case a priority and has asked the FBI for help.

Sanna manages an automotive store and served six years in the Army. Relatives set up a fundraising site to help with medical bills. As of Tuesday morning, nearly $60,000 has been raised.

Candis Sanna said she expects to be safe when coming and going from a baseball game.

""You think you're safe after a Cardinals game, and you'd think there are police down there and you wouldn't have to worry,"" she said. ""But there were no police there. I don't know why. You get past Fourth Street and there was nobody around.""

The Cardinals hire off-duty police officers to work at the stadium during games, with as many as 25 working inside the ballpark. More are expected for the postseason.

Still, Dotson said the department will increase its presence downtown going into the playoffs.

""People have to feel safe when they come to a baseball game, and they are,"" he said.",379a807f-7622-47de-8e91-395e57138d5a,News,2015-09-29T14:12:07Z,Modesto Bee,St. Louis mayor pledges more police after post-game shooting,0.0,News
4320,"The Thailand Foundation, a unit of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has launched an app to help visitors get access to some of the best street food in Bangkok. 
 
Developed with the support of the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) and the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, the “Street Food Bangkok” app was launched in a special event at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 21 September, 2015. Foreign ambassadors and senior officials from about 20 diplomatic missions in Thailand attended the event. 
 
The app provides information on street food from 121 vendors and stalls across Bangkok, encompassing 25 tasty menus. It will soon be expanded to include street food vendors in Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai and other cities of Thailand. The aim is to bring street food to the attention of both Thais and foreigners and to promote Thai culture and tourism, which would help stimulate the national economy. 
 
In his opening remarks, H.E. Norachit Sinhaseni, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said, “Thailand has long been regarded as the Kitchen of the World, not only because of her richness in agricultural and agro-industrial products that have been exported worldwide, but also of her cuisine that has always been ranked among one of the top ten food in the world. Thai cuisine has been recognised internationally for its unique taste as well as its gastronomic presentation that combines colours, aromatic components, and herbal and medical benefits. 
“In order to promote Thai food further and to correspond to the IT age, the Thailand Foundation has now developed the Street Food Bangkok mobile application to facilitate modern-day travellers, who prefer to use digital gadgets as a tool to explore their destination city and places to eat.” 
 
The Street Food Bangkok app can be downloaded for free onto tablets and smartphones with Android and iOS operating systems and has a user-friendly, easy-to-navigate interface that shows users a range of dishes, sorted by location and type, with details of specialty dishes listed as well as preparation techniques and ingredients. There are also directions to each stall or shop and opening times. 
 
Mr. Siripakorn Cheawsamoot, TAT’s Executive Director of the Information Technology Office, also spoke at the event. He highlighted the importance of Thai cuisine as one of the key factors that attracts visitors from all over the world, and thanked the Thailand Foundation and the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration for their support.

6051,"Baroness Worthington is a veteran environmental campaigner who has worked for various charities including Friends of the Earth. Earlier in the month she was appointed shadow energy minister. Then she astounded and dismayed several of her fellow environmentalists by publicly declaring her support for fracking. She has not done so without qualification and insists that the introduction of it must be conditional, but she no longer sees fracking as the unequivocal danger that many others, including myself, do. She urges her fellow greens to ""think again"" and ""keep a cool head"". Her reasons for her position are very predictable; she says: ""We have the mother of all challenges- getting emissions of greenhouse gases out of our energy system. Environmentalists should not be adopting a priori objections to technologies but appraising them... We have to be realistic. We are going to be using gas for a long time because of the huge role it plays for heating homes and for industry. The important thing is to minimize the carbon emissions from gas. That means if we can get our own fracked gas, it's better to use that than importing gas that's been compressed at great energy cost somewhere else."" Baroness Worthington is taking a softer line than some of the other ""new greens"". She will not back fracking unless it's accompanied by ""CCS- carbon capture and storage"". This is a system where carbon dioxide gas, or Carbon™ as it is known today, is removed from the exhaust of fossil fuel-burning appliances and prevented from entering the atmosphere. There are various ways to do this; the Carbon™ can be put into chemical compounds for industry and agriculture or buried underground in old mines, bonded chemically to certain kinds of rock, or in depleted oil wells. Some of her peers are not so contemplative over fracking and are saying nothing except ""full steam ahead!"" This is because shale gas has comparatively low Carbon™ emissions compared to other fossil fuels. Already the power generation infrastructure in Britain is being shifted from coal to gas; we've seen this at Didcot Power Station. Didcot A has been demolished and replaced by a gas-fired plant, see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpZqN-orAjk. Currently all of this gas is being imported from the Middle East, therefore Ms Worthington thinks we should instead be exploiting our own gas deposits. Most of her peers in Friends of the Earth and the Green Party oppose anything except a single stage transformation in energy generation from fossil fuels to renewables. Craig Bennett of FoE said: ""Fracking won't help us tackle climate change. Even people in the industry agree that shale gas wouldn't make any big difference to our energy sector until the mid-to-late 2020's, which is exactly when the UK needs to start getting out of gas, wherever it comes from. Building a whole new gas infrastructure will keep us addicted to expensive fossil fuels for decades to come."" (Source: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-34191713) I suspect the pressures which led Baroness Worthington to make her statement are part of a larger and more strategic movement within environmental politics. Environmental activists have changed in recent years. Rather than having beards and woolly hats they wear smarts suits and ties; and they no longer sail boats into the paths of whaling ships. Instead they sit in locked boardrooms and speak in hushed voices. They have a Punch and Judy puppet cast of useful idiots to stand in front of the media and explain how nuclear power isn't all that bad and GMO crops are necessary to prevent starvation. Examples I've talked about before are Mark Lynas, see: http://hpanwo-voice.blogspot.co.uk/2015/01/2015-and-climate-change.html, George Monbiot, see: http://hpanwo-voice.blogspot.co.uk/2011/02/death-to-climate-change-deniers.html, and Sir David Attenborough, see: http://hpanwo-voice.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/bbc-horizon-why-most-of-us-need-to-die.html. Fracking has now been added to that list of things environmentalists used to be united in their opposition to for perfectly rational reasons, but now are grudgingly accepting because of hysteria over climate change. The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference is beginning in Paris at the end of November so statements like Baroness Worthington's are a strike on a very hot iron. Of course I think she's deeply mistaken and irresponsible even to suggest fracking could be anything but a disaster, see background links below. As researchers like Ian R Crane and Richard D Hall have explained, the agenda behind fracking, when you get to its fundamentals, is not really one of energy. The supposed ""shale gas rush"" is actually a huge bubble; the government have exaggerated the amount of gas available many-fold in order to lure investors, and bribe MP's and other officials. Also the ""War on Terra"" dictates a global scorched earth policy; the toxic gas and chemicals introduced into the biosphere by fracking will achieve that. The good news is that since Baroness Worthington was appointed shadow energy minister a new Leader of the Opposition has been elected, see: http://hpanwo-voice.blogspot.co.uk/2015/09/the-corbinator-wins.html. Jeremy Corbyn is luckily very much against fracking and will hopefully soon send Ms Worthington swiftly back to her evening church hall meetings.

3013,"UTA students joined thousands of protesters at Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Dallas on Monday. 

Protesters walked about a mile and a half from the Cathedral Shrine of the Virgin of Guadalupe on Ross Avenue to Trump’s rally in the American Airlines Center. They held up signs opposing Trump, American flags and Donald Trump piñatas while some yelled ""Stop the hate,"" and ""Si se puede."" 

Domingo Garcia, attorney and president of League of United Latin American Citizens in Dallas, helped organize the protest to send a message to Donald Trump and the Republican Party. 
 
“Messages of hate, intolerance and bigotry are not welcome in Dallas, Texas,” Garcia said. “We believe in the values that are enshrined on the Statue of Liberty and our bill of rights: Inclusion, tolerance and being a country of immigrants.” 

Public Relations senior Christopher Enriquez said the U.S. immigration system is broken, and Trump’s plan to deport 11 million immigrants is impractical. 

“We’re saying we are not going to be silenced,” he said. ""They ask the people to go back to Mexico, or their country of origin. People can't just leave what they've built for years just to go back and apply and maybe come back 10 years later."" 

Dianne Bellard, Trump rally attendee, said Trump is just saying what everyone’s thinking. 

“He’s for immigration, but just not illegal. I love the fact of immigration but I don’t love the fact of just walking across and taking our money,” she said.  

She said she supports Trump building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, and thinks welfare should be cut to help fund it. 

“We’re gonna have to do some welfare cuts, but I’m tired of seeing all the people go out with their bling-bling nails and their tattoos and trading their EBT cards for money so they can buy drugs, and TVs and cowboy gear, you name it,” she said. 

Nursing sophomore Tobias Gaucin found out about the protest on Facebook. 

“It’s personal. He’s talking about my family. My parents came here to have a better life,” he said. “For him to call them murderers and rapists and drug dealers, that’s just not right.” 
 
Victor Ibarra, a Mexican immigrant, has been in the U.S. for more than 20 years, and is currently going through the process to become a resident, he said. 

“It makes me feel like an animal,” he said. “I feel like garbage. The testimony that Trump says is that we are bad people. I have never been to jail. I'm not a criminal. I've never been in drugs. He’s making a racial profile with the Mexican community.” 

Andrew Rokovich, is the owner and operator of Double Dave’s Pizza Works in Victoria, TX and the president of Texas Young Republican’s Federation in Victoria. He said he’s never supported a candidate as much as he supports Trump. 

“I’m a believer in borders, language and culture, and obviously that’s kind of his pillars,” he said. “I really think he’s going to strengthen our culture.”

3880,"(CNN) – Donald Trump has torn through his Republican presidential opponents, but now he has a new nemesis: Miss Alabama. 

Meg McGuffin finished as the “fourth runner up” in the Miss America 2016 pageant on Sunday night. 

But it was her shot at Trump — who she said should leave the GOP “absolutely terrified” — that provided the most memorable moment of her pageant appearance. 

During the competition, Miss America judge Taya Kyle, the widow of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, asked McGuffin to weigh in on Trump’s surge to the front of the Republican presidential pack. 

“I think Donald Trump is an entertainer, and I think he says what’s on a lot of peoples’ minds,” she said. 

“But I think the Republican Party should be absolutely terrified of all the attention that he is taking from incredible candidates like Jeb Bush and Chris Christie who could absolutely do the job of president of the United States.” 

McGuffin’s assessment of Trump as an “entertainer” isn’t far out of line with what some of Trump’s rivals — and even the real estate mogul himself — have said recently. 

Last week, Trump defended comments about GOP contender Carly Fiorina’s face by saying that “some comments are made as an entertainer.”

 10 questions for Civil War spy expert Karen Abbott  
 September 17, 2015 Tess Malone  
 Photo by Nick Barose 
In historian Karen Abbott’s newest book,  Liar, Temptress, Soldier, Spy , we meet four women who defied gender expectations and their respective governments to spy during the Civil War. Before her lecture  at the Margaret Mitchell House tonight, she discussed diving into the Civil War from a Yankee perspective, what she’s working on now, and her favorite places in Atlanta. 
 
As a New York–based writer, was it daunting to tackle the Civil War? 
It really was. I lived in Atlanta for six years.  When I first moved down there, it was a huge culture shock. The Civil War seeps into the Southern culture more than Northern. I was stuck in traffic on 400 and saw a pickup truck with a bumper sticker that said, “Don’t blame me; I voted for Jeff Davis.” Driving behind this pickup for two hours got me thinking about the Civil War. In my mind I always go to: What were the women doing? What were the “bad” women doing? 

 
What was the research process like? 
I sort of has to start at the beginning and remind myself who the generals were and refresh myself on the battles. And no one agrees on the details. What was the Civil War about—nobody even has a consensus on that. What people omit or choose to omit is as interesting as what the truth is. The idea of self-mythology in the Civil War was interesting to me. Everyone who wrote about themselves engaged in some embellishment and some self-aggrandizing. Writing it was a five-year process. I had to write as I was researching or I would’ve been researching forever. 
 
Your book is incredibly detailed, so did you pick the four women based on their stories or your access to primary sources? 
Number one it was primary sources. I like to read nonfiction that reads like a novel, so it's a question of how many primary resources would I have to draw from. Luckily, the four women I picked were prolific writers: Rose and Belle had memoirs; Emma wrote her books, so you could see where she was embellinshing and where she was being factual; but Elizabeth was the best spy, and like any good spy didn’t want to leave too much of trail so she wasn’t caught. I wanted women who were coming at war from different perspectives and had different motivations. I wanted women whose stories would intersect and affect each other; for example, Rose’s spying affects Emma. Their stories were interwined in interesting ways. 
 
How did these women defy both 19th century and contemporary gender stereotypes? 
Elizabeth Van Lew was Ulysses S. Grant’s most important spy. He definitely needed her input to win war. The fact she’s not a household name is such a tragedy to me. If she had been man, he probably would be a household name.  The gender fluidity about them is fascinating to me. Belle was a seductress but occasionally dressed like a man, carried her own weapons, and got into altercations. If Sarah Palin and Miley Cyrus had a 19th-century baby, it would be Belle. Make what you will of her politics, but I really admired her brazenness. With Emma, her gender fluidity was intriguing because she was living as a man but allowed herself to develop romantic feelings for another soldier. It's her mixture of strength and vulnerability. I didn’t want it to be women running around in skirts. This was bloody. This was devastating. I wanted the blood and guts to be evident. 
 
Despite how your books are historical nonfiction, they read like novels. What's your writing background? 
I am not an academic. My background was in journalism. My favorite thing to do was to write really long profile pieces, taking something small and blowing it up. I remember taking a name out of phone book of this poor woman and writing a whole feature. My editor gave me the freedom to explore mundane topics, which honed my storytelling ability. With journalism, it’s all about the detail. You can’t try to be funny, charming, or poignant; you have to let those details do the work for you. 
 
How did you switch from journalism to historical nonfiction? 
I was in Philly, and I was getting burned out. I had the horrible task of reporting on all of the layoffs and buyouts at the  Inquirer . I was constantly reading about the attrition. Around that time, my husband got a transfer to Atlanta, so it was a good time to see something new and try book-length writing. I had an idea and spent two to three years on it, and it didn’t sell. Being on submission for the first time was one of the worst experiences. I blew up in hives. 
 
What are you working on next? 
I am working on a magazine piece that might turn into book on a modern day murder. If not that, I’m going to start diving into novel. 
 
Who are your favorite writers? 
Gary Smith was a Sports Illustrated journalist. His magazine pieces are never just about sports; they give you an insight into an experience. I recommend Beyond the Game . 
 
I have to ask about the parrots mentioned in your author bio. 
I have two African Greys, Edgar Allan Poe and Pete Dexter.  They’re excellent mimics but crap on my files. They’re great company. 
 
As a former Atlantan, what are your favorite places in the city? 
Cakes & Ale , I used to love the Clermont Lounge and  Majestic Diner .

3463,"In 1984, Arizona State University’s Department of Journalism and Telecommunication was elevated from department to school status and named the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Telecommunication. In 2006, PBS’ American Masters profiled the namesake CBS newsman as a “Witness to History.” Tomorrow night, at the outset of this new school year, the twain shall meet in the form of a screening of the PBS documentary as part of “Cronkite Night at the Movies.” The Sept. 2 kick-off selection will be introduced by Cronkite School senior associate dean Marianne Barrett and faculty professor Louise Solheim. When Cronkite passed away in 2009, PBS chatted with the documentary’s director, Catherine Tatge. Among her observations: Q: What did you learn from interviewing Cronkite’s contemporaries? A: A really important point in this documentary is how reporters like Cronkite, and all the other greats I interviewed, were mostly people who came out of print journalism. They were real reporters. And that transition from print to television gave them an understanding of how to find and present a great story. Their print background is reflected in the language they use in their reporting. There’s real writing there. These days, the news media often has to remind readers that so-and-so is not Walter Cronkite. To wit: “Jorge Ramos Is Not Walter Cronkite” “Megyn Kelly Is Not Walter Cronkite” Correct, and correct. There was, and only ever will be, one.

Australia may shut down Chris Brown. 

He may not go downtown. 

He won't get around. 

Unlike kangaroos, he won't bound. 

He won't hit the clubs to get down. 

He won't be able to sing a sound. 

He won't ... 

Sorry. I couldn't help myself. 

Anyway, Chris Brown may have to skip a scheduled Australian tour in December, as officials from the country apparently have a problem with guys convicted of beating up Rihanna. 

TMZ quotes an immigration official saying, ""People need to understand if you are going to commit domestic violence and then you want to travel around the world, there are going to be countries that say to you, 'You cannot come in because you are not of the character we expect in Australia.'"" 

In this July 25, 2015 file photo, Chris Brown performs at a club in Macau.  (AP Photo/Kin Cheung, File) 

Wow. Chris Brown isn't even welcome in a country full of people descended from prisoners. 

Australia's prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, reportedly agreed with the immigration statement, saying it was ""brilliantly expressed."" 

Brown's tour is scheduled to hit Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. TMZ reports that Australia hasn't officially denied Brown's visa yet, which has already happened in Britain, Canada and New Zealand. 

Anti-violence advocates have lobbied hard to have the government deny Brown's entry.

Flying on an airplane is pretty exciting no matter what, but you know what’s even better? When you roll up to the terminal and see that your plane is actually cool and colorful. It doesn’t happen all the time, but every now and then an airline will give a pretty awesome makeover to one of its fleet, and then you’re flying high in the sky in style. Now, ANA Airlines has just unveiled the best decorated planes to date: they’ve got Star Wars planes, you guys. 

ANA Airlines is a Japanese airline, so if we want to fly inside a giant plane decorated like R2D2, we’ve sadly got to fly to Japan first to then fly on R2D2. But listen, it’ll be worth it.

2364,"The new iPhones arrived in force and already a sales success story, showing that Apple returned to hit full on their formula for success. However, and beyond these figures, there have been some problems with these new equipment. The latest is associated with a bug in iOS 9 and allocating the motion sensors of the iPhone 6s. This problem is affecting only new iPhones 6S and was discovered by those who try to use applications that use the sensors of the new M9 motion co-processor. This happened to be now included in the SoC A9 processor from Apple and serves as the interface between the operating system and the different sensors that equip the iPhone 6S. The problem is reflected in the inability to use applications that make use of data from the various motion sensors, and in particular InvenSense gyro six axes and the accelerometer Bosch Sensortec three axes. When sensors that these are intended to be used fail to transpose the data and applications are left with strange behavior, making it impossible to use. The problem is, for now, contained the new iPhone models and appear to affect only third-party applications that try to use these sensors. Any of the Apple applications that make use of these sensors, such as maps, do not have these problems and also older iPhone models do not seem to be affected for the problem. The problem was first discovered in the application Sky Guide, which uses these sensors to display on the iPhone screen a map of the stars that adjusts according to the user’s movement. The team that developed this application addresses the problem to an implementation with failures iOS API 9th Gathering M9 coprocessor information. This team is also trying to find a solution to this problem, returning the possibility of using the Sky Guide in the new iPhones. But it’s not just this application that is experiencing this problem. Several programmers, responsible for other similar and that make use of the iPhone motion sensors applications are to complain of it. From what has been possible to ascertain, this is not an exclusive problem of the iOS 9 and even the latest version, 1.9, is showing the same behavior. It is also the first time that this problem arises in iPhones. Already in 2013, at the launch of iPhone 5s, there was a similar situation at the time was attributed to lack of calibration of the new accelerometer Bosch now being used. So far, and how is normal in these situations, Apple has not yet issued any comments or additional information about the problem. It is expected very soon news that should come in the form of an update to iOS and that should correct the problem.",3f9a848a-f602-437f-9d3d-594695490a3c,Blog,2015-09-29T07:49:29Z,Information Technology Current News,Failure iOS 9 commits motion sensors of the iPhone 6s – Pplware,1.0,Blog

5752,"My family and I recently spent a week along the Oregon coast, where we hiked, biked, and — of course — did some math.

While on a hike through Ecola State Park, we had this view of the Tillamook Rock Lighthouse, a structure 62 feet tall that stands atop an offshore island:



Never one to resist the opportunity to pose a math question, I asked my sons, ""How far do you think it is from here to the lighthouse?"" My sons — never ones to resist reading the informational placard at a trailhead — already knew the answer and quickly responded, ""About 1.2 miles.""

Ah, hell no. I'm itching for a mathy conversation, damn it, and you're not getting off that easy! So I then asked, ""How far do you think it is from here to the horizon?"" Luckily, the answer to that question hadn't been included in the display at the bottom of the hill.

Eli used proportional reasoning. He extended his arm and measured the distance from the shore to the lighthouse between his thumb and index finger; then, he used that same unit to measure the distance from the lighthouse to the horizon. ""I'd guess about 2 miles,"" he said. ""It's farther from here to the lighthouse than from the lighthouse to the horizon.""

Alex used intuition. ""I think it's a little farther,"" he said. ""Maybe three miles?""

""Actually,"" I said, ""it's much farther than that. I won't tell you how much farther, but I will help you figure it out."" (Typing that last sentence makes me realize that having a constructivist father is not an easy burden to bear. My answer to most questions is usually another question.)

After much discussion, we finally concluded that we were about 90 feet above sea level. Estimating vertical distance, it turns out, is not an easy task, especially for eight-year-olds. But once we agreed, the rest of the math was more or less straightforward. The image below provides a reasonable model for the situation:

In that model,

	h = height above sea level of the observer
	R = radius of the Earth
	x = the straight-line distance to the horizon from the observer

The sight line of the observer is a tangent line to the circle, and the point of tangency is the horizon that the observer sees. Consequently, a right angle is formed by the tangent line and radius. We now have a right triangle with which to work, so we can lean on the Pythagorean theorem. But first we'll need some numbers.

At the Tillamook Rock Lighthouse, we had the following numbers:

	h = 90 feet (estimated)
	R = 4,000 miles (give or take)

And x, of course, is the unknown distance to the horizon that we are trying to find.

This leads to the following:

$latex \begin{array}{rcl}

x^2 + R^2 & = &(R + h)^2 \\

x^2 + 20\,000\,000^2 & = &(20\,000\,000 + 100)^2 \\

x^2 & = &40\,000\,010\,000 \\

x & \approx &62\,000 \, \textrm{feet} \end{array} $

A rough estimate of the Earth's radius in feet is 4,000 × 5,000 = 20,000,000, which is why that number appears in the equations above. Two things should be noted here. First, using 5,000 for the number of feet in a mile instead of the more accurate but less friendly 5,280 allows for easier calculations throughout. Second, we're only looking for an estimate of the distance to the horizon, so we should feel free to take some liberties with the numbers if it'll help with computation.

Using 20,000,000 instead of 4,000 allows feet to be used as the units throughout, so the answer obtained at the end (x = 62,000) is also in feet. To find the distance to the horizon in miles, we'll need to divide by 5,000, which gives:
62,000 ÷ 5,000 = 12.4 miles
Now that's all well and good, and the boys were amazed that the horizon is so far away. But what if you want to generalize to find the distance to the horizon from any height above sea level?

The answer depends on the math, boating, or physics book you choose to reference.

One possibility is to use this graph, which we discovered a few days later while visiting the Yaquina Head Lighthouse:

[caption id=""attachment_5784"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""455""] Graph at the Yaquina Head Lighthouse, Newport, OR[/caption]

It shows the distance to the horizon on the horizontal axis and the feet above sea level on the vertical axis, which I suppose makes sense from a visual perspective; but it's more conventional to put the independent variable (feet) on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable (miles) on the vertical axis. Nonetheless, the information provided by the graph is still useful, and it nicely shows that the relationship between height and distance to the horizon is clearly not linear.

On the other hand, if you search for ""distance to horizon formula"" online, you'll find any of the following formulas:

$latex \begin{array}{rcl}

d & = &\sqrt{1.5h} \\

d & = &\sqrt{\frac{7h}{4}} \\

d & = & 1.17\sqrt{h} \\

d & = &R\times\arccos\bigl({\frac{R}{R+h}\bigr)}

\end{array} $

The differences are due to whether miles or nautical miles are used, as well as whether you'd like to account for the refraction of light, which greatly influences the distance an observer would be able to see. Personally, I prefer the first formula for its simplicity, but you're free to use whichever one you like.

Sadly, I don't know a single joke involving the horizon. (Do you? Post in the comments.) So I'll leave you instead with a quote about the horizon:
Make the horizon your goal. It will always be ahead of you.

Elliott was trapped in the truck and pronounced dead at the scene. He was not wearing a seatbelt, ac-cording to the Florida Highway Patrol media release. Several firearms were located in the truck, including two loaded pistols, one shotgun and one loaded AR-15 rifle.

GLAXO ""soborna"" de nuevo...ahora Polonia, Jordania, Líbano... The latest allegations say GSK paid Romanian doctors hundreds, and in one cases thousands, of euros between 2009 and 2012 for prescribing its medicines, including prostate treatments Avodart and Duodart and Parkinson's disease drug Requip. 
According to the email, the doctors were notionally paid for speaking engagements, but in three out of six cases, including the most highly paid one, they did not give any speech. The other three medics gave only one speech each, despite receiving multiple payments. 
GSK also provided doctors with many international trips and made payments to them under the guise of participation in advisory boards, the email said. 
The company said it would look ""very thoroughly"" into the claims, which cover a period before its pledge in December 2013 to stop paying doctors to speak on its behalf or to attend international conferences. 
 “We do receive letters of this sort from time to time. We welcome and support the opportunity for people to speak up if they have any concerns,"" GSK said in a statement. ""Sometimes we do find things and we act on it; sometimes our findings do not substantiate the matters being raised."" 
The China scandal, which involved alleged bribes totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, hit GSK's sales in the country, although Chief Executive Andrew Witty, reporting quarterly results on Wednesday, said its Chinese business was stabilizing.

Among these companies was Roche, which has confirmed that its offices were searched and that it is cooperating fully with the authorities.

The list includes Roche Romania, subsidiary of Swiss multinational Roche, as well as Actavis, Pfizer Romania, Teva Pharmaceuticals Romania, Novartis Pharma Services, Alvogen Romania, Sandoz Pharma Services, Glaxosmithkline Romania, Egis Internațional, drug distributor Romastru Trading and drug producer Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, according to judicial sources quoted by Agerpres.

Companies paid for the doctors’ travels to international medical conventions as well as leisure trips to other countries.

In return, the investigated doctors prescribed the drugs produced or distributed by these companies, instead of generic drugs, which are cheaper, but have similar effects.

The designers in question are sisters Nurul, Mira and Syera Zulkifli, founders of Malaysian brand Mimpikita, which made its LFW debut on Sunday night.
The Zulkifli sisters celebrate their London Fashion Week debut on Sunday
Mimpikita is already stocked in London boutiques and the sisters are reportedly in talks with online retail giant ASOS. At home in Kuala Lumpur, the family are style icons (hailed as Malaysia's more modest answer to the Kardashians) - with two stores of their own, a seven figure turnover and a social media following in excess of 120,000.
The Zulfiki sisters wear hijabs and so do some of their models - a choice the Zulfikis say has been faced with some resistance from Asian fashion media, especially when featuring models in hijabs in publications targeted at a non-muslim audience. But they're keen for the brand to be embraced by women universally: ""For my sisters and I, it's all about removing the old ideologies and stereotypes that prevent us from having it all,"" Mira Zulkifli said.
""For us there is no stronger illustration of our pride in our faith than us as designers taking to the runway in our hijabs after the models.""
Mimpikita S/S 16 collection
Speaking exclusively to HuffPost UK Style following their LFW debut on Sunday night, the Zulkifli sisters were keen to start a positive debate around the hijab in fashion.
Do you think there needs to be more diversity in fashion?
Most definitely, there is plenty of work to be done in terms of featuring models and designers from the varied backgrounds and different faiths.
What changes would you like to see made?
Hailing from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, with a multi-racial society, we’re blessed to be accepted as muslim young entreprenuers and have never faced with any racial stigma.
Moving forward, with our plans of international expansion. We are aware of the possibility of the racial divide that we might face, but we strongly believe a creative industry like fashion should reflect our society and the many cultures there are from all over the world. SEE ALSO:

What made you choose to feature models wearing hijabs?
Our aim is to encourage modest clothing in updated styles, which showcase the wide array of cultures present in Kuala Lumpur.
Being hijab wearers ourselves, we’re comfortable and proud of our personal styles so it’s no surprise that we love featuring models in chic, modest clothing. And in addition to that, we hope to represent and promote diversity in the fashion industry.
Do you think hijabs should be talked about as fashion item as well as religious item – or would that be disrespectful? What does wearing the hijab mean to you?
Primarily, as muslims - there is an obligation for us to be modest in all that we do and that includes what we wear. Choosing to wear the hijab isn’t supposed to create more stress on women, and nor is it the climax of our spirituality.
For us sisters, our commitment to wearing the hijab is a big part of our lives – it grounds us and helps us to maintain our modesty.
Our hijab styles are also fairly simple; sticking to neutrals and a simple ‘pin & tuck’ style to compliment our outfits and personal style. The many hijab styles out there can be tapered to match someone’s own style reference and although there is incessant debate on the hijab as fashion item, we view it as providing an opportunity for women to partake in fashion trends, while creating a niche market for those who choose to cover up.
Models on the Mimpikita S/S 16 catwalk
What’s been the biggest challenge for your fashion brand?
To master our style and keeping true to our brand identity regardless of our faith.
With the amount of new designers and brands coming up, the reality for us today is that there’s a very short window for us to develop. We hope our debut at London Fashion Week showcased what Mimpikita really is about – pushing boundaries and tradition.

A shareholder agreement for a gas pipeline to be extended from Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea has been signed. 
 
Gazprom, Royal Dutch Shell, E.ON, BASF, ENGIE and OMV agreed on the amount of shares they will own in the Nord Stream II project. 
 
The Russian gas giant has the biggest stake (51%) in the project while the rest own 10% each apart from ENGIE, which owns 9%. 
 
The Nord Stream II  project will consist of two additional pipelines that could transport up to 55 billion cubic meters of gas. 
 
It will be developed by joint venture project firm New European Pipeline AG. 
 
Alexey Miller, CEO of Gazprom said: “Nord Stream II will double the throughput of our up-to-date non-transit route via the Baltic Sea. It is important that those are the new gas volumes, which will be sought for in Europe due to the continuous decline in its domestic production.

Internet of Things (IOT) Working Group Provides Easily Understandable Recommendations for Securely Implementing and Deploying IoT Solutions

LAS VEGAS 

The IoT introduces the need to manage exponentially more identities than existing IAM systems are required to support. The security industry is seeing a paradigm shift whereby IAM is no longer solely concerned with managing people but also managing the hundreds of thousands of ""things"" that may be connected to a network. In many instances these things are connected intermittently and may be required to communicate with other things, mobile devices and the backend infrastructure. 

""This document is the first in a series of summary guidance aimed at providing easily understandable recommendations to information technology staff charged with securely implementing and deploying IoT solutions,"" said Brian Russell 

To help security practitioners ensure the integrity of their IoT deployments, the report details 23 recommendations for implementing IAM for IoT which are drawn from real-world best practices culled by CSA's IoT Working Group along with guidance from a number of other organizations including the Kantara Initiative, FIDO, and the IETF. Some of these recommendations include:

4323,"GOVERNMENT is finally engaging ZESA Holdings over the proposed takeover of interest on a Federation-era debt to Zambia, the Financial Gazette's Companies &Markets (C&M) can report. The interest had ballooned to US$114,8 million. 

The development comes after ZESA Holdings, through the Ministry of Energy and Power Development, last year requested that the interest payable be transferred to government as the liability was a government-to-government debt. 

But for some reasons, more than a year after the request, government had not responded to the appeal. 

The interest emanates from a US$70,8 million debt to Zambia which Zimbabwe inherited after taking over power generation assets that had been shared between the two countries. 

The debt was for the shared cost of the Kariba Dam construction and associated infrastructure during the tenure of Central African Power Corporation (CAPCO), a power firm jointly owned by the governments of Zimbabwe and Zambia when they were still part of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, which was dissolved in 1963. 

It also included the sale of assets belonging to CAPCO. 

Now, secretary for the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, Willard Manungo, revealed to C&M that talks are underway. 

""We are now in discussions with ZESA over the interest component,"" said Manungo, adding: ""Check with me in the coming few weeks, we should have a position over this matter."" 

C&M was the first to report on the interest payment which was due for payment last year. 

The interest component was ratified by an inter-governmental committee of officials representing Zimbabwe and Zambia governments in February last year at a meeting in Livingstone. 

Finance Minister, Patrick Chinamasa, was part of that meeting. 

Chinamasa was then requested by his Zambian counterpart to come up with a proposal on the interest payment schedule. 

It was, however, not immediately clear whether Chinamasa had come up with the schedule or not. 

Given the weight of debt the power utility is currently carrying, there are fears that ZESA could be forced to take the interest component into its books, a situation which would worsen the pressure on the integrated power generation and distribution company which has clearly struggled to service its foreign debts. 

In May last year, the Ministry of Energy and Power Development wrote to Chinamasa, saying: ""Interest on the ex-CAPCO debt was agreed at US$114,827,778 by the two governments (of Zimbabwe and Zambia) through an established Council of Ministers. 

Finance Minister, Patrick Chinamasa 

""The position of the Ministry of Energy and Power Development is that the responsibility to pay the interest on the government of Zambia debt rests with the government of Zimbabwe as the liability is a government to government debt. 

""This position was communicated to the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development in a letter written to them on May, 29, 2014 and a formal response has not yet been received. 

""It is the Ministry of Energy and Power Development's expectation that the liability for the interest will be accepted by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development."" 

CAPCO was running the Kariba power project for the two countries but was disbanded in 1987, and was succeeded by the Zimbabwe River Authority. 

Its assets were distributed to national power companies in the two countries, which are ZESA Holdings and Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO). 

After distribution of the assets, the government of Zimbabwe owed the government of Zambia US$70,807,000. 

The amount remained outstanding, and Zimbabwe in February 2012 signed a new acknowledgement of debt with a payment plan. 

Government then transferred the debt to ZESA Holdings as it was the beneficiary of the distributed assets. 

ZESA Holdings was, however, pressured to pay the principal amount after Zambia threatened to pull out of a deal for the two southern African countries to jointly construct the Batoka Gorge Hydro Power Station on the Zambezi River. 

Zimbabwe and Zambia in February 2012 signed a Memorandum of Understanding to jointly construct Batoka Gorge Hydro Power Station with each country expected to get 800 megawatts of electricity from the project, a development which would help boost power supply in the two southern African countries. 

The agreement on the Batoka project, situated about 54 kilometres downstream of Victoria Falls on the Zambezi River, was therefore dependent on Zimbabwe's commitment to pay off the US$70,8 million debt. 

Plans for the project were initially mooted in 1993, but the Zambian government was reluctant because of the outstanding debt which it wanted Zimbabwe to clear first. 

The power utility, which is wholly-owned by government, has already paid off the principal of about US$71 million in accordance with the payment schedule as per the settlement agreement of February 9, 2",73844457-4e78-4341-b25a-761e9e3df1a9,News,2015-09-10T12:21:28Z,Individual.com,Zesa's Debt Interest Poser,0.0,News

After long talks of transformation in Rugby that nearly prevented the Springboks from going to participate in the upcoming IRB Rugby World Cup, Lions coach Johan Ackermann has decided to name centre Howard Mnisi as the team captain ahead of their clash against Eastern Province Kings.

Mnisi will lead the side for the first in his career when they welcome EP Kings at the Emirates Airlines Park in their Absa Currie cup round four match. The 26 year old Mnisi, takes over the captaincy duties from Warren Whiteley, who was expected to lead the team upon his arrival from the Springboks,but was ruled out after he sustained a calf injury. The former Pumas centre Mnisi says he is excited to be given the captaincy role and he does not see his appointment as a result of the hotly debated transformation issue in the sport. “With all the talk around transformation, I can't get swept up in that. I need to focus on the team and play well,” Mnisi said. Mnisi sentiments were echoed by his coach Ackermann, who stated that the appointment of Mnisi had nothing to do with transformation as he treats his players with the same respect. “My players are chosen on merit, I'm proud to say that. Howard is my captain because of how he has been playing,” Ackermann said. Lions host EP Kings brimming with confidence, following their bonus point victory over Pumas in their last match and Ackermann has maintained they will continue with the same performances against seventh placed EP Kings side. “We sympathise with the Kings, but we need to prepare regardless. On the field it's all business and we can't let that affect us. We need to carry on as usual. The 45 year-old Ackermann has retained most of the players that did the business against Pumas last week, with Fabian Booysen shifting to No.8 to take Whiteley's place, while Kwagga Smith has been given a starting berth and Andries Coetzee starts at number 15. “It's great to have Andries Coetzee back at 15. He's an experienced player who brings stability and confidence.” The Johannesburg based outfit are currently topping the log with 20 points, tight with rivals Blue Bulls and they are firm favourites to win this clash against win-less Eastern Province based outfit.",dc8906e2-a7a5-41b5-b5bc-56ffe59f06d6,News,2015-09-04T08:20:56Z,The New Age Online,'My players are chosen on merit'-Ackermann,0.0,News

4615,"A six-level, 3391-square-metre building at 244-248 Flinders Street is offered with near total vacant possession 

﻿ 

Yooralla, the state's largest non-profit disability service provider, can expect at least $20 million – or 12 times what it paid 20 years ago – for a Melbourne CBD office opposite Flinders Street train station.

The six-level, 3391-square-metre former Yooralla headquarters at 244-248 Flinders Street, which is also opposite a tram super stop, is offered with near vacant possession, except for some small leases expiring in 2017.

In that period, a new owner could push through a major planning proposal for the 853-square-metre development-sensitive block, provided it did not block sunlight around the banks of the Yarra River.

At 108 Flinders Street, developers recently completed a 12-level, 191-unit building opposite Federation Square.

However, earlier this year, a proposal to replace airspace atop the Fletcher Jones building on the north-west corner of Flinders and Queen streets with a 26-level apartment tower was rejected by Planning Minister Richard Wynne.

Savills directors Clinton Baxter and Nick Peden​ are expecting local, interstate and offshore interest in the Yooralla site.

""This is an extremely well-located CBD building which offers exceptional upside,"" Mr Baxter said. ""It presents a tremendous value-add opportunity with a number of options including redevelopment, repositioning, owner-occupation and change of use.""

Mr Peden added that the tightly held precinct historically provided owners with solid rental and capital growth over a long-term period because of ever increasing residents and shopping traffic.

""City of Melbourne studies confirm this to be the busiest pedestrian location in Melbourne's CBD and one of the busiest in Australia, with over 10 million tourists visiting the immediate area annually.""

In 2001, the organisation then known as the Yooralla Society of Victoria quietly sold the historic estate it occupied in Flete Avenue, Armadale, for $7 million. The buyer, businessman David Crammond, sold his National Waste interest to Kerry Packer in the late 1980s.

Mr Crammond sold off a slice of the estate's yard for $2 million. In 2006, he traded the renovated period home for $14 million, setting an Armadale record.

A few weeks ago, one of the modern mansions developed on a small block around Yooralla's former building at 2-6 Flete Avenue was sold for more than $8 million.

Captain 

Mamuka Gorgodze

Life as the best European rugby team outside the Six Nations must be confusing at times. Georgia essentially do not lose competitive matches outside World Cups: they sealed their place at this one with almost insulting ease, winning nine of their 10 qualifiers and drawing the other in Romania, while coasting home in their five home games by an aggregate 179-49. In the European Nations Cup they have lost one of their last 26 matches, winning the rest. In all competitions, between the start of 2014 and June this year they played 17 matches, and won 14 of them.

Debut v Spain, Tbilisi, 22 Feb 2003 

Pts 120 Tries 24 Photograph: Lynne Cameron/PA And then, every four years, they get put in their place. In World Cups Georgia have lost 10 matches and won two, at the rate of one in each of the past two tournaments, scoring nine tries to their opponents’ 52. But this year they have set their sights on progress: from finishing fifth in their first World Cup group in 2003, and fourth twice since, they now have their eyes on third place in pool C, behind New Zealand and Argentina but above both Namibia – one of their previous victims – and Tonga.

Fortunately their preparation has been excellent – in fact their coach, the New Zealander Milton Haig, went so far as to call it “perfect”: they have not suffered any significant injuries, but they have also lost all their games. “It’s perfect because it puts us under pressure,” Haig said. “This is the best preparation for a World Cup that Georgia has ever had.”

Since arriving in England Georgia have lost all three of their warm-up matches against Newcastle Falcons, Canada and Japan.

The first defeat was fairly comprehensive, Falcons prevailing 27-7 (entertainingly the Georgians, who arrived in Newcastle after a 10-day training camp in Poland that featured regular sessions in a cryotherapy chamber cooled to minus 100C, thought Newcastle was frightfully chilly and requested extra blankets for their shivering substitutes), but the latter two were extremely close. Canada – on the back of a seven-game losing run – edged their match 16-15 at Esher before Japan, courtesy of Lelei Mafu’s last-minute try, prevailed 13-10 at Kingsholm, where Georgia play their first two pool games.

“They weren’t the results we wanted from our warm-up games but as long as the process is right, I’m a big believer that once the World Cup starts it will be a totally different kettle of fish,” said Haig. As a result Georgia have slipped three places to 16th in the world rankings, five behind Tonga but still four ahead of Namibia.

Georgia have threatened to take significant scalps in the past, without ever quite pulling off an upset. In Bordeaux in 2007 they led Ireland in the second half only to lose 14-10, and two years ago they enjoyed a 12-9 half-time lead against Argentina perhaps a little too much, going on to lose 29-18. RWC graphic When they last played Tonga, in Tbilisi last year, they were 9-6 ahead with 20 minutes to play, but faded to lose 23-9. This can all be seen as useful experience, and a handful of their players, such as Georgi Chkhaidze – who along with Merab Kvirikashvili, the nation’s record points-scorer, is appearing at his fourth World Cup – played in all those games.

Their presence will assist the squad’s more youthful members, who include Vasil Lobzhanidze, 19 precisely a week after the final pool game and on track to become the World Cup’s first ever 18-year-old. The nation’s great young prospect, though, is the 22-year-old centre Merab Sharikadze, whose talent was honed at Hartpury College in Gloucestershire and who now plays, as do many of his nation’s leading lights, in France, with Aurillac in the Pro D2. He, too, was given his chance in the national side by Haig at the age of 18, and has since matured into an impressive all-round forward.

The fulcrum of the side is the captain, Mamuka Gorgodze, a 6ft 5in back row who took up rugby aged 17 because basketball, even though he was very good at it, simply wasn’t physical enough. His rampaging performances have earned him the nickname Gorgodzilla, but he arrives after a tough debut season for Toulon, where he moved last year after nine seasons at Montpellier. After arriving in England this week, Gorgodze spoke about how relieved he was to be participating in the World Cup after missing much of the season with knee injuries. “It’s feeling very good and I am 100%,” he confirmed.

Haig must hope that his side’s preparations have indeed been perfect, as they must hit the ground running, with their ambitions relying on a positive result in their opening match, against Tonga. Argentina and a first ever meeting with New Zealand follow before their tournament – unless things go unexpectedly well – comes to a close with a game against Namibia in Exeter, where they will expect to win.

That, they hope, will be when the good times really start. In May, Georgia won the second-tier nations’ World Rugby Under-20 Trophy for the first time, earning a place among the major nations at next year’s World Under-20 Championship and further fuelling a sense of optimism about the national team’s future.

A third-place finish in their pool – bringing as it does automatic qualification to the next World Cup in Japan – would allow them to focus fully on long-term success. This year George Njaradze, the Georgian rugby union president, revealed a glimpse of his long-term ambitions when he bullishly announced: “I promise you that in 2019 Georgia will surprise the rugby world.” That, though, is for the future; for now, surprising Tonga would probably do.

6365,"Department of Pediatric Dentistry Lutheran Medical Center Resident’s Name: Amir Yavari                                                                                   Date: 09/2/2015 Article Title: Pit and Fissure Sealants: Scientific and Clinical Rationale (Chapter 32) Author(s): Martha H. Wells Journal: Pediatric Dentistry, Infancy Through Adolescence, 5th Ed Date: 2012 Major Topic: Type of Article: Background information and expert opinion Main Purpose: Provides expert with Key Points/Summary: -          Epidemiology: • By age 11 years, over 40% of children have had dental caries in their primary teeth, and over 20% have had caries in their permanent teeth. • Over 50% of third graders have experienced dental caries, ranging from 40% (Connecticut) to 75%(Arizona). • Approximately 23% of children have untreated primary tooth decay and 11% have untreated caries in the permanent dentition. • The prevalence of dental caries in primary teeth increased significantly from 24% to 28% for 2-5 y/o. • By age 17 years, nearly 78% of children have experienced tooth decay, and by age 19 years, approximately 10% have lost at least one permanent tooth to caries. • Pit and fissure morphology provides an environment for plaque retention and bacteria proliferation. -          Sealant Effectiveness: • Reduction of caries incidence in children and adolescents after one-time placement of resin-based sealants ranges from 86% at 1 year to 78% at 2 years to 58% at 4 years. • When reapplied as needed, sealants are effective in reducing occlusal caries incidence in permanent first molars of children with reductions of 76% at 4 years. • Sealants are retained well on primary molars at a rate of 74% to 96% at 1 year and 70% to 76% at almost 3 years. • Compared with teeth without sealants, teeth that receive sealants are less likely to receive subsequent restorative treatment. If restorative treatment is required, the time until the first restorative treatment is greater than that for unsealed molars, and the restoration is likely to be less extensive. -          How Sealants Work: • Three types of materials are used as sealants: resin, glass ionomer, and polyacid-modified resins. • The most commonly accepted material is the resin-based sealant due to superior retention rates compared with GI sealants. • Glass ionomer sealants have a different bonding mechanism. -          Filler content: • The theory is that unfilled sealants will penetrate deeper into the fissures because of their low viscosity, create longer resin tags, and therefore be better retained. Data from one study suggest that unfilled sealants are retained better. Also in unfilled sealant occlusal adjustment is not necessary. -          Fluoride releasing Sealants: • Based on the knowledge of the benefits of fluoride release from GI materials, dental manufacturers have also developed fluoride-releasing resin sealants. However, studies have shown that salivary fluoride levels are the same before and after sealant placement, and there is no long-lasting release of fluoride to plaque and saliva. Additionally, clinical studies have not demonstrated significant caries prevention of fluoride-releasing sealants over those benefits obtained from conventional sealants. -          Which teeth? • Traditionally, noncarious first and second permanent molars with deep fissures were the candidates for sealants. -          Sealant over the incipient caries: • Sealants are applied properly and are monitored periodically, caries arrest beneath a sealant. Sealant application significantly decreases the viable bacteria in pits and fissures. Acid etching alone eliminates 75% of the viable microorganisms. It reduces the number of carious lesions that progress. -          Using bonding Agents: • Bond strength is significantly greater when a bonding agent is used with sealant rather than placing sealant alone on clean enamel. Hypomineralized teeth need to be re-treated with sealant application after a much shorter time. -          School-based sealant program: • An important and effective public health approach that complements clinical care systems in promoting the oral health of children and adolescents Assessment of Article:  Level of Evidence/Comments: Level III",44ade55f-ecbc-413f-b157-a00b7ab4a777,Blog,2015-09-02T02:21:07Z,St. Joseph Literature Review,Pit and Fissure Sealants: Scientific and Clinical Rationale,1.0,Blog

2169,"TORONTO -- The Liberal cabinet has bypassed Ontario's opposition parties and appointed Barbara Finlay as the province's temporary ombudsman. 
 
The New Democrats had blocked Liberal motions in the legislature to give the job to Finlay, who was deputy ombudsman, until the three parties could agree on a permanent candidate. 
 
The NDP wanted to give Andre Marin another extension while he applied for a third, five-year term as the government watchdog, but the Liberals refused so Marin's term expired at midnight. 
 
Government house leader Yasir Naqvi wrote his Progressive Conservative and New Democrat counterparts saying it is ""absolutely unacceptable"" for the ombudsman's position to be vacant for even one day. 
 
Naqvi says the government had to appoint the deputy as the temporary ombudsman until the parties can agree on a permanent candidate because the NDP was ""playing politics."" 
 
Marin held a news conference Monday to appeal for reappointment, and criticized the Liberals for politicizing the hiring practice and treating him unfairly as he reapplied for the job. 
 
""Unfortunately there's no ombudsman for ombudsman because I'd be knocking on that door,"" Marin told reporters. 
 
The three parties did agree on a new environmental commissioner for Ontario, appointing lawyer Dianne Saxe to a five-year term.

4382,"Each time the murder of her mother at Quaker's Hill nursing home resurfaces in a court room, so do Elly Valkay's nightmares, stress and tension. 

Ms Valkay's mother Neeltje Valkay was one of 11 nursing home patients who died after their carer Roger Dean lit two fires on November 18, 2011 at the facility in Sydney's west. 

Dean, a registered nurse of 15 years, set the place alight after he discovered police were investigating his theft of 200 prescription pills from the home. 

The 39-year-old is now appealing the 11 life sentences meted out to him in 2013 over the murders. 

Ms Valkay labelled the appeal as ""ridiculous"" and said it was yet another hurdle for her to cross. 

""We were hoping that after the inquest, that we would get back to a bit of a stable routine but I heard about the appeal about a month ago and out comes the sedatives, out comes the sleeping pills. 

""The tension, the stress is so great just because he wants what he wants, and there is no consideration for the victims and the families and that is what hurts,"" she told reporters outside court on Monday. 

Dean, the Court of Criminal Appeal heard, is appealing his sentences on a number of grounds. 

They include that they were manifestly excessive and that Justice Megan Latham - now the ICAC commissioner - erred in concluding it was not possible to reflect Dean's culpability with any penalty less than life imprisonment. 

His barrister Tim Game SC argued Dean had pleaded guilty and that the ""whole structure"" of the sentence was incorrect. 

""You can't say, `X is for this, X is for this and it has got so large it now has to be a life sentence',"" he submitted. 

But crown prosecutor Maria Cinque said 11 vulnerable people were murdered ""with the person responsible for their care, responsible for their deaths"". 

Comparisons to other crimes where offenders were given life sentences ""don't exist"", she added. 

Dean, she reminded the court, had lit a fire in a room where he knew two immobile and helpless residents - Dorothy Sterling and Dorothy Wu - were sleeping. 

When another resident saw the fire and begged him ""Please help them get out"", Dean replied: ""Don't worry darling you come with me, someone else will come and get them."" 

But Dean failed to tell firefighters battling his first blaze about this second one, and by the time it was discovered, the ""catastrophic"" blaze in Ms Sterling and Ms Wu's room was 10 metres high. 

Paul Cachia, whose mother Emmanuela Cachia was seriously injured in the blaze and died two and a half months later, said ""what gives him the right to appeal after what he did to our loved ones?"" 

""He should be lit up 11 times for what he done to those people,"" he told reporters. 

The decision on the appeal will be handed down at a later date.",341d7e29-796d-47c5-bac8-f412439bd769,News,2015-09-07T05:16:02Z,Countryman,Families lash out at Roger Dean's appeal,0.0,Blog
3394,"The trial of former Hey Dad! star Robert Hughes was not fair because he was the subject of ""poisonous and vile"" social media posts, the NSW appeals court has heard. The trial of former Hey Dad! star Robert Hughes was not fair because he was the subject of ""poisonous and vile"" social media posts, the NSW appeals court has heard. Hughes is appealing against his conviction and sentence for sexual and indecent assaults on young girls in the 1980s, arguing his trial was a miscarriage of justice.

NSW District Court Judge Peter Zahra sentenced Hughes to a non-parole period of six years, with a maximum term of 10 years, after a jury found him guilty in April last year.

Hughes' barrister, Phillip Boulten, SC, told the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal on Monday that the trial miscarried in part because of pre-trial publicity and commentary on social media.

""This was a case where there was ... poisonous vilification of [Hughes] not by mainstream media, but by very persuasive social media that involved the most poisonous and vile publicity from which no one could ever recover.

""There was a deliberate attempt made by people on social media to poison the well. A lot of the material that was published [was] deliberately contemptuous.""

Mr Boulten said there were social media posts about Hughes, which received ""millions and millions of views"".

Many of the posts were designed to vilify the actor, and did so, the barrister said.

Justice Margaret Beazley, the president of the NSW Court of Appeal, queried whether the court should consider social media posts and mainstream media coverage separately.

""The mainstream media coverage was comprehensive ... that might be one thing that's not unusual.

""Social media is another thing. I think we need to look at it separately at least in the first instance.

""You're going to have to show how social media impacted on the trial.

""One [form of coverage] was likely to trigger the other. Apart from that, I don't know if there was any connection.""

Mr Boulten also gave a detailed history about one of the complainants in the Hughes trial giving paid media interviews in 2010.

The court heard the woman and another prosecution witness gave interviews to Channel Nine's A Current Affair and to Woman's Day magazine, in a publicity deal organised by agent Steve Moriarty.

""[The woman] signed a one-year publicity agreement with him and she was involved in a number of interviews where she received a payment and he received a commission,"" Mr Boulten said.

Hughes, who is in Goulburn jail, did not appear in court for his appeal, and did not wish to be on audio-visual link.

The appeal continues before Justice Beazley, Justice Monika Schmidt and Justice Richard Button.

8282,"Your 80-year-old aunt is coming to stay for a few days. You’re looking forward to the visit, but realize your home may not be entirely “older-generation” friendly. To help enhance the safety and comfort of your visitor, especially one who may have some of the physical challenges that come with aging, here are a few quick and inexpensive things you can do to make the time less stressful for you and more comfortable for your guest:   Check out trendy homes at East Haven by Warmington Residential   Consider pathways in the house. Clear obstacles, and maybe even move furniture that a person usually has to maneuver around. Move any electrical cords that are where a person might walk – perhaps taping them to a wall or using a hook. Clear stairs of any objects—shoes, books, and other personal items that tend to collect on the lower treads. Also check that railings on stairs inside and out are secure, and make repairs where needed. Lighting is crucial. Put night lights in bathrooms, the guest bedroom, any hallways near the guest bedroom, and perhaps in the kitchen. Make sure there is a lamp or light switch within easy reach of the guest bed so that your visitor can keep a light on until safely tucked in. Well-lit outdoor walkways and entrances are also key for coming or going when it is dark. Be sure the shower your guest will use has a non-slip floor. To enhance the traction, apply non-slip strips or a suction-attached non-slip mat, both readily available at home improvement stores. Secure or, preferably, remove any throw rugs, including bathroom mats. Edges of rugs can be a tripping hazard, and even a slight scoot can affect a person’s balance. If there are rugs you want to secure rather than remove, non-slip pads can help, but safer still would be to apply double-sided carpet tape or even caulk to attach the rug to the floor. If you choose one of these methods, be mindful that you don’t mar the floor underneath. Identify seating in your gathering rooms that is appropriately firm, high in the seat, and preferably that has arms to help a person easily sit down and get up. A chair that is too soft or too low to the ground can strand a person awkwardly. If in doubt about the available seating in the room, bring a dining chair with arms into the room as an alternative. If you are considering other more long-term home modifications for aging in place, be sure to consult a remodeler or contractor who is a Certified Aging-in-Place Specialist.   Source via NAHB.",eb79265f-74d1-4c7d-9add-faea31476510,Blog,2015-09-26T19:00:51Z,TURF,Make Your Home Safe For All Ages,1.0,Blog
4223,"Recently, it seems to me, there are a lot of bloggers that have either suspended their blogs or stopped blogging altogether. It's possible that my impression is due to the selection of blogs that I look in on, which are mostly the blogs of RVers and travelers. But then again… perhaps not.
Blogging went mainstream in the mid 2000s. When I started, in 2006, there were a good number of RV travelers that already had blogs. It was something new, something fresh, and the bubble of people getting into the RVing life in those years were quick to respond. In our first years on the road, (2007 – 2008-ish) the vibe was that every RVer needed a blog. In fact, there were seminars at rallies that expressed that very sentiment. Blogging rapidly became a fad, something expected, something assumed. But, like all fads and meteors, expect it to brighten and fade.
Since many bloggers were/are in it for the social networking aspect, it seems a natural evolution for blogs to migrate to tools designed for this purpose. I'm referring to today's more convenient and less time consuming options for keeping in touch with your “peeps”... Facebook, Twitter, etc., which now seem to be the locus of the “look at what I did today” bunch. It's also possible that I'm looking at a generational phenomenon here. We've all seen a pickup in the number of younger working-age folks who have become RVers and are able to earn a living while they travel. Groups like RVillage and Xscapers are the new generation of travelers with their own methods of keeping in touch, while my circle of reference is a collection of old fuddy-duddy blogs.
In any case, it's not a surprise that the blogs of RVers are fading away. Sure, there will always be a hardcore few, but the bubble will deflate, and the world will continue to turn.",bc315d43-8b28-4bdf-99ca-c801c97c665e,Blog,2015-09-23T17:04:51Z,Thom and Dar's Sabbatical Journal,On Blogging,1.0,News
6466,"Jordan Clarkson, a Filipino-American professional basketball player who currently plays for the Los Angeles Lakers. image: turner.com
There’s been a lot of talk over the summer about second-year guard Jordan Clarkson, a Filipino-American professional basketball player who currently plays for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association for potentially playing for the Philippines' national team. Clarkson has expressed an interest in representing his country, but didn’t want it interfering with his commitment to the Los Angeles Lakers.
According to The Philippine Star, Clarkson will not be playing for the national team at this point in time because of his current commitment:
            ""In an email to US-based Philstar.com contributor Homer Sayson, Mike Clarkson, Jordan’s father, cited timing as a factor in his son’s decision to pass on the  chance to don the           country’s colors, emphasizing Jordan’s  current commitment  with the Lakers in the NBA. Jordan is in town and has  started working out with the nationals.""
Clarkson was initially put on the 24-man preliminary roster for the Filipino squad after being deemed eligible as a natural-born player earlier this month, via Naveen Ganglani of Rappler:
            ""The state of the Philippine national basketball team took an unexpected turn on  Monday, August 24, when it was revealed that Los Angeles Lakers guard Jordan  Clarkson actually       acquired a Philippine passport before turning 16-years-old, making him eligible to suit up for Gilas Pilipinas.""
Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas Director Sonny Barrios told Rappler on Monday in a phone call that reports of Clarkson’s eligibility to play as a “natural born” Filipino player were true.
With Clarkson not playing for the Philippines in international competition this summer, the up-and-comer will get back to focusing on being ready for training camp with the Lakers. The NBA preseason won’t get underway for the Lakers until Oct. 4 against the Utah Jazz in Honolulu, Hawaii. Training camp should get started during the final week of September.
Clarkson will join D’Angelo Russell and Julius Randle as the focal point on a talented young squad with a lot of prove during the upcoming season.

Reid and Pelosi met with Obama to prepare for negotiations. They say they are willing to back a stopgap measure to keep open the government, but insisted it be short term and not include any language about ideological issues, such as funding Planned Parenthood.

Pelosi said the emphasis now is reaching a deal quickly.

“We’re optimistic, we want to be cooperative,” Pelosi said. “We want to negotiate in good faith to see that effectively done in a timely fashion.”

But with only seven working days on the legislative calendar, GOP feuding has prevented any real negotiation on a funding package.

On Thursday, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said congressional Republicans had “shown no interest” in talks with congressional Democrats and accused them of “irresponsible gamesmanship.”

Ahead of the White House meeting, Pelosi told reporters that she and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, had not begun talks: “I spoke with Speaker Boehner about when we would speak about this,” she said.

The lack of communication sets up a replay of the 2013 showdown, which led to a 16-day shutdown.

This year’s shutdown dynamics are driven by an internal GOP feud in the House in which a group of hard-line conservatives are promising mutiny against Boehner if they the perceive any capitulation in his dealing with the Democrats.

On Thursday, Bohner’s top deputy. Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, was forced to address the acrimony inside the GOP caucus. He told reporters that the conservatives who wanted to oust Boehner were distracting and dividing Republicans during negotiations with Democrats.

The danger to Boehner lies in the insistence of some in his party that he not allow any funding package for the federal government if it includes funding for Planned Parenthood, the provider of health services to women recently embroiled in controversy over fetal tissue harvesting.",fba10e8d-ae6e-4082-8c8f-6232b7df78de,News,2015-09-18T00:34:58Z,Journal-Gazette,GOP at odds as shutdown fight looms in House,0.0,Blog

2253,"MANCHESTER, England -- West Ham was the biggest early mover on the final day of trading in Britain's summer transfer window, taking midfielders Alex Song and Victor Moses on loan and buying Croatia striker Nikica Jelavic on Tuesday. Everton signed Argentine defender Ramiro Funes Mori from River Plate for 9.5 million pounds ($14.5 million) on a five-year deal. Plenty more moves are expected on what is usually a frantic day at activity among Premier League clubs. The biggest deal is likely to be Monaco forward Anthony Martial's move to Manchester United in a reported deal worth at least 36 million pounds ($55 million), which would make the 19-year-old Frenchman the most expensive teenager in the history of the game. Premier League clubs have already spent nearly 800 million pounds ($1.2 billion) in this window, which is close to breaking its record of 835 million pounds set last summer, according to football finance expert Deloitte. ''This level of spending continues to be driven in large part by the increases in domestic and overseas broadcast revenue in recent years,'' said Alex Thorpe, senior manager in Deloitte's Sports Business Group. Song will spend a second straight season on loan at West Ham from Barcelona. The Cameroon midfielder's children play in the West Ham academy. Moses will spend a third straight season away from Chelsea, with the Nigeria winger having previously had loan spells at Liverpool and Stoke. And Croatia striker Jelavic left Hull - relegated from the Premier League last season - to join West Ham on a two-year deal. Funes Mori, one of River Plate's best players in the team that won the 2014 Copa Sudamericana and 2015 Copa Libertadores, moved to Everton for 9.5 million pounds ($14.5 million) on a five-year deal to provide competition for Phil Jagielka and John Stones at center back. Funes Mori attended Everton's Premier League match against Manchester City last month, and was pictured wearing a blue-and-white Everton scarf, but had to wait more than a week before sealing his move.",9f762b30-ecfe-41ad-b194-9fe382b4f2a3,News,2015-09-01T13:16:39Z,FOXSports.com,West Ham make triple signing on deadline day,0.0,News
3711,"TIP OF THE WEEK No matter where you turn, pattern inspiration is all around you - from modern architecture and traditional flooring to animal furs, floral arrangements and fashion runways. As homeowners and designers look to personalize spaces and create impactful interiors, patterns are being replicated with paint on walls, floors, furniture and more. “Pattern always catches my eye and is my go-to element for adding something special to a space,” said Grace Bonney, design expert, founder of Design*Sponge and author of the best-selling book “Design*Sponge at Home.” ScotchBlue Brand partnered with Patternbank, experts in modern style and design, to analyze the world of pattern and forecast up-and-coming trends that can help take your home from boring to beautiful by adding depth, color and personality. * Striking Linework: The once simple stripe has found new life with a bold, modern twist. Sharp angles and a fractured, abstract look bring dimension to the standard stripe, and add strong visual impact to even the most awkward spaces around the home. Consider using neutral paint colors for more traditional and elegant looks or brighter colors to infuse energy into the space. * Mod Optic: Bold geometric designs are making their way into home decor with subtle shifts in scale and color. These strong three-dimensional patterns create a clean, modern style that communicates sophistication and audacity. Infuse contrast and depth to create a clean, modern backdrop for existing decor. The pattern allows you to play with a combination of light and dark colors as a way to add different levels of drama based on the space. * Geo Elemental: From north and south to east and west, global influences can be seen in architecture, interior design and on the fashion runways. Merging traditional shapes such as zigzags and diamonds with various color treatments adds a modern feel to deep-rooted tradition, creating a meeting point for contemporary and universal. The lively repetition of eye-catching, sharp lines is ideal for spaces that draw attention in one direction and evoke a strong sense of place. Using earth tones and natural colors add to the global feel of the pattern, while cool neutral colors provide a calming aura.

Maybe a third of the room said so. Whether that number increased by the end of the session, I don’t know, but I would certainly like to think so. One of the attendees was Gregoire Letort, CPO of Electrolux, and someone who ‘gets’ the whole SEI concept. He said that a key driver of SEI at his organisation was competitive pressures from Asia, combined with the fact that his suppliers were spending proportionally more on R&D than Electrolux itself. It would be crazy not to tap into that resource, he said. Without going into detail on how Electrolux does that (you can read about how the company structures SEI and works with open innovation and R&D here) I thought it was worth pulling out just one aspect of the SEI process at Electrolux – how it guarantees a focused approach to idea generation and new business proposals. “It comes from two angles – one is the consumer and marketing one, where we look at megatrends and consumer-useful features,” he told me. “And the other one is the R&D and technology angle, where we are focusing on the roadmap for the technologies we want to work on for the future. The key really is to narrow a little bit which technology you want to focus on.” This focus allows Electrolux to then select a reasonable number of suppliers for input and proposals, and means that its foray into the world of universities, start-ups and even individual inventors is both targeted and efficient. One example of pure SEI that has come through the Electrolux programme is a newly developed “easy lift dish” for its dish washers, which uses a mechanism attached to the lower drawer that brings it to the height of the upper drawer when it is pulled out of the washing machine, for easier loading and unloading. The product will launch early next year, with the solution having already been revealed to the trade. What’s great about this example is that the mechanism didn’t come from a supplier serving the relevant category, but from a different supplier that was only given the opportunity to work on the project because Electrolux’s innovation programme is in place. It’s a clear example of SEI delivering tangible value to an organisation – and for procurement, that is surely where we want to be. Find more blogs on Supplier-Enabled Innovation (SEI) at our Ovation site.

3667,"China may have provided North Korea with 500-thousand tons of crude oil this year, as it has been traditionally doing every year. 
This came on Thursday from Seoul's unification ministry that cited no big difference of vehicle circulation in the North and an increase of taxi companies. 
The ministry made clear though that Beijing did not release any official figures on crude shipments to Pyongyang. 
Some Chinese media have been criticizing Beijing for its generous aid to North Korea, despite continuous nuclear threats.

1315,"( NewsUSA ) - Summer is winding down, and it's time to pack away the flip-flops and the Hawaiian T-shirt and pull out those fancy-toed shoes for an autumn of accomplishments ahead. 
  
But why stop there? Dressing the part is only a starting point. To appear truly sophisticated this season, check out today's tips. 
 
Stay ahead of the game 
 
Whether it's the upcoming weekly meeting at work or a weekend party, sophistication begins with just a little research. Appear ahead of the curve when you plan your day the day before, noting the who, what, when and where for whatever event is up on tomorrow's calendar. Want to really knock the ball out of the park? Go to your appointment five minutes early. 
 
Take a gift 
 
No, it's not required. But nothing says class like someone who arrives on the scene with a bottle of wine, a seasonal candle or even just a plate of homemade cookies. A small, subtle gift for a host can go a long way in establishing that sophisticated image you desire. 
 
Put the pen to work 
 
Pull out that box of thank-you cards you stashed in your bottom desk drawer. Emails are nice, but they're also used every day for everything. A thank-you card has one purpose: to make someone feel appreciated. Take note of the important people in your life that deserve a special shoutout. Add you own scrawling penmanship and a postage stamp, and you're bound to earn at least a few sophistication points for being kind and considerate. 
 
Utilize the Internet 
 
Knowing your facts, whether it's this morning's news or a few details about your favorite 18th century artist, gives you something to talk about in any social circumstance, helping you appear more approachable and knowledgeable. Get in the habit of using the resources around you, such as the Internet, to glean fast facts, fun tidbits and major headlines. 
 
Go FLASR 
 
For smokeless tobacco users, a product that allows you to discreetly do your thing without disturbing the party is essential for becoming a class act. 
 
If sophistication is key, consider FLASR , a portable spittoon that's small and easy to use. Plus, this state-of-the-art accessory has a secure locking mechanism to ensure you avoid embarrassing spills.

Ukraine also will ban Russian planes from using Ukrainian airspace for transit flights if the planes are believed to be carrying military personnel or materiel or dual-use goods. 

Ukraine and NATO accuse Russia of sending troops and weapons to separatist rebels in the east, a charge Russia denies. 

Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said Friday the ban was in accordance with sanctions drawn up by the National Security and Defense Council. A statement from the ministry of infrastructure said it would take effect Oct. 25.

2397,"Many are yet to hit public streets Google is expanding its self-driving car fleet quickly: in the last four months the number of cars it is permitted to drive on California streets has more than tripled.

As of Monday, Google has licenses for 73 self-driving vehicles, up from 23 cars in mid May, according to records from California’s Department of Motor Vehicles. Under state law, companies wishing to test autonomous vehicle technology on public roads need a permit for each vehicle from the DMV.

All of the expansion of Google's fleet is for its latest model, a small, rounded car with a distinctive LIDAR laser imaging sensor on its roof and a top speed of 25 miles per hour.

Google has licenses for 50 of the vehicles although only a handful are currently on public roads. They can be seen driving close to the offices of Google X in Mountain View. 

A Google self-driving navigates streets near the company's headquarters in Mountain View, California, on June 29, 2015.

The remainder of Google's self-driving car fleet consists of previous generation Lexus RX450h SUVs.

These look a good deal more industrial with sensors bolted to the sides and front of the car and a similar laser imaging system on the roof.

A Google self-driving navigates streets near the company's headquarters in Mountain View, California, on June 29, 2015.

Together, the Google driverless cars were averaging about 10,000 miles per week on public roads as of early September, according to the company.

To date, Google has reported a handful of accidents and incidents involving the cars, but none have been attributed to the software. In all reported cases, accidents were either due to other drivers or happened when the car was under manual control, the company says.

With the latest Google fleet expansion, there are now 102 autonomous vehicles licensed to take to the streets in California.

The second biggest fleet after Google is Tesla's, which has 12 licensed cars and has been testing out an autonomous driving mode for use on highways. Tesla is expected to release that to owners . Mercedes Benz has 5 cars and then Volkswagen, Delphi, Bosch, Nissan and Cruise Automation each have 2 cars. BMW and Honda each have one autonomous car licensed in the state, according to the DMV.

The state also requires drivers be issued licenses for autonomous vehicles and in this area too, Google is well ahead of the competition. It has 219 licensed drivers of the 344 in the state.",ddc52996-7230-4f76-94bd-9e3e26549e55,News,2015-09-29T12:23:00Z,Computerworld Australia,Google triples self-driving car fleet in four months,0.0,Blog

4881,"a brief synopsis of this week's major economic reports... 
   
the key report this week was the 3rd estimate of 2nd quarter GDP from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which was released on Friday...other widely watched reports included the August advance report on durable goods from the Census bureau, and the two reports on home sales: the August report on new home sales from the Census bureau and the August report on existing home sales from the National Association of Realtors (NAR)...also released this week was the Chicago Fed National Activity Index (CFNAI) for August , a weighted composite index of 85 different economic metrics, constructed such that a zero value indicates economic growth at the historical trend rate...the CFNAI fell from a revised +0.51 in July to -0.41 in August, which left the 3 month average at +0.01, indicating national economic activity has been very close to the historical trend this summer...the week also saw two more regional Fed manufacturing surveys for September; the Richmond Fed Survey of Manufacturing Activity , covering an area that includes Virginia, Maryland, the Carolinas, the District of Columbia and West Virginia, reported its broadest composite index fell to -5, following last month's reading of 0, indicating the onset of a regional slowdown, as the regional index for September new orders fell from 1 to -12...then the Kansas City Fed manufacturing survey , covering a region that includes western Missouri, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Wyoming and northern New Mexico, reported its broadest composite index was at -8 in September, little changed from -9 in August and -7 in July, indicating a ongoing regional contraction, mostly in the energy industry...thus far, the 4 regional Fed surveys that have reported for September have all been negative... 
 2nd Quarter GDP Revised to Show Growth at a 3.9% Rate  
the Third Estimate of our 2nd Quarter GDP from the Bureau of Economic Analysis indicated that our real output of goods and services increased at a 3.9% annual rate in the quarter, revised from the 3.7% growth rate reported in the second estimate last month , as personal consumption expenditures, nonresidential fixed investment, and residential investment increased more than previously estimated and the increase in private inventory investment was smaller than previously estimated...in current dollars, our second quarter GDP grew at a 6.1% annual rate, increasing from what would work out to be $17,649.3 billion a year in the 1st quarter to $17,913.7 billion annually in the 2nd quarter, with the headline 3.9% annualized rate of increase in real output arrived at after an annualized inflation adjustment of 2.1% was applied to the current dollar change... 
 
while we cover the details below, remember that the press release for GDP reports all quarter over quarter percentage changes at an annual rate, which means that they're expressed as a change a bit over 4 times of that what actually occurred over the 3 month period, and that they only use the prefix ""real"" to indicate that each change has been adjusted for inflation using price changes chained from 2009, and then that all percentage changes in this report are calculated from those 2009 dollar figures, which would be better thought of as a quantity indexes than as any reality based dollar amounts...given the misunderstanding evoked by the oversimplified press release, all the data that we'll use in reporting the changes here will come from the pdf for the 3rd estimate of 2nd quarter GDP , which is linked to on the sidebar of the BEA press release ...specifically, we refer to table 1, which shows the real percentage change in each of the GDP components annually and quarterly since 2012, table 2, which shows the contribution of each of the components to the GDP figures for those months and years, table 3, which shows both the current dollar value and inflation adjusted value of each of the GDP components, table 4, which shows the change in the price indexes for each of the components, and table 5, which shows the quantity indexes for each of the components, which are used to convert current dollar figures into units of output represented by chained dollar amounts...the pdf for the 2nd estimate of the 2nd quarter, which this estimate revises, is here ... 
 
real personal consumption expenditures (PCE), the largest component of GDP, were revised to show real growth at a 3.6% annual rate, rather than the 3.1% growth rate reported last month, as a revised 5.8% increase in the rate of personal spending was deflated with an annualized 2.2% increase in the PCE price index, an inflation adjustment which remained unchanged from the first estimate....real consumption of durable goods rose at a 8.0% annual rate, which was revised from 8.2% in the 2nd estimate, and added 0.57 percentage points to GDP, as real output of automotive products consumed was revised down to show growth at a 9.7% annual rate ...real consumption of nondurable goods by individuals rose at a 4.3% annual rate, revised from the 4.1% increase reported in the 2nd estimate, and added 0.62 percentage points to 1st quarter growth, as only real consumption of fuel decreased by a statistically insignificant amount (rounded to 0.0%)....in addition, real consumption of services rose at a 2.7% annual rate, revised from the 2.0% rate reported last month, and added 1.20 percentage points to the final GDP tally...almost all of the services categories saw increases in the 2nd quarter except for real consumption of housing and utilities, which declined from the higher than the seasonally adjusted norm that we saw in the colder than normal 1st quarter.. 
 
seasonally adjusted real private domestic investment grew at a 5.0% annual rate in the 2nd quarter, revised from the 5.2% growth estimate made last month, mostly due to slower inventory accumulation, as real growth in private fixed investment was revised from 4.1% to 5.2%...investment in non-residential structures was revised up from a 3.1% growth rate to a 6.2% growth rate, investment in equipment grew at a 0.3% rate, not the 0.4% decline previously reported, and the quarter's investment in intellectual property products was revised from growth at a 8.6% rate to growth at a 8.3% rate; in addition, growth in residential investment was revised from 7.8% to 9.3% annually…after those revisions,  investment in non-residential structures added 0.18 percentage points to the 2nd quarter growth rate, investment in equipment added 0.03 percentage points to 2nd quarter growth, investment in intellectual property added 0.33 percentage points, while growth in residential investment added 0.30 percentage points to 2nd quarter GDP... 
 
meanwhile, the change in real private inventories was revised from the previously reported $121.1 billion in real inflation adjusted growth to show inventory growth at an inflation adjusted $113.5 billion rate, which comes after inventories had grown at an inflation adjusted $112.8 billion rate in the 1st quarter....hence the $0.7 billion larger real inventory growth only added 0.02 percentage points to the 2nd quarter's growth rate, in contrast to the 0.22 percentage points addition to GDP from inventory growth reported in the 2nd estimate...however, since lower inventories indicate that fewer of the goods produced goods during the quarter remained 'on the shelf', their increase by just $0.7 billion means real final sales of GDP were only lower by that small amount, and hence real final sales also increased at a 3.9% rate in the 2nd quarter, revised up from the real final sales growth at 3.5% reported last month.... 
 
the 2nd quarter increase in real exports was revised slightly lower while the increase in real imports was revised higher with this release, so our net trade was a smaller positive than previously reported, as exports are added to GDP because they are part of our production that was not consumed or added to investment in our country (and not counted elsewhere), while the increased imports subtract from GDP because they represent either consumption or investment added elsewhere that was not produced here....our real exports grew at a 5.1% rate rather than the 5.2% real export growth reported in the 2nd estimate, and as a result added 0.64 percentage points to 2nd quarter GDP growth, revised from 0.65 percentage points added to the 2nd estimate...meanwhile, the real growth of our imports was revised to 3.0% from the previously reported 2.8% growth and hence imports subtracted 0.46 percentage points from the quarter's growth rate, revised from 0.42...thus, our trade balance added a net 0.18% percentage points to 2nd quarter GDP, still much better than the 1st quarter, when our worsening trade balance had subtracted 1.93 percentage points from first quarter growth... 
 
finally, there were barely any revisions to real government consumption and investment in this 3rd estimate...real federal government consumption and investment was unchanged from the 1st quarter and unchanged from the 2nd estimate, and hence added nothing to 2nd quarter GDP...real federal spending for defense grew at a 0.3% rate, which was unrevised, while all other federal consumption and investment shrunk at a 0.5% rate, which was revised from the 0.4% contraction reported last month....real state and local consumption and investment grew at a 4.3% rate, also unchanged from the 2nd estimate, while they contributed 0.46 percentage points to second quarter growth, fractionally lower than the 0.47 percentage point contribution reported in the 2nd estimate...note that government outlays for social insurance are not included in this GDP component; rather, they are included in personal consumption expenditures only when such funds are spent on goods or services, indicating an increase in the output of goods or services... 
 
our FRED bar graph below , which can also be viewed as an interactive at the FRED site , has been updated with these latest GDP revisions...each color coded bar shows the real inflation adjusted change, expressed in billions of chained 2009 dollars, in one of the major components of GDP over each quarter since the beginning of 2012...in each quarterly grouping of seven bars on this graph, the quarterly changes in real personal consumption expenditures are shown in blue, the changes in real gross private investment, including structures, equipment and intangibles, are shown in red, the quarterly change in real private inventories is in yellow, the real change in imports are shown in green, the real change in exports are shown in purple, while the real change in state and local government spending and  investment is shown in pink, and the real change in Federal government spending and investment is shown in grey...those components of GDP that contracted in a given quarter are shown below the zero line and subtract from GDP, those that are above the line grew during that quarter and added to GDP; the exception to that is imports in green, which subtract from GDP, and which are shown on this chart as a negative, so that when imports shrink, they will appear above the line as an addition to GDP, and when they increase, as they did in the recent quarter, they'll appear below the zero line...it’s fairly clear from this graph that our personal consumption expenditures has underpinned GDP growth over this period, while increasing imports has been the major negative… 
 

 August New Orders for Durable Goods Down 2.0%; Shipments and Inventories Unchanged  
the nominal value of new orders for durable goods fell back in August after June orders were boosted by one time Boeing jet orders and and July orders were boosted by a surge of new car orders... the Advance Report on Durable Goods Manufacturers’ Shipments, Inventories and Orders (pdf) from the Census Bureau reported that the widely watched new orders for manufactured durable goods fell by a seasonally adjusted $4.8 billion or 2.0% to 236.3 billion, following a July increase of 1.9% that was revised from the previously reported 2.0%, and a June increase of 4.1% that was statistically unrevised from last month...year to date new orders remain 4.6% below the orders level of 2014, but some of that decrease is due to falling prices in some durable goods, such as primary metals and fabricated metal products...as is usually the case, the volatile monthly change in new orders for transportation equipment drove the headline change, as those orders fell 5.8% to $83,231 million on a 5.9% decrease to $15,101 million in new orders for commercial aircraft and a reversal of last month's 20% increase in new orders for ships and boats...excluding new orders for transportation equipment, new orders were statistically unchanged, down by just $25 million to $157,568 million, as the important new new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, a proxy for equipment investment, fell 0.2% to $69,795 million, after increasing by 1.5% June and 2.1% in July, both of which have been upwardly revised .. 
 
the seasonally adjusted value of August shipments of durable goods, which will be inputs into 3rd quarter GDP after an inflation adjustment, were virtually unchanged at $243.2 billion in August after they rose by 1.0% in July and 0.9% in June...much of the change was due to shipments of motor vehicles and parts, which fell 1.4% to $52,967 after rising 4.7% in July; excluding the volatile transportation equipment sector, other shipments of durable goods were up by $26 million to $162,417 million, which is again statistically unchanged...meanwhile, the value of seasonally adjusted inventories of durable goods, also a major GDP contributor, rose by $0.1 billion to $401.4 billion, which is considered statistically unchanged, after July's decrease by 0.2%, which was revised from the originally reported unchanged... inventories of transportation equipment were up 0.7% to $132,546 on a 2.9% increase in inventories of military aircraft; without that, inventories would have fallen 0.3% to $268,854 million...since prices for industrial commodities less fuel were down 0.3% in August, real inventories should be closed to unchanged, but following the downward revision of July inventories, 3rd quarter inventories continue to appear to be a negative for next month's 3rd quarter report.. 
 
we consider unfilled orders for manufactured durable goods a better measure of industry conditions than the widely watched but volatile new orders, but they also fell in August, with the order backlog decreasing $2.2 billion or 0.2 percent to $1,195.3 billion, on the heels of a 0.2% increase in July...this left unfilled orders virtually unchanged from the level of both May and June, as the August backlog in orders for transportation equipment fell $2.1 billion or 0.3 percent to $800.3 billion, which you'll note is more than half the total of unfilled orders outstanding....without the transportation equipment sector, August's unfilled orders fell by $137 million to $394,931 million, considered statistically unchanged.. unfilled orders for durable goods are now 1.2% below the year ago level, with orders for computers, primary metals, machinery and defense goods all seeing sizable a year over year decreases in their order backlog... 
 New Home Sales Continue 20% Above Last Year's Pace  
the Census report on New Residential Sales for August (pdf) estimated that new single family homes were selling at a seasonally adjusted rate of 552,000 new homes a year, which was  5.7 percent (±16.2%)* above the revised July rate of 522,000 new single family homes a year and 21.6 percent (±18.7%) above the estimated annual rate that new homes were selling at in August of last year....as you know, the asterisk indicates that based on their small sampling, Census could not be certain whether August new home sales rose or fell from those of July, and the figures in parenthesis represent the 90% confidence range for reported data in this report, which has the largest margin of error and subject to the largest revisions of any census construction series ...sales new single family homes in July were revised from the annual rate of 507,000 reported last month to 522,000 a year with this report, while the annual rate of June sales was revised from 481,000 to 466,000, and the annual rate of May new home sales was revised from 521,000 to 513,000... 
 
the annual rates of sales reported here are extrapolated from the estimates of Census field reps, which showed that approximately 45,000 new homes sold in August, up from 44,000 new homes sold in July, which was revised from the originally reported 43,000....the unadjusted estimate for June home sales was revised from 45,000 to 43,000, while the estimate for May sales, originally reported at 51,000 , was revised from 48,000 to 47,000....the raw numbers from Census field agents further estimated that the median sales price of new houses sold in August was $292,700, up from $291,100 in July, which was originally reported as $285,900, while the average August new home sales price was $353,400, up from $344,800 in July, but down from the average sales price of $356,200 in August a year ago....a seasonally adjusted estimate of 216,000 new houses remained for sale at the end of August , which represents a 4.7 month supply at the August sales rate...for more details and graphics on this report, see Bill McBride's two posts, New Home Sales increased to 552,000 Annual Rate in August and Comments on August New Home Sales .. 
 Existing Home Sales Fell 4.8% in August  
the National Association of Realtors (NAR) reported that seasonally adjusted existing home sales fell by 4.8% in August , projecting that 5.31 million homes would sell over an entire year if August sales were extrapolated over that year, which was still a rate 6.2% higher than the annual rate projected in August of a year ago…the annual rate of July home sales was revised slightly from 5.59 million to 5.58 million....the NAR also says that the median existing-home price for all housing types in August was $228,700, which was 4.7% higher than a year earlier and the 42nd consecutive year over year increase in home prices...the NAR press release, which is titled Existing-Home Sales Stall in August, Prices Moderate , is in easy to read plain English, so you can check that for additional details...as sales of existing properties do not add to our national output, neither these sales nor the prices for which these homes sell are included in GDP, except insofar as real estate, local government and banking services are rendered… 
 
since this report is entirely seasonally adjusted and at a fairly meaningless annual rate, we'll take a quick look at the raw data overview (pdf), which shows that 505,000 homes actually sold in August, down 8.3% from the 551,000 homes that sold in July (which was revised from 552,000) but still up 5.4% from the 479,000 homes that sold in August last year...the decrease in August home sales was seen in all regions of the country, ranging from an decrease of 10.9% to 122,000 home sales in the Midwest to a 6.1% decrease to 107,000 home sales in the West....that same pdf indicates that the median home selling price for all housing types fell from a downwardly revised $231,800 in July to $228,700 in August, while the average home sales price was $271,600, down 1.6% from the $275,900 average sales price in July, but up 3.0% from the $263,800 average home sales price of August a year ago, with the regional averages ranging from a low of $214,600 in the Midwest to a high of $355,400 in the West...for additional coverage with long term graphs on this report, see Existing Home Sales in August: 5.31 million SAAR and A Few Random Comments on August Existing Home Sales , both from Bill McBride at Calculated Risk…

5640,"NEW YORK, Sept. 21, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ALM's Corporate Counsel, the nation's leading publication for general counsel and in-house attorneys, has published its annual survey of outside counsel to the Fortune 500 companies, ""Who Represents America's Biggest Companies,"" online at http://www.corpcounsel.com. To supplement the formal census of law firm and client pairings, Corporate Counsel went behind the scenes to interview participants on the legal department-law firm relationship and what can go wrong with the corresponding billing practices, as well as the factors that are crucial for the process to succeed.

The ALM Legal Intelligence team produces the report by reviewing court papers and regulatory filings for all Fortune 500 companies. The research is conducted throughout the spring and summer, and looks at a calendar year time period (January to December) for the previous calendar year.

""The survey taps into the full analytical horsepower of ALM's Legal Intelligence team – this work requires deep data and analysis skills in addition to a fundamental understanding of the law,"" said Erick Burchfield, managing director of research at ALM. ""The methodological rigor we impose around data collection, cleaning, categorization, and analysis to uncover trends and findings of interest requires that we maximize the use of ALI resources – from data specialists to legal market research analysts.""

""The survey underscores the importance to corporate counsel of brand name law firms with real firepower,"" said Anthony Paonita, editor-in-chief of Corporate Counsel. ""This has been a constant since the survey began,"" he added.

""We also took the opportunity to ask corporate counsel about their main concerns with law firm billing practices, a matter of heightened concern since Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and sparked the economic crisis,"" Paonita added. ""They explained frustrations, but in a new twist since the crisis began, corporate counsel added that they understand the pressures that their private practice counterparts are under.""

2201,"For years, dating to the latter stages of the Bowl Championship Series through the start of the College Football Playoff, teams in the Pac-12 Conference have pointed to a unique argument when plugging the league’s postseason case: Unlike the rest of the Power Five landscape, we play nine conference games and a championship game.The argument remains unique. It simply holds less water after an opening-weekend performance that can only be termed a disaster for a Pac-12 pegged as one of the top two conferences in the Football Bowl Subdivision.Utah and UCLA have beaten non-conference Power Five opponents, Michigan and Virginia, that are trying to resurrect their programs, but their good work was undermined Saturday.The league lost two games against teams from the Mountain West Conference: Washington fell at Boise State, and Colorado did the same at Hawaii. Washington’s in the midst of a rebuilding project, while Boise State stands as the strongest team on the Group of Five level. Colorado’s loss is a poor omen for the Buffaloes’ own quest for respectability.Stanford was barely recognizable against Northwestern, managing just two field goals against a team with just six wins in its last 20 games. Those waiting for the Cardinal’s eventual offensive breakthrough should reconsider their optimism; Stanford clearly took nothing from last season’s late shift toward an up-tempo slant.

8587,"“In God We Trust” continues to create controversy across the land. Will Kentucky taxpayers be forced to foot the bill for new signs? 
 
In the U.S. there is a clear and legal separation between church and state, which makes “In God We Trust” controversial whenever the legend is displayed in government property. Kentucky is the latest state to enter into the discussion that is sweeping several other states. 
 
According to Opposing Views taxpayers in Kentucky could foot the bill for “In God We Trust” signs which have been placed in committee rooms at the state’s legislative building. After the passing of legislation introduced by Republican Albert Robinson, the 13 signs were installed at a cost of $2,811, the Lexington Herald Leader reported. The lawmaker vowed to pay for the signs out of his own pocket. 
 
“In the long run, taxpayers will not get stuck for their cost, even though the state will pay the bill now.” 
 
“That’s exactly what’s going to happen. I intend to raise the money when the next legislative session starts in January or will pay for it myself. I have deep convictions on this.” 
 
The legislation didn’t specify who would pay for the “In God We Trust” signs in Kentucky, but, the motto is now displayed in gold letters on a blue background on the state’s government building. 
 
Displaying the motto has become increasingly controversial in recent months and many groups are protesting its inclusion on government property. As the Inquisitr previously reported, many police departments who display “In God We Trust” on their patrol cars , have come under fire for doing so. 
 
Florida Sheriff Michael Adkinson vowed to keep the “In God We Trust” controversial signs in his patrol cars despite being pressured by the atheist group Freedom From Religious Foundation. 
 
“I will continue to dutifully enforce the law and protect the rights of all parties, regardless of my personal opinions, as I have for my last 23 years in law enforcement.” 
 
“If the Freedom From Religion Foundation wishes us to take them off our vehicles I suggest that they get a judge’s order or a new Sheriff.” 
 
Michael Aldridge of the Kentucky branch of the American Civil Liberties Union is one of those who is opposed to government agencies using the “In God We Trust” suddenly-controversial motto. 
 
“Government should not favor one religion over another but we have seen challenges to similar situations not go far since it is the national motto.”

Fetty Wap spring-boarded into mainstream success before releasing an album with the Top 10 pop hits ""Trap Queen,"" ''679"" and ""My Way."" With that success, most wondered if the 24-year-old rapper-singer could deliver on a full-length musical project. 
 
He certainly steps up to the challenge on his self-titled debut, showing those hits were not a fluke. The production is solid throughout and his vocal delivery is infectious, though his content lacks some depth. 
 
Wap is not much of a lyricist, but he uses the same winning-formula of keeping his sound melodic yet grungy on his 17-track album. It works on ""Couple Bandz"" and ""Again,"" another Top 40 hit, where he attempts to convince a lover that he's about chasing money instead other women. 
 
On ""RGF Island,"" Wap brags about spending excessive money with his crew on an island. He introduces a loyal mate to the street life on ""Jugg,"" featuring Monty, who makes his presence known on multiple songs on ""Fetty Wap.""

6869,"A primeira audição do novo single dos estadunidenses do Tender Age me trouxe a mente o eterno single do Telescopes, Everso, uma das melhores músicas dos 90´s. E Get High é exatamente assim, uma das melhores músicas shoegazer psicodélicas dos últimos tempos. Get High é sublime, envolvente, lisérgica, dançante e vicia desde os primeiros acordes. O lado b, Always é outra viagem desacelerada e hipnótica. Simplesmente até o momento para o TBTCI o melhor single do ano. ***** Interview with Tender Age ***** Q. When did Tender Age start? Tell us about the history...
""Portland-based quintet with a penchant for all things aurally disruptive. Formed in 2012 as a ramshackle group of friends with a love for 90’s sonics, 80’s palates and 60’s strings, they’ve evolved into one of the most promising acts in the Northwest music climate; despite a scene that’s grown decidedly more interested in well-groomed indie-rock and singer/songwriter drudgery. The combo of Tauna Leonardo, Bryan Robertson, Elaina Tardif, Nick Ferrucci and Christopher Klarer has generated a swirling-buzz based on their near-psychedelic sonics, determined live shows and DIY spirit. Coupling the release of a previous 7” single on a local indie-upstart and West Coast jaunts landing them on radio sessions for esteemed tastemaker Michael Stock’s acclaimed Part Time Punks, the band is now poised for a wider breakthrough in the form of their newest double A-side single for SINIS Recordings."" -Mehran Azma (Sinis Recordings)
Q: Who are your influences?
Kim Deal & Kim Gordon. The Breeders, Bleach, Swirlies, Sonic Youth, Galaxie 500, Felt, The Byrds, Throwing Muses, Brian Eno, Big Star, Mazzy Star
Q. Make a list of 5 albums of all time…
Galaxie 500 - ""On Fire"", Big Star - (its a tie between ""Third"" & ""#1""), Stone Roses - ""Stone Roses"", Swirlies - ""Blonder Tounge Audio Tounge"", Jesus & Mary Chain ""Automatic""
Q. How do you feel playing live?
It's a very emotionally disruptive, depleting, rewarding, physical experience that's always changing, evolving, digressing and challenging. We have a crazy collective freak energy reserve that comes out of nowhere every time we play a show. I'm always in a daze after and have no idea what just happened. Q. How do you describe Tender Age sounds?
Regressive Rock, cherry-coloured funk, Sneaky Flute Music. Aurally disruptive...kaleidoscopic whorls of glittering guitar feedback...a three guitar onslaught...atonal coos ...tambourine-filled backbeats. Q: Tell us about the process of recording the songs?
Our current system is to play and develop the songs through practices for shows overtime, then take it into the studio and track everything live except vocals. We overdub vocals and any additional instrumentation later. We've tried to do it this way so we retain as much of the energy from our live shows as possible for better or worse. We've got a good system and routine down though with Revolver Studios in Portland. Q. Which new bands do you recommended
Flesh World, Meringue, William Hart, Nevers, WL, Warm Hands
Q: Which bands would you love to make a cover version of?
the zombies ""time of the season"" friend & lover ""reach out of the darkness""
republica ""ready to go""
our own arrangement of Bob Dylan's ""Dont Think Twice, It's Alright""
we've been doing a cover of Sonic Youth's ""Little trouble Girl"" & Throwing Muses ""Not Too Soon""
Q: What´s the plan for the future....
We've got our new 7"" out this month with SINIS RECORDINGS, doing a US tour to promote that in September & October. When we get back we'll be working on all kinds of goodies we'll be releasing throughout the rest of this year and early next year. Finishing up an album and maybe doing a special tape of rarities and live sessions w/ part time punks. *

Local web-based entertainment blog site HearNebraska.org plans to further its involvement with Omaha’s performing arts with a sponsorship in the Holland Stages concert series this October. 
 
The Holland Stages concert event is scheduled for October 17 and is planned as an engagement for the community as celebration of the 10th anniversary for the Holland  Center in downtown Omaha. Multiple stages will feature a variety of musicians and performers on a total of 5 stages throughout the day. 
 
Aaron Markley, the Hear Nebraska program manager and a UNO alumnus, said that the sponsorship combines his organization’s mission to provide a wider array of talent from the state of Nebraska to a larger scale audience coincides with the concert event. 
 
He said the goal to promote Nebraska’s entertainment, arts and culture through journalistic channels allows the organization to publish and distribute video publication, podcasts, blogs, reviews, and other entertainment-related news articles from their web site, and showcasing artists in live performances. 
 
“We do quite a bit with events around Omaha, Lincoln and recently beyond in greater Nebraska,” Markley said. “We oftentimes partner with organizations to put on indoor and outdoor concerts, and anything from just booking bands to partnering or taking care of anything necessary to put on the event.” 
 
Hear Nebraska’s involvement in these projects naturally gave incentive to the organization to curate, a performance set for the Holland Stages event. Markley said the decision to select artists Simon Joyner and the Ghosts and James Maakestad came from a desire to complement the highlighted artists. They also wanted to consider the volume levels. 
 
“Simon Joyner is quite the prominent figure in Omaha music, and a fantastic musician and songwriter. We felt that James was a good complement, he has a lot of the same sort of attributes and songwriting skills. Logistically, as far as the festival goes, I think because the stages aren’t going to be isolated, we didn’t want to book a really loud rock band,” Markley said. “we didn’t want to blow away or drown out any of the other stages.” 
 
Hear Nebraska was started in 2010 as a project by UNL graduate Andrew Norman while working on his master’s degree at Michigan State University. Norman continued to form the organization with his wife Angie, as a means to bring something back to the state where he was raised. 
 
Hear Nebraska now employs several full-time staff. Markley said the toughest part of their purpose is not having enough coverage or contributors. He said all too often, many journalistic organizations think a music and entertainment division can function with minimal budgets. Hear Nebraska puts more into the costs of covering live music and entertainment, he said, because that’s an important cost. 
 
“We always want to make sure whenever possible the people who work for us are compensated, because what they are doing for us is incredibly important,” he said.

The warm daytime weather New Jerseyans have enjoyed all week is on track to continue through summer's final weekend. 

Friday will resemble the past few days — sunny skies and warm temperatures. Highs are again expected to reach the mid to upper 80s, according to the National Weather Service. 

Meanwhile, an air quality alert is in effect Friday for 12 of the state's 21 counties, meaning those with asthma as well as young children and the elderly should avoid strenuous outdoor activity. Salem, Cumberland, Atlantic, Cape May and the five northeastern counties are not included, according to the state's Department of Environmental Protections. 

One the sun sets, it'll be another clear evening with lows falling to around 60. 

Saturday will be very similar as it will be sunny and in the mid-80s. Some clouds form at night and there's even a slight chance of showers in the northern part of the state. Otherwise conditions will be dry and comfortable — about 60 degrees.

2782,"CANCUN - Like many places in the world, a trip to Cancun and the Riviera Maya is what you make it. Wanna drink your face off and slurp a sweet martini at Cocobongo? Knock yourself out. Prefer exploring Mayan ruins or a spot on the beach to bone up on Margaret Atwood’s latest book? There’s a cabana with your name on it. Rather scuba dive and race personal watercraft over the foaming blue waves? Pry your Visa card out of your wallet and pay up. 
 
Here’s a look at how various types of travellers can enjoy this popular sun destination. 
 
FOR FAMILIES 
 
This is a very family friendly part of Mexico, with a huge variety of child-oriented activities and parks. XCaret is a kind of Mayan theme park near Playa del Carmen with a snorkeling river, cultural shows, a butterfly pavilion, turtle and dolphin pools and more. Wet ‘n Wild is a fun water park at the south end of the hotel zone with slides galore, as well as a dolphin show and a free meal combo with your ticket. I stayed a few years at the Barcelo Maya Beach Resort south of Playa del Carmen. It had more than enough action for my 20-something kids, with scuba diving, snorkeling and swim-up bars, but it wasn’t overly rowdy. They also had lots for smaller children to enjoy, with small water slides and splash pools. The Beach Palace Hotel offers all-inclusive programs with good food and an artsy feel, but they also have music nights and a very nice kids’ program. The town of Puerto Morelos has a small, central square with a playground and tons of restaurants that won’t kill a family budget. 
 
FOR BEACH LOVERS 
 
There’s no shortage of great stretches of sand, so it pretty much depends on what you want. You’ll find a lot of young folks in the party zone of central Cancun. Things become a bit more G-rated near the family resorts. The beach at Tulum is one of the prettiest along the Riviera Maya, with icy blue water and silky sand backed by small cliffs. The beach at Playa Del Carmen attracts a variety of folks and has a nice offshore reef for snorkeling. Nearby Isla Mujeres has quiet beaches (try Playa Norte) and has tours where you can spot whale sharks frolicking in the water. 
 
FOR ANTSY, ACTIVE TYPES 
 
If you’re like me, an hour of reading on the beach needs to be followed up with a long walk or an exploration of some kind. One great activity is a snorkel trip to see the MUSA underwater sculpture “museum,” an oceanic attraction where various works of art, including a guy on a couch eating a hamburger, have been placed on the sea bottom. Scuba gear would be good, but you can see a lot with just a mask and snorkel. Aqua World in Cancun offers guided tours of the museum with snorkel gear. There also are tons of places to rent a jet ski or fast-moving boat, or you can try parasailing in the large lagoon that sits between the Cancun strip and the Mexican mainland. The Mayan ruins also offer opportunities for long walks. You can rent bicycles for just a few bucks and ride around the ruins at Coba. You also can try a snorkel trip to one of the beautiful, freshwater “cenotes” that dot the Riviera Maya’s limestone landscape. They’re like underground grottos, with lush plants and clear, cool water; often with a good variety of aquatic life. El Camaleon , next to the Fairmont Mayakoba resort, is built around lovely waterways and is one of Mexico’s top golf courses. 
 
FOR PhD CANDIDATES 
 
Sure, Cancun is known to attract the odd drink-til-you-drop tourist, but there’s plenty for folks who love both sun and culture. The Riviera Maya is home to several outstanding Mayan ruins. Tulum is small but with a beautiful, ocean-side setting. Coba is wonderful and features one of the few pyramids tourists are allowed to climb (at least for now). The climb is not as hard as it looks, even for scaredy-cats like me, and the views are well worth it. The granddaddy of them all, if you like, is Chichen Itza, about three hours from Cancun; a large complex with stunning architecture. Just south of the main hotel/tourist zone is the Museo Maya, a fine, small museum that explains the local history in excellent style and has ceramic artifacts more than 1,000 years old. There’s also a pretty garden area and a short walk among small ruins. If you’re short of something to read, Alma Libre is a casual store that sells new and used English language books in low-key Puerto Morelos, which feels the way touristy Playa Del Carmen might have felt 30 years ago. 
 
FOR SPA SEEKERS 
 
The Fairmont Mayakoba is part of the Fairmont Willow Stream group, which has some of the world’s best facilities and treatments. The hotel grounds, food and pools are all superb, as well. When I was last here, I took in the Temazcal treatment at the Westin Resort and Hotel at the south end of the hotel zone. It’s an intense, fairly emotional experience with a local shaman where you clamber into a small stone enclosure (think of it as a rocky igloo if you like) and undergo a purifying ceremony and perform ritual chants as locals toss volcanic rocks into a fiery blaze, ratcheting up the temperatures and speeding up the purification process. Participants are encouraged to do so some soul-searching or even reach out to lost relatives. It sounds a bit hokey, but it’s pretty powerful. And quite different from the usual spa with locally-inspired treatments that most properties offer. 
 
FOR FOODIES 
 
I was surprised by the quality of the tacos at Taco Grill, a casual restaurant on the lagoon behind the pretty La Isla Shopping Centre in the hotel zone. La Habichuela Sunset features stunningly presented and intricate menus, with such treats as tender, sweet soft shell crab tacos. It’s also super romantic, with Mayan relics and other historical bits mixed into the décor and a beautiful setting next to a marina. Las Brisas at the Fairmont Mayakoba has smashingly good food and a beautiful setting with views out to the Gulf of Mexico.

2319,"The beverage industry is about giving back to the community. Producers of craft beer and spirits possess an underrated power, humbly changing water into magical elixirs that give us lushes life. But Half Acre Beer Company co-founder Gabriel Magliaro is taking the community service act to another level by giving back to a place that’s partially responsible for his success. Introducing Harshad kolsch, a super-clean beer with an earthy, citrusy nose, brewed specially for the 150th anniversary of his alma mater, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. The beer was released at a private event for SAIC alumni, but the curious can head to the Lincoln Square taproom (4257 N. Lincoln Ave.) for a pint on draft ($5) or a bomber ($7.99 and worth it for the label), while the beer lasts. 

Magliaro, 37, went to SAIC from 2001 to 2003 and worked in advertising for three years after he graduated. Before SAIC, he lived in Colorado, where he got a taste of the culture behind microbreweries, and though he didn’t see himself opening a brewery while in school, it eventually became his dream job. Half Acre got its start in 2006, brewing with Sand Creek Brewing Company in Wisconsin when there wasn’t much going on in Chicago’s craft beer scene. Magliaro teamed up with Matt Gallagher, and the two took off from there. Now, the pair operate two brewing facilities—the original in Lincoln Square with a taproom and a new 60,000-square-foot, 30-barrel brewhouse (2050 W. Balmoral Ave.) in Bowmanville, where flagship beers such as Daisy Cutter are produced and that soon will house a restaurant and biergarten. Magliaro sat down to chat about Harshad and how an art school kid rose to running a successful business.  

Tell me about the name Harshad. What does it mean? 
 
Magliaro: Harshad is a mathematical reference to the number itself, 150, but it’s also a Sanskrit word that means joy seeker. [Half Acre and SAIC] thought that was very appropriate, seeing as the artistic process really centers on that—whether it’s on the creative’s side or on the observer’s side. 

What did you study at SAIC? 

I studied visual communication, photography and writing. The great thing about the school is you can experience a lot of different things while you're there, and it can be as narrow or as broad as you choose. … I got to experience a range of ideas that tie back to Half Acre and being an entrepreneur almost perfectly because doing what we do for a living, just being an entrepreneur and starting a business, you really have to be proficient, if not good, at a lot of different things and be able to tackle different subject matter quickly and effectively. 

Coming from an art school, were you ever fearful about starting your own business and not having a cut-from-the-fabric business background? 

Sure. Still am. I think that’s part of the gig kind of. I think the types of insecurities change. They exist today, but different types of fears. But I did not go to business school. I did not have an MBA. Getting into this, that factual, raw tax-law mindset was not something I possessed, but I think what I did have was some guts and also the ability or confidence to think about things creatively. I could bob and weave in a way that allowed me ... to think creatively about what was happening and how to approach it, and that certainly speaks to my experience at the school. … A lot of things that you might learn in business school are out there right now in books, but at art school and SAIC, that sort of ongoing training in the process of creativity, you can’t really access that in the same way. 
  
You take a very creative approach to your business, and I think some people are really stuck in this idea that business-minded people have to be really clean-cut and uncreative. 
 
But the challenge is to interject your art into whatever you're doing, so you have to really be willing to define or redefine whatever your undertaking is and apply your arts education or the way you think into making your artwork. Here, it was about looking at how we approach making beer when we’re doing it, our labels and how we communicate and interjecting ourselves in a way that best suits our creative self. When I was at school, I saw [Mark Bello] from Right-On Futon speak—he went to the Art Institute—and at the time, he had this corner store at Milwaukee and Division, and he talked about, like, “I sell futons, but every month in my window I have a revolving display,” and they were really good. I can remember going by them all the time. So he took it upon himself to interject that part of him in what he was doing. So you gotta get out there and apply your creativity wherever you land, and there is that outlet 

Any other inspirations? 

Just the Right-On Futon guy. [Laughs.] No, everywhere there were little bits, and I try to be a student of everything. Today we don't pretend to have this mapped out. We’re very much still students of this, and it's an ongoing learning process and we'll try to evolve. We’ll try to be the same type of students from ’06 until whatever it is, we’ll keep going. 

It's interesting that you have such a creative background, but when you started in the craft beer scene, it wasn't necessarily super creative. 

No, it was definitely the opposite at the time. It was really about regurgitating the same sales over and over with the same institution brewers. That was an initial challenge for sure, but we had a part in changing that, and also the world around us was changing. People were thinking differently about consumption in general, whether that was what they were drinking or what they were consuming from a buyer's perspective. Just the makers’ movement as a whole, people were all of a sudden interested in [trying new things], and that's been an essential advantage with us being able to do what we do. 

Money can be an intimidating factor for any business, and it's especially something that hinders artists who get in their heads about not having money. So were you sitting on a gold mine? 

Oh, God no. We started brewing at another brewing company because we couldn't afford to do this, which is not uncommon. We didn't possess a lot of the things to build a brewery at the time … and we started making beer up north and bringing it back to Chicago and begging people to try it. That was pre-’08 market collapse. Matt and I wrote up a business plan and we pitched some banks, and they bit. They loaned us what we thought at the time was a colossal amount of money, and we knew some other brewers in Colorado, they had just built their new brewery, so we offered to buy their entire old brewery. 
  
What’s your advice to students on how they can be better artists? 
 
Really think about the definition of what that is. I would say don't be afraid to completely define it and redefine it and redefine it again. It's really just about taking a creative approach to life and to really get after it. A lot of what allowed us to do this was risk and laying it out there and working a lot of hours. … The success of the early days of Half Acre was on our sweat. It’s really not any more complicated than that. I think we made some good choices, but we did it at the expense of ourselves. ... And hopefully you're doing something you feel really good about. Otherwise, I can't imagine it happening any other way. If I wasn’t pumped about really everything, start to finish—what we were making, who I was working with, the people coming in and connecting with it—if all that didn't feel right to me, we would have definitely bailed or something because it's hard enough if all of those things feel good. Definitely shoot for things that feel good, and don't be afraid to sweat a bunch. 
  
Since Half Acre was one of the early breweries in the Chicago craft scene, you could very easily just keep doing what you're doing and be successful, but do you find that other new breweries popping up challenge you? 

Sure, but I'd say they uplift us too. Just doing [Harshad] is a way for us to invigorate [ourselves] and invigorate the people that are drinking our beer and connect back to the community and serve Chicago and probably will stand as an example for other breweries too. That's something you can do, connect with an educational institution that meant something to your business and highlight your path through what they do. So I’d say we [challenge] other people, and we have others that [challenge] us, and it's a positive thing.

1991,"OTTAWA — That's it, there's no more escaping it —  the holidays are over, the kids are in school, and there's a federal candidate in your riding to settle on before Oct. 19. 
 

                            There might have been a low-key start to this election campaign, triggered by Stephen Harper on the long weekend in August. But Labour Day brings a more official feeling to the campaign — and some harder edges. 
 

                            All three parties will now have their official planes in their air, and the pace of events will pick up. The people who staff the various war rooms, devising communications strategies and monitoring what their opponents say or do, will find themselves working longer hours. 
 

                            More journalists will join the campaigns, with some news media outlets having saved scarce resources for the latter part. 
 

                            And get ready for a tidal wave of campaign ads. The longer campaign has meant that parties get a proportionately larger spending limit, which they can hoard and spend for the moments they want. 
 

                            ""We will see the power of money and I believe it will make a difference in this election campaign; millions will get spent on political advertising,"" said Scott Reid, a former senior aide to Liberal prime minister Paul Martin. 
 

                            ""It's going to be really interesting to see what kind of impact that has, if it feels like there's a slow leak to the Conservatives. Can they halt that general trajectory with the power of millions of dollars in paid media towards the end of September, in October?"" 
 

                            The long weekend might also be a chance for the parties to evaluate the past five weeks, and make tactical adjustments. 
 

                            The Conservatives have been bumped significantly off of their message twice in the first stretch of the campaign. First, the trial of Sen. Mike Duffy forced Harper to answer questions on ethics and honesty over several days. 
 

                            Then last week, the Syrian refugee crisis again put the Conservatives on the back foot, trying to explain the slow pace of accepting applicants fleeing violence. Harper devoted an entire event to addressing the issue, postponing a campaign announcement to fund public transit. 
 

                            Lisa Samson, a Conservative activist and Ottawa consultant, says she doesn't think the party will be retooling their message of good economic stewardship in any significant way. 
 

                            ""August did count in terms of people paying attention. I think people maybe had half an ear towards what was going on in the campaign, but I think impressions are already starting to be made,"" said Samson, managing partner of StrategyCorp. 
 

                            ""Where I see things happening right now, barring any unforeseen circumstances, I think the election is going to turn on questions of the economy. So, who can provide the best economic management for Canada during a time of global uncertainty."" 
 

                            Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau came out of an early August leaders' debate with good marks. Still, he was ridiculed for saying last month that the Liberal plan was to ""grow the economy from the heart outwards,"" a clumsily worded phrase meant to convey a focus on the middle class. 
 

                            His economic plan to build growth by investing in infrastructure, while running deficits for a number of years, was designed to set the party sharply apart from its rivals — but is also a major gamble.   
 

                            For the NDP, the challenge is to continue building momentum. 
 

                            Mulcair hasn't had any major stumbles. His challenges are more deeply imbedded. He still needs to convince the Canadian public that the New Democrats can properly govern the country, and that he is a competent, trustworthy potential PM. 
 

                            Former NDP aide Robin MacLachlan says that Mulcair's campaign to both build the case for change and strengthen the leader's credibility among Canadians began as far back as January. 
 

                            ""The strategy continues, but in this next phase it's about demonstrating the path to victory for the NDP, and in doing so they reinforce the message that the NDP wants to take hold of the voters, that only the NDP can defeat Stephen Harper,"" said MacLachlan, an Ottawa public affairs executive. 
 

                            Still, if there will be any coalescing of anti-Conservative vote behind either Trudeau or Mulcair, it might not happen until the next long weekend — Thanksgiving. 
 

                            Former interim Liberal leader and ex-Ontario premier Bob Rae predicts families will be together then, discussing how they will cast their ballot. 
 

                            ""I mean I look at the numbers and everybody's a contender right now. It would be very unwise to say that the result is determined,"" said Rae. 
 

                            ""For one thing, a lot of people are still undecided … and the other unpredictable thing is events. Things happen."" 
 

                            —With files from Joan Bryden.

5982,"The 2015 U.S. Open men's final has produced the premier matchup in tennis for the sixth time in a championship match this year, as Novak  Djokovic faces Roger Federer for the final major of 2015. 
 
Federer has rummaged through his competition at Flushing Meadows with ease, having not dropped a single set all tournament long and flexing his service muscle. But in order for him to break through for Grand Slam No. 18—and his first since 2012—he'll need to be at his very best against the top-seeded Serbian. 
 
Let's look closer into the matchup and break down how to watch it. 
 
  
  Novak  Djokovic vs. Roger Federer  
Date and Time:  Sunday, Sept. 13 at 4 p.m. ET 
 
TV:  ESPN 
 
Live Stream:  WatchESPN 
 
  
 Preview  

 
Just about any way you slice it, Djokovic vs. Federer has been a push for much of their respective careers. 
 
As expected, the duo are almost neck-and-neck in terms of career wins—Federer has 21, and  Djokovic is right behind him with 20. But it stretches further than that, as Djokovic has a slim 16-14 lead when playing on hard courts. 
 
The two are tied 6-6 in hard-court finals, but Djokovic has had a decisive advantage in best-of-five major contests against Federer over the last several years. From 2010 to the present, Djokovic is 3-0 against Federer in hard-court Grand Slam affairs. 
 
In none of those contests, however, did Federer put together the level of consistency that he's shown over this fortnight in Queens. In not dropping a single set in this tournament, Federer has done something only previously accomplished four times as ESPN Stats & Info noted: 
 

 
But it's no secret that he'll be hard-pressed to keep up his winning ways through Sunday, much less at that straight-set pace that he's been working on. The 28-year-old Djokovic is in his absolute prime, playing incredibly and looking rather unbeatable in a best-of-five setting. 
 

 
While he's got dozens of experiences with Djokovic to scout from, feelings from Federer's camp are that he's simply playing well enough to get there as co-coach Stefan Edberg told  New York Times ' Christopher Clarey : 
 
“I mean, obviously, things change when you get older, but he has the tools that are necessary to take you all the way,"" Edberg said. ""Hopefully, he can keep it going here. He’s playing well enough to have a shot.” 
 
At 34, Federer undoubtedly isn't the player that he was four or five years ago, when he was around Djokovic 's age and level of play. But he's revitalized his style and play to stay ahead of the curve, and despite an emergence of many other players, Federer has remained Djokovic 's chief rival. 
 
With 21 previous instances of defeat to look back on and a chance to become a three-time major champion in a single season, don't expect that to slip Djokovic 's mind as he prepares for Sunday's duel.

3713,"Susanna Reid was left fanning herself after quizzing David Beckham about his leap into acting and his daughter's desire to become a footballer. 
 
		 
Grinning throughout the interview for Good Morning Britain, Reid sat back in her seat and joked that it was ""hot"" under the lights, prompting the star to compliment her dress. 
  Good Morning Britain presenter Susanna Reid interviewing David Beckham. (Picture: ITV)   
Giggling after the segment, she told co-presenter Kate Garraway she now considers the father of four a ""friend"". 

			 
The footballer turned model was being interviewed by Reid about his new role in a short film for motorcycle clothing brand Belstaff when she commented on the heat from the studio lights. 



 
""It's blinking hot under these lights, isn't it?"" said Reid as she fanned herself. 

Beckham replied: ""It's very hot. I'm surprised, you've got an amazing dress on and I'm in a t-shirt."" 
  Susanna Reid was interviewing David Beckham on Good Morning Britain   
""I should have worn the t-shirt,"" Reid said back. 

As they returned to the studio, Garraway seemed envious of the exchange. 

			 
""What? The room was hot? You've got an amazing dress? Hang on a minute,"" she said. 

Reid said that she had met Beckham before and ""I consider him a friend now"", before explaining her fashion choice. 

""His wife is obviously doing these amazing dresses all the time, I thought I better wear something befitting the occasion when you're interviewing a fashion icon,"" Reid said. 

Garraway incredulously replied: ""You were nothing but professional but I'm weirdly still bitter."" 

			 
During the interview, the world's most famous number seven ruled himself out of being the next 007. 

When Reid mentioned that his name had been floating around as a possibility for the next James Bond, he responded: ""No, I have definitely not been contacted, I am definitely not - obviously - up for doing something like that, but it is nice to be linked, I suppose."" 

Wearing a figure-hugging orange dress, Reid then asked the former England captain if he could do a ""Sean Connery"" voice, to which he replied: ""No."" 

When the footballer then tried to imitate Roger Moore's distinctive eyebrow action, she gushed: ""It is like being in the room with him."" 

Beckham was also asked about wife Victoria, describing daughter Harper's desire to be a footballer as a ""dagger through the heart"", but the doting father said he loved the news. 

			 
He proudly stated: ""It was the best thing I had ever heard."" 

Social media users took to Twitter to express their jealously of Reid's interview. Michelle Loughran posted: ""David Beckham just told Susanna Reid she had a nice dress on.... One hell of a perk to the daybreak job!"" 

But one user accused her of flirting with the former footballer. ""You're a terrible flirt #itshotinhere #Ishouldhavewornatshirt,"" he tweeted.

3160,"New York (AFP) - Third seed and 2012 champion Andy Murray came back from two sets down to defeat tiring Frenchman Adrian Mannarino and make the US Open third round on Thursday. 

Murray triumphed 5-7, 4-6, 6-1, 6-3, 6-1 after his world number 35 opponent had threatened to condemn him to his earliest loss in New York since also making the second round on debut in 2005. 

But left-hander Mannarino wilted in the 30-degree heat and humidity in Arthur Ashe Stadium as Murray's greater freshness and physical condition proved crucial. 

Murray goes on to face Brazilian 30th seed Thomaz Bellucci for a place in the last 16. 

""It was extremely tough. He hits the ball really flat, has fantastic timing on both sides and it was hard to read the ball in the first two sets,"" said 28-year-old Murray after his eighth career comeback from two sets to love down. 

""I was leaving the ball too short and he made me do a lot of running."" 

Murray, who had needed four sets to beat Nick Kyrgios in the opening round, fired 21 aces -- the last of which was on match point -- while Mannarino was undone by 61 unforced errors. 

It was a familiar tale of woe for the 27-year-old Frenchman, who also had a two sets to love lead over Feliciano Lopez at the Australian Open in January before retiring with heat exhaustion in the fourth set.

6571,"Richard Glossip's execution was stayed Wednesday by Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin. 
  
After the Supreme Court announced it would not stop the execution, Fallin decided to intervene, saying she wanted to examine the state's execution protocol.  
 
""Last minute questions were raised today about Oklahoma's execution protocol and the chemicals used for lethal injection,"" Fallin said in a press release. ""After consulting with the attorney general and the Department of Corrections, I have issued a 37 day stay of execution while the state addresses those questions and ensures it is complying fully with the protocols approved by the United States Supreme Court.""  
 
Glossip, 52, convicted of orchestrating a 1997 Oklahoma City murder, Glossip was set to die at 3 p.m. today. The Oklahoma Department of Corrections announced Fallin's move in a statement at about 4 p.m.  
 
Last month, Fallin  said  she had no plans on halting Glossip's execution and made no effort to issue a 60-day stay under her own authority, saying she believes he's guilty of murder. 
 
The state court of appeals delayed Glossip's execution Sept. 16 when it agreed to review new evidence his attorneys said cast doubt on his guilt. His attorneys cited new witnesses who claimed Glossip had been set up and tied to the 1997 murder.  
 
Following the initial denial of Glossip's appeal on Monday, Glossip attorney Mark Henricksen said he planned to file a petition with the nation's highest court, as reported by news affiliate  KOCO . 
 
In the days since, Glossip's attorney's have filed motions before the United States Supreme Court asking for a stay and urging for further review of the murder case. They also continue to urge the governor for a 60-day pause. 
 
This summer, Glossip’s case drew international attention, most notably when actress Susan Sarandon appeared on the Dr. Phil show to make her case as to why she believes Glossip shouldn’t be executed. 
 
Other high-profile advocates include long-time Oklahoma University football coach Barry Switzer, former United States Sen. Tom Coburn and well known anti-death penalty advocate Sister Helen Prejean who appeared on television alongside Sarandon and met with Glossip prior to his stayed execution on Set. 16. 
 
During his recent six-day visit to the U.S. where he spoke at length on the death penalty, Pope Francis has asked for a reprieve on Glossip's behalf, pleading with Fallin to spare the man's life. According to NBC News , the pope's representative asked Fallin to commute Glossip's death sentence in a Sept. 21 letter, saying that would ""give clearer witness to the value and dignity of every person's life.""  
 
A spokeswoman for Fallin told NBC News the governor does not have the authority to commute the sentence. 
 
In the hours leading up to his execution, area law enforcement officials told the McAlester (Oklahoma) News-Capital that multiple bomb threats were lodged today, some against the Oklahoma State Penitentiary facility. The Oklahoma Department of Corrections declined comment on the threats other than to say the execution was scheduled to move forward as planned.

6257,"Pocahontas is remembered by many ’90s kids as one of the strongest and most independent of the Disney “princess” heroines. 
 
But a Cherokee scholar who runs the website Native Appropriations recently pointed out that Netflix’s summary of the movie didn’t reflect that, the Guardian reports, and rallied Netflix to change it. 
 
The original Netflix summary put Pocahontas’ love life front and center.  
 
Here’s the old summary in a tweet from Adrienne Keene, the writer who pointed it out: 
 
Apparently Pocahontas is on @netflix now. Can we talk about this description? pic.twitter.com/tjaqRY9gs8 
— Dr. Adrienne K. (@NativeApprops) September 1, 2015  
 
As that tweet made its way around Twitter, being retweeted 600+ times, Keene took to her blog to explain exactly what was wrong with the summary. 
 
“The description reads like a porn or a bad romance novel,” Keene  wrote in a blog post . “The use of ‘woman’ and ‘yearns is so… gross. Shudder. The problem? It overly sexualizes the film, and only positions Pocahontas in relation to her romantic options, not as a human being, you know, doing things.” 
 
Keene noted that the movie does partially center around a love triangle, but she also pointed out that Disney movies with male protagnoists aren’t given the same treatment on Netflix. The summaries of “The Hunchback of Notre Dame,” “The Emperor’s New Groove,” “Tarzan,” and “Hercules” all leave romantic subplots out of the picture. 
 
After Keene brought this to the attention of her Twitter followers on Aug. 31, the story started to pick up steam, being covered by MTV , Pacific Standard , and Huffington Post . While Keene received plenty of troll-ish responses  imploring her not to be “offended by everything,” she also received support from people who were equally put off by Netflix’s description. 
 
 @NativeApprops  @netflix YUCK! So disgusted! 
— Des (@DesiMcRae) September 1, 2015  
 
 @NativeApprops  @deray  @netflix everything about that is wrong 
— anonymousaspie (@anonymousaspie) September 1, 2015  
 
 @NativeApprops  @netflix What kind of mess is this? 
— JamaicanBeauty7 (@JBeauty7) September 1, 2015  
 
Then, on September 8, the summary was changed. A “copy manager” from Netflix emailed Keene and thanked her for bringing the issue to their attention, according to Keene’s site .  
 
“We do our best to accurately portray the plot and tone of the content we’re presenting,” he email said, “and in this case you were right to point out that we could do better. The synopsis has been updated to better reflect Pocahontas’ active role and to remove the suggestion that John Smith was her ultimate goal.” 
 
Now, this is what the summary looks like: 
 
“A young American Indian girl tries to follow her heart and protect her tribe when settlers arrive and threaten the land she loves,” it reads. 
 
“Young” is right — as Keene pointed out in another post , in reality, Pocahontas was only about 10 years old when she met the adult John Rolfe (called John Smith in the movie). This is just one of the other aspects of “Pocahontas” with which Keene takes issue. 
 
In her blog post, she seemed satisfied with Netflix’s reaction. 
 
“Not bad, right?? Look at that. From an angry tweet to an actual change in the description,” she wrote . “Sometimes I’m still amazed by the power the internet.”

Comedian Lawrence Mooney could face a tough audience in court next week after he was allegedly clocked driving at speeds of more than 150km/h on a Melbourne freeway.

Mooney, best known as the host of ABC TV's Dirty Laundry Live, was detected driving a Jeep Cherokee at 168km/h on the 100km/h EastLink Freeway at Keysborough just after 10.30pm on Good Friday, police say.

The 50-year-old from Armadale surrendered the 2004 Cherokee to police for impoundment about two weeks after the alleged incident.

Mooney was subsequently charged with driving at a dangerous speed, and exceeding the speed limit.

He is expected to appear at the Moorabbin Magistrates Court next Friday for a committal mention.

As well as hosting Dirty Laundry Live, Mooney also starred in ABC TV's Agony series and It's a Date, in which he co-wrote episodes.

He won best show at the this year's Sydney Comedy Festival and was also nominated for a Melbourne International Comedy Festival Barry Award.

6618,", EDT. 
   
NEW YORK, N.Y. - The Toronto Blue Jays acquired some infield depth ahead of their series finale against New York. 

The team announced Sunday that they acquired infielder Darwin Barney from the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for a player to be named later or cash considerations. 

Barney, the 2012 National League Gold Glove Award winner at second base for the Chicago Cubs, is expected to be in New York for Sunday's game against the Yankees. 

The move comes a day after all-star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki suffered a small crack in his shoulder blade when he collided with Kevin Pillar on a catch. 

Barney, 29, appeared in two games for the Dodgers this season and spent the rest of the year with triple-A Oklahoma City, where he hit .277 with 15 doubles, four home runs and 31 runs batted in. The right-handed batter is a career .245 hitter in 566 games.

Infinix Cardiovascular X-ray and Aquilion ONE CT Help Facilitate Successful Angioplasty of Intracranial Stenosis 
 
TUSTIN, Calif., Sept. 23, 2015 – Ronald Cooper of Sydney, Australia, suffered two small strokes and found his basilar artery 90 to 95 percent blocked. His local doctors placed him on medication that offered him little hope for improvement. After his daughter exhaustively searched alternatives, she came across the Gates Vascular Institute (GVI) in Buffalo, New York, and its leadership in conducting successful submaximal angioplasty, a vascular procedure that provides an alternative to stenting and medical therapy. 
 
Mr. Cooper traveled to Buffalo and underwent a successful procedure that saw him return to Australia with his blockage cleared. In the planning and execution of the angioplasty, GVI used Toshiba’s Aquilion TM ONE CT’s perfusion capabilities to confirm a severe narrowing of Mr. Cooper’s intracranial basilar artery. The team then utilized the Infinix™ Elite cardiovascular X-ray system’s superior visualization to carry out the angioplasty to expand the artery and immediately improve blood flow. The decision to use this over the commonly used medical therapy saved his life and prevented a potentially devastating stroke. 
 
“While many physicians don’t consider interventional solutions for this condition, our facility has a strong track record of effectively using submaximal angioplasty to treat intracranial stenosis,” said Adnan Siddiqui, M.D., Ph.D., director of neurosurgical stroke service, Buffalo General Medical Center and Gates Vascular Institute, and professor of neurosurgery and radiology at the University of Buffalo. “The Toshiba systems allowed us to properly assess the situation and effectively use this technique in a manner that allowed the patient to be discharged the next day and be on his way home to Sydney in ten days’ time.” 
 
“The safety and experience of patients treated with our systems is the major influence in our system designs,” said Satrajit Misra, vice president, Marketing, Toshiba. “The use of multiple Toshiba systems across the CT and X-ray/vascular modalities for this procedure highlights that as these therapies evolve, physicians trust our systems to give them the tools they need for success.”

The good news is Chris gets one-year-old Royalty , who is now officially ""Royalty Brown"", 12 days out of the month with no supervised visitation.

On Guzman's end, she managed to get C.B. to pay for Royalty's nannies, schooling, and medical bills. Not to mention Breezy was ordered to pay Nia $2,500 a month in addition to $15,000 of backed child support.

6384,"After Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Preibus raised  anew the prospect of overhauling the presidential primary calendar in future elections, the man who has, for the last four decades, been most responsible for maintaining the early state status quo is dismissing the threat as doomed to fail.  
 
Citing the state law  enacted in 1975 and carried out successfully in every presidential election since then, New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner told The Huffington Post that he will continue to schedule the Granite State’s presidential primary at least seven days prior to any “similar election” held in another state.  
 
“We have a state law,” Gardner said. “With the law, we’re going to have the presidential primary, and it’s going to honor the tradition until the day comes that it’s the will of the people here not to do that.” 
 
Gardner’s comments came after Priebus told  National Journal that the early voting states, including Iowa and New Hampshire, shouldn’t “get too comfortable” with the prospect of maintaining their traditional roles after the 2016 election. 
 
“I don’t think there should ever be any sacred cows as to the primary process or the order,” Preibus said.  
 
Preibus’s comments immediately set off alarm bells in Iowa, whose caucuses have marked the beginning of both major political parties’ nominating contests since 1976, and in New Hampshire -- which has hosted the nation's first presidential primary every four years since 1920. 
 
The privileged roles of South Carolina, which has traditionally held the first presidential primary in the South, and Nevada, which has enjoyed its status as one the so-called “carve-out” states since the 2008 election, were also called into question by Preibus’ surprising remarks, which he offered unprompted to a reporter. 
 
But any concerted effort to upend the early state calendar will be fraught with difficulties, particularly when it comes to New Hampshire.  
 
Since he took office nearly 40 years ago, Gardner has successfully fought back significant challenges to New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation status in every presidential election cycle except for the current one. Gardner enjoys unflinching bipartisan support in the New Hampshire legislature and is a revered figure in the state’s tight-knit political community, which has long bolstered his efforts to keep New Hampshire's primary first.  
 
Though he typically seeks to downplay any budding conflicts with other states and with the major political parties, Gardner frequently turns to history to help make his case that New Hampshire’s special status isn’t going to change any time soon. 
 
In the interview with HuffPost, for instance, Gardner noted that prior to the 1984 election, it was the Democratic National Committee who threatened to take away New Hampshire’s delegates at that year's Democratic National Convention if the state refused to give up its first-in-the-nation status. 
 
Ultimately, the DNC backed down. 
 
“The state has paid for this primary all of these years and never took it from any other state,” Gardner said. “We have a good record of picking who ends up being president."" 
 
Preibus’s comments to National Journal came as the Republican Party is once again facing down the prospect of an extended, debilitating nominating fight that it had sought to avoid after losing its second straight presidential election in 2012.  
 
He raised the prospect of creating a “rotating primary process” that would last about ten weeks and said the issue would be “front and center” when the RNC’s Rules Committee meets at next summer’s Republican National Convention in Cleveland. 
 
Gardner, however, sounded unimpressed by these designs as he gears up for the latest iteration of the New Hampshire primary, which he is likely to set for the second Tuesday in February.  
 
“If the primary is on February 9, it will be the first time in my years that we have had a primary that was not out of compliance with either one or both of the parties,” Gardner said. “Other states have passed laws saying they’re going to do it, too. But it hasn’t worked.”",7c2e4654-e9b6-42fe-a090-9afc0840e57f,News,2015-09-29T16:54:00Z,Huffington Post,New Hampshire Hits Back At RNC On Threat To Upend Primary System,0.0,Blog

  Dr. Eric Vallières, thoracic surgeon, describes the phsycial challenges and risks for patients who undergo a pneumonectomy for lung cancer. Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 3:06 — 21.5MB) Download Transcript How Did You Like This Video?
Please feel free to offer comments and raise questions in our Discussion Forums.   Transcript The pneumonectomy, which I’ve described as when you remove the entire lung, for most patients is, physiologically, a bigger challenge. It is also a more risky operation; in general, patients who undergo a pneumonectomy — their risk of operative death, meaning dying as a result of surgery in the next 30 to 90 days, is three to four times higher than if they had only required a lobectomy. So the more lung you remove, the higher the risk. Now, that’s not true for everyone. If someone comes to us and they already have a tumor that is completely occluding their lung, and they’ve been living like this for months, for us to go in and remove that lung — they’ve already shown everyone, including themselves, that they don’t need that lung, they’re living fine. But for someone who is utilizing that lung, for a significant portion, and when in the operating room you just take it out in one swoop, that is a physiological challenge, and that’s something that we have to evaluate seriously. So the mortality is higher, and the complication rates of a pneumonectomy are also higher — two to three times higher, so it is a bigger challenge to take someone through a pneumonectomy short-term, and long-term. There is evidence now that there are a significant number of patients where they may survive the operation, but two years, three years, five years down the line, the fact that they only have one lung takes a toll on them, and there are some long-term issues for some patients — not all, but for some patients, in having undergone what’s called a pneumonectomy. Interestingly enough, a left pneumonectomy is not as challenging to the patient, nor to the surgeon, as a right pneumonectomy. Our right lung is a bigger lung, and losing your right lung, in general, it’s not universal, is more of a challenge that losing the left lung. There is an alternative for some patients to pneumonectomy, and that’s called a sleeve resection. Now, a sleeve resection is an operation where the tumor that you’re removing is fairly central, and what you do is you cut the airway above the tumor, cut the airway below the tumor, take out the tumor and the lobe — usually the upper lobe on either side, and then you reimplant the bottom part of the lung to where you cut things up. That’s a good alternative, oncologically — so as far as cancer results, it’s as good as a pneumonectomy. But it is physiologically, in the long run, a much better operation for the patients. Some patients who are considered for a pneumonectomy are candidates for these sleeve type of resections, which are done in centers of excellence, but that’s something to be aware of.

4072,"With paired spokes in a 14 front/16 rear configuration, Rolf's Prima Vigor Alpha wheels are highly distinctive. For a better left-right tension balance, a large non-driveside flange on the rear hub is spaced inwards, and for such a low spoke count tensions are high. The merits of this construction are debatable (truing accurately is certainly harder), but our set was well built, and fewer spokes should mean better aerodynamics.Highs: Looks, weightLows: Price, ease of repair
Rolf’s Delta rim profile is almost a standard vee in appearance, and the rim hides internal aluminium nipples. These, along with small cartridge bearings, mean the wheels aren’t well suited to poor weather riding, and our set needed new bearings after a hard winter’s riding.
Our wheelset weighed 668g front and 848g rear, which is reasonably, but not exceptionally light. The rims measured 33mm deep and 22.5mm wide, which pushed our benchmark 25mm Continental GP4000S II tyre up to almost 28mm in width.
On a sunny day, the Rolfs are everything that you would want from a wheel upgrade (apart from being cheap); they’re snappy, light and taut feeling. The rim section isn’t the widest on paper, but it does produce a good tyre profile and isn’t particularly bothered by side winds. You don’t have that harsh riding feel like many old-school straight-sided vee rims either.

8456,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Dallas on Monday. Donald Trump likes that Proverbs verse that might not exist
Jenna Johnson
Nearly three weeks after Donald Trump was first asked to name his favorite Bible verse, he finally has an answer: He likes what the Book of Proverbs says about not bending to envy.
""Proverbs, the chapter 'never bend to envy,'"" Trump said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network's The Brody File on Tuesday evening in California. ""I’ve had that thing all of my life where people are bending to envy."" It was not clear whether Trump appreciated the passage because he had struggled with envy personally, or whether he was referring to envy he had experienced from others.
It also wasn't clear which verse the Republican front-runner was talking about: A search of several of the most-used standard versions of the Bible did not turn up any verse or chapter that urges people not to ""bend to envy.""
In the King James Version of the Bible, there are several mentions of envy in Proverbs: ""Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways,"" reads Proverbs 3:31. Envy is ""rottenness to the bones,"" says Proverbs 14:30. And there's Proverbs 23:17: ""Let not thine heart envy sinners."" But there does not appear to be any verse in that book, or in other parts of the Bible, that urges readers to ""never bend to envy.""
CBN reporter David Brody, who conducted the interview, told The Washington Post that Trump aides said the candidate was referring to Proverbs 24:1-2: ""Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them. For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief.""
This raises the question of whether Trump's reference to the ""people... bending to envy"" he'd experienced in his life was a self-reference, or what other interpretation of the verse there might be.
Hope Hicks, Trump's spokeswoman, did not immediately respond to a request for clarification Wednesday.
[Alongside Trump's campaign, activist clashes are growing uglier]
Trump, who leads the field vying for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, was first asked to name his favorite Bible verse during an interview in late August. He declined to do so, saying the question was too personal and not something he wanted to get into. That prompted a round of criticism from some of his Republican rivals, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who accused Trump of never having read the Bible.
Trump has become unexpectedly popular with evangelical voters even though he has been married three times, does not regularly attend church, once posed on the cover of Playboy and recently described Holy Communion as ""the little cracker."" (The Boston Globe's Matt Viser just wrote about this phenomenon: ""Donald Trump strikes a chord — with evangelicals."") Not having a favorite Bible verse could pose a problem for Trump among evangelicals.
In the CBN interview Tuesday evening, Trump lavished praise on the Bible, calling it ""an incredible book"" filled with ""so many brilliant things"" that provides not only lessons in religion but also in leadership and life. Trump compared the Bible to the Mona Lisa, which becomes more and more beautiful the more you look at it, unlike ""art that is not great""and only has initial appeal.
""The Bible is special,"" Trump said. ""The Bible -- the more you see it, the more you read it, the more incredible it is... I don’t like to use this analogy, but like a great movie, a great, incredible movie.  You’ll see it once, it will be good.  You’ll see it again.  You can see it 20 times and every time you’ll appreciate it more. The Bible is the most special thing.”
[A day before the GOP debate, Donald Trump talks national security on board a battleship]
During the interview, Brody told Trump that ""the word on the evangelical street is there are evangelicals that really are interested in voting for you, but they want you to tone down the insults a little bit."" Brody asked the insult-flinging candidate if that's possible.
""I can understand it a hundred percent,"" Trump responded, ""but, you know, I am a certain type of person.""
Trump said his personality has enabled him to building an ""amazing"" life and business -- and would help him get the United States ""back into shape.""
“I’ve dealt with very tough hombres and very tough people, and I’ve come out on top,"" Trump said. ""And I can understand the evangelicals to a certain extent saying: 'Well, maybe he’s not as nice as we want him to be.' But they also want to see the country be great.”
Brody also asked Trump if he has a weakness. The candidate responded that while he has a ""great temperament,"" maybe he should ""tone it down a bit when pressed.""
""I think maybe I can sometimes tone it down,"" Trump said. ""When somebody hits, you can hit a little bit less hard. At the same time, that may be the kind thing that the country needs because we have to hit back hard. We have to fight hard because we’re not going to have a country.”
Trump continued: “You need a person of tremendous strength -- but I think I could tone it down a little bit, and I’ll try.”",7886dd82-9a93-4f7e-ad4a-9b9a1f99b892,Blog,2015-09-16T18:28:39Z,Pax on both houses,Trump Finally Identifies His Favorite Bible Verse... Which Doesn't Seem To Exist,1.0,Blog

Canberra's Amber Nichols and partner Pete have welcomed a baby girl just weeks after Nichols was eliminated from The Voice . 

The mother-of-two was heavily pregnant during her final weeks on the reality singing contest. 

Her journey on the show was nearly cut short when she lost the battle round while coached by Madden brothers Joel and Benji. She was saved by British pop star Jessie J. 

Nichols then left the show on Sunday 16 August. 

After her elimination, Nichols told Fairfax Media she planned to take a year off after Olive's birth , but would soon be performing again. 

""I've got some plans to do some more writing and releasing some more music and I want to do some shows just to thank everyone that voted for me and thank them for their support,"" Nichols said. 

""I've got a lot of requests - come to Sydney come to Melbourne - so I'm gonna see how I can make that happen.""

1958,"There has been a dramatic drop in Subiaco office rental values — with a massive jump in vacancies — but Colliers International is confident about the area’s mid-term future. 

New research by Colliers International presents a dismal set of statistics for investors in Subiaco office market, with a 15.1 per cent office vacancy and 24,425sqm of empty stock in July. 

Prime office rents ranged from $295sqm to $395sqm, down 17.5 per cent in the past year and by 30 per cent since its peak in 2012. 

If that were not bad enough, Colliers director office leasing Neil Kidd believes vacancy rates will take another hit when the stadium closes, with the closure to undermine the perception of Subiaco as a vibrant hub of activity. 

However, he said investors were voting with their feet, confident that Subiaco’s fortunes would rebound. 

A further 12,525sqm of office space is under construction, due for completion by the end of next year, in developments such as the old Ace Cinema development and an office at 23 Railway St. 

“The new space  ... shows a level of confidence in Subiaco being able to sustain not only more residents and more retail, but increased office and commercial space,” he said. 

Mr Kidd said the quality of the Subiaco stock was better than neighbouring West Perth, with a much lower 11 per cent vacancy rate. 

However he said  better public transport options and better quality stock would soon make Subiaco the more attractive market. 

“There are some critical factors that have to be in place to sell suburban space,” he explained.“It has to be a recognised location. 

“Next is security, including after-hours activation of the area. 

“If you can’t walk out at night after work and feel safe, it is hard for businesses to get employees on board. 

“This is where the retail and restaurant trade makes a difference in Subiaco versus other areas — more so than in West Perth.” 

The latest Metro Office report shows Subiaco has approximately 162,000sqm of commercial space in buildings with more than 1000sqm of office space with two-thirds of this space less than 10 years old.",616d0a5b-7e14-46b7-a911-5df090ef91ff,News,2015-09-15T23:23:00Z,West Australian,Subi office values slide (The West Australian),0.0,News

NEWTOWN TOWNSHIP >> It didn’t take long for the board of supervisors to go on the record with their opposition to fracking, unanimously approving a succinctly-worded resolution asking that two moratoriums banning the practice in Bucks County and the Delaware River Basin be kept in place. 

The resolution, which passed by a 5-0 vote at the Sept. 9 supervisors’ meeting, calls on the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) to make permanent its moratorium on shale gas development, which up until now, does not have a hard-and-fast expiration date. 

In addition, the resolution asks the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to also keep in place its moratorium against issuing permits to drill for oil or natural gas in southeastern Pennsylvania. 

The state’s five-year moratorium on the controversial practice is set to expire on Jan. 1, 2018. 
 
Voting for the resolution were: Chairman Ryan Gallagher and Vice Chairman Mike Gallagher, as well as Supervisors Kyle Davis Phil Calabro and Jennifer Dix. 

Copies of the resolution will be sent to the DRBC, Gov. Tom Wolf and the state legislature asking them to support the moratoriums. 

According to the resolution, Pennsylvanians are entitled to clean air and pure water. It also claims that the state and DRBC have not conducted proper assessments of the long-term effects on hydraulic oil and natural gas drilling on residents' health and the environment. 

The resolution also states: “In the absence of such assessment, it is impossible to determine whether or not shale gas development can proceed safely without creating risks to public health, property values and clean air and water.” 

Fracking opponents who packed the meeting applauded the vote, including Elizabeth Tatham of Holland. 

“I appreciate you following up so quickly,” she told the board. “Thank you for being proactive and this resolution will help Newtown.” Continued... 
  According to the opponents, if fracking is allowed in the area it would create health, safety and environmental problems, with the top worry being groundwater contamination. 
Fracking, which refers to hydraulic fracturing, is when large amounts of water or other chemicals are forced into a drilled shaft at high pressure to loosen oil, natural gas or other resources from thousands of feet underground. 

If, or when, the state and DRBC moratoriums are lifted, drilling companies are expected to seek permission to drill in southeastern Pennsylvania in what is known as the South Newark Basin. 

The basin includes all of Bucks County and parts of Montgomery County. 

However, at this time there are no known deposits in Newtown, Wrightstown and Upper Makefield townships, which make up the Joint Municipal Zoning Ordinance (JMZO), or what is commonly referred to as “the jointure.” 

In order to regulate where that drilling could occur in the jointure, jointure officials have drafted a 17-page ordinance limiting fracking to a zoned area in Wrightstown Township where the quarries currently are located. 

The proposed ordinance was presented to the other two jointure members for consideration. 

Coincidentally, Wrightstown has four-areas specifically zoned for quarries and currently there is very little quarry land now available. 

All three municipalities would have to pass the proposed ordinance for it to take effect. 

Township solicitors have warned that if no specific areas are designated, then drilling companies could challenge municipalities in court, claiming that restrictive zoning prevents them from conducting business. Continued... 
  However, opponents argued that such an ordinance, no matter how well-intended, should not be approved, instead claiming that officials in the jointure should ban the practice outright. 
Marguerite Chandler of the Pennswood Village retirement community in Middletown Township has been fighting fracking for years. 

According to Chandler, properties which have drilling leases on them, especially those with well-water supplies, are finding it harder to get mortgages and homeowners’ insurance. 

She said that neighboring properties to those with leases are also negatively affected. 

In addition, Chandler noted that local governments may also be responsible if a drilling company is underinsured and streams or the Delaware River watershed is contaminated for the millions of people who depend on it for drinking water. 

At a July 8 meeting, anti-fracking activists had implored the Newtown supervisors to formally oppose the practice. 

Vice Chairman Mike Gallagher had told the group that the board supported their efforts to keep fracking out not only Newtown Township, but all of Bucks County. 

“We're with you on this,” he had said. “Our job is being proactive.” 

And Gallagher had explained that the proposal to relegate fracking to the Wrightstown quarries is a legal strategy that the jointure has come up with for when the moratorium is lifted. 

“Let's figure out how we can stop fracking,” Gallagher asserted. “How do we defend against the driller who wants to come in and take our natural resources?” Continued... 
  Fellow supervisors agreed that they don’t want oil and natural gas drilling in the township. 
Many opponents point out that New York State banned fracking after seven years of exhaustive scientific studies, concluding that it would create unsatisfactory health and safety issues. 

Tracy Carluccio, deputy director of the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, a non-profit volunteer group which helps protect the Delaware River watershed, has suggested that the DRBC should make its fracking moratorium permanent. 

“Shallow (fracked) wells are close to aquifers and will contaminate groundwater,” she had stated at the July supervisors’ meeting. “Five percent of all wells drilled leak within five years.” 

Carluccio attended the latest supervisors’ meeting and presented the board with updated materials on fracking’s alleged dangers. 

In other action at the meeting, the board unanimously approved the hiring Gilmore &Associates, Inc. as the township's trail consultant. 

The New Britain-based engineering firm was one of three finalists that the supervisors interviewed for the newly-created position. 

Gilmore & Associates will be tasked to come up with a “Comprehensive Trail Plan” to link and enhance Newtown Township’s numerous trails to make them more attractive to hikers and bikers. 

Fostering economic development and attracting recreational tourism will also key components of that plan, as is protecting the environment. 

Over the years, a number of the existing area trails have been developed by public and private entities, but the paths are now somewhat scattershot around the township. 

In his State of the Township message in January, Supervisor Chairman Ryan Gallagher said that one of his goals for 2015 is creating a comprehensive trail strategy. 

And in a 4-1 vote, with Supervisor Dix dissenting, the board also approved hiring a company to update the township's somewhat antiquated website. 

Five bids were received and the Wrightstown-based AnchorMark Branding Co. was chosen to overhaul the municipal Web page, not only sprucing it up, but also providing residents with more information and linking the site to social media, including Facebook. 

AnchorMark bid $15,000 for the project, money which was allocated in the 2015 township budget for website improvement. 

One of the planned upgrades would help the site integrate better with mobile devices, such as smartphones, which is a problem for the current website. 

In addition, township forms for permits would still be available online, but there would also be a way to pay fees on the website. 

Videos of supervisors’ meetings now posted online would also be improved. 

The planned changes include allowing a person who is watching the supervisors' meeting live on a cable access channel to have the capability to go online and pull up the same Google Docs packet of public information that is on each supervisor's desktop computer. 

When completed the new website is expected to be much easier for administrators to change the information, so it could be updated more regularly.

“I want to let officers know that, while they’re in my neck of the woods, I’ve got their backs. Should they be injured in a fire fight or if someone tries to attack them, they’ve got a safe haven in my home,” Weis told News Center 7’s Lauren Clark on Thursday.

He took to Facebook a week ago, offering to paint the symbol for anyone who expresses an interest in displaying it. The requests, he says, just keep coming.

“I’ve received them from Troy, Tipp City, Vandalia — all the way down to Springboro and Moraine as well,” Weis said. “Of course, I’m really busy here in Huber Heights at the moment but I could see moving this on to other cities and municipalities.

Weis is not asking for money.

But some people, like Ann Dew, are making donations just to keep the project going.

“We’re a house or a family unit that will support our law enforcement — it’s basically just that,” Dew said. “With everything else going on, you know, we just need to start showing our support.”

Leftover donations will be given to the Huber Heights Police Department to use as it wishes.",50bd7519-bcee-4f4b-8bda-062902c8d26c,News,2015-09-25T04:24:19Z,Dayton Daily News,Painted thin blue line show of support for police,0.0,News

1878,"FINDING a way to pair items with the needs of individuals set Australian Local Hero Juliette Wright on the path to establish GIVIT. 

IT all began with a fat baby and a husband’s dirty undies.

This is how founder and chief executive of GIVIT Juliette Wright described the inception of the not-for-profit organisation, which is now a lead partner for the Queensland government during state disasters.

“My baby was so fat that my father-in-law – a dairy farmer – kept dropping hints about what he did with his weaners,” Juliette told a chortling crowd at the QRRRWN gala dinner last Friday night.

The Australia’s Local Hero of 2015 recipient and finalist in Cosmopolitan Woman of the Year Award explained it began when her breastfed baby was too big to fit his designer clothes sent from friends and family overseas.

“I received these clothes that were hardly worn and I was about to put them in a clothes bin in Dayboro, but someone had put a severed pigs head in there and I couldn’t put these beautiful clothes in there.”

So she decided to donate them directly to charity.

“I was so grateful for my life, so I decided to give them away.”

The only problem was, no charity wanted them. Even when she explained they weren’t just ordinary baby clothes – they were designer baby clothes.

“I called up a shelter, and they wouldn’t take them, so I asked them what they wanted. They said new undies,” she said.

Another shelter she called said they needed sanitary pads, and another needed a pair of closed in work boots.

It was an eye-opener. The boots were needed as a family was homeless because the father had lost his job and couldn’t afford a pair of work boots that he needed to get a job on road works.

“We seem to think that what charities need is what we want to donate,"" she said.

“These charities don’t have a big shed at the back to house the fridge and shed waiting for our donation.”

With this epiphany, Juliette was determined to help and skimmed from her grocery money, buying new undies, a new pair of boots and sanitary pads. She delivered these to the shelters.

“I felt so good and really connected to the community.”

It also got her thinking. What if she had a website that matched what charities wanted with what people had ready to donate?

“I spent $500 building a website, and it absolutely failed,” Juliette said.

The website was not able to remove items from the list once they were donated.

“Every single person I know said it would fail.”

And Juliet was filled with rage - she was not going to give up, so she spent another $900, drew up a contract to ensure what was donated fell off the list, and had another website developed.

So began GIVIT.

For the next few weeks, Juliette spent the days glued to her computer, watching for donations that would match charity needs.

Then she would get them together. It eventually came to a head.

“My husband asked me if I would have the time to buy him some undies, and I said I couldn’t because I was waiting for donations.”

When she asked him, why, he pointed to the two-week pile of washing – mainly his – pushed in the corner.

“He said, ‘This website is not automatic’.”

That night, he came home with a bottle of wine and an idea. The virtual warehouse was born.

Now the system works where donations are kept at the donor's place until a person with need selects it. That way, there are no more situations as seen in the Black Friday fires, where 40,000 pallets of donated goods are still in storage.

These pallets take up more than 50,000 square metres and cost $8 million to store, and no one has the time to sort through.

As a result of the virtual system, and the fact needs are matched directly with donations, GIVIT now handles national disasters for the Queensland government.

In 2011, when Queensland was hit by devastating floods, GIVIT had 1.8 million hits resulting in 33,500 goods matched in three weeks.

“Charities can go into the virtual warehouse, and the homeless person sitting with them can choose what they need – and it is like buying it because it’s their choice.”

Because people have a sense of control and ownership, they are more likely to look after what has been donated.

“It’s easy how it works. What is essential for one person is completely different for another, so I need to have no judgement.”

Now GIVIT can handle up to eight disasters at one time.

So far, it has raised over $600,000 for the Ravenshoe disaster, and it is still dealing with the aftermath of Cyclone Marcia, where it has made 7500 donations.

Now, Juliette has just launched GIVIT Kids, a safe online platform for children to give new or pre-loved belongings.

“I am doing a drought campaign for the next GIVIT project,” she told her inspired audience.

2172,"Darrin Spier, of Garland, Tom Porter, of Plano, and Judy McMains, of Whitesboro, were under the assumption that they were at the park to film a Texas Motor Speedway ""Fan Appreciation Day"" segment for ""Big Hoss TV"" that would air during the AAA Texas 500 Chase race on Sunday, Nov. 8. Little did they know the fan appreciation would come from none other than the affable Bowyer. 
Bowyer, wearing a Texas Motor Speedway ball cap and Oakley sunglasses, was disguised as a pestering videographer for the interviewer - the speedway's Total Access Radio Network host Rich Phillips - that was part of the media contingent on hand. He badgered all three throughout their interviews before revealing his identity much to their surprise and delight. 

""I've done a lot of things with fans in the past, but this was the best,"" Bowyer said. ""The folks at Texas always seem to come up with the best ideas. This was like being on Jimmy Fallon. In fact, I got to be Jimmy Fallon for a few minutes here today and that is awesome. All of the people that we surprised had great reactions and it was fun to do a little different skit with each of them."" 

Bowyer relished his role as he bluntly interjected and interrupted the season ticketholders during their interviews. He jumped in to adjust Spier's lapel microphone after ""encountering"" audio issues, chastised Porter for projecting Dale Earnhardt Jr. to fare better than him in the Chase, and stepped out from behind the camera and earned a hug from McMains after she proclaimed Bowyer as her favorite driver. 

""You totally got me,"" said Porter, a season ticket holder for eight years and a Speedway Club member. ""That was awesome. I still can't believe it."" 

McMains, a Texas Motor Speedway season ticketholder for nine years and also a Speedway Club member, jumped with enthusiasm as she realized it was Bowyer, her favorite NASCAR driver, behind the camera. 

""Oh my gosh, I was so excited when I noticed it was Clint,"" McMains. ""I love me some Clint. I have some pictures of him on my phone from the last race at Texas. This is a thrill I will never forget."" 

Bowyer's surprise also included a gift package for each season ticket holder from Texas Motor Speedway Assistant General Manager Kenton Nelson. He presented each with a Charlie 1 Horse cowboy hat - the same ones the Sprint Cup Series winner receives in Victory Lane at Texas - and an oversized AAA Texas 500 ticket bearing Bowyer's likeness with their exact seat location to go along with a bag of speedway merchandise. Bowyer enhanced the cowboy hat and oversized ticket by autographing them for each of the season ticketholders. 

""This was a great opportunity today to promote the Chase and the AAA Texas 500 here on November 8, but it also was an opportune time to show our appreciation for a few of our loyal season ticket holders with the dynamics of this media event,"" Nelson said. ""It's very rewarding to have the chance to connect our fans with a driver like Clint, especially a surprise meeting where their expressions were priceless."" 

Bowyer concluded his visit with a stop at KXAS-NBC 5 in Fort Worth to celebrate NASCAR's new television partnership with parent company NBC that began this season. The AAA Texas 500 - as well as the O'Reilly Auto Parts Challenge on Saturday, Nov. 7 at Texas Motor Speedway - both will be broadcast live on NBC. 

KXAS Sports Director Newy Scruggs conducted a Q&A session with Bowyer for the news staff, the two picked their Chase brackets and the NASCAR star also presented station general manager Tom Ehlmann, Telemundo GM John Trevino and Scruggs with signed cowboy hats. Bowyer's pick to win it all in the bracket was fellow Toyota driver Matt Kenseth of Joe Gibbs Racing. 

Making the Chase for the sixth time in his career did not come without its struggles for Bowyer. He learned last month that this would be his final season with Michael Waltrip Racing as a result of primary investor Rob Kauffman announcing Aug. 22 that the organization would cease operations at the conclusion of the season. 

Without a ride for 2016, Bowyer enters the Chase with little to lose and perhaps an extended audition for potentially interested teams. He remains proud of the No. 15 5-Hour Energy team and its efforts to battle adversity and find its way into the Chase and the chance at what would be a historic Sprint Cup Series championship. 

""This is just a huge relief,"" Bowyer said of making the Chase after his 10th-place finish at Richmond secured his berth in the field. ""It's our last year together, period. As a unit, as MWR exists, this is our last opportunity at bat here to get it all. You just have to have that mentality, and being in the situation you are in enables you to do just that. It's literally anything above and beyond what we've already accomplished at Richmond last weekend is blue sky."" 

A quest for the Sprint Cup championship includes a stop to Texas Motor Speedway for the AAA Texas 500 on Sunday, Nov. 8 - the second of three races in the Eliminator 8 Round of the Chase and eighth event in the 10-race format. 

""I have always liked racing at Texas,"" said Bowyer, a 10-year Sprint Cup veteran still in search of his first Cup win at Texas Motor Speedway. ""The track is wide and fast and it has been a good place for us in the past. I always look forward to racing here and hopefully we are in the Chase when we come back here in November."" 

The Chase for the Sprint Cup - NASCAR's playoffs - is a 10-race culmination to the season that crowns a battle-tested champion. Starting with a 16-driver field, four drivers will be eliminated after every three races, setting up a ""winner-take-all"" championship showdown at Homestead-Miami Speedway on Sunday, Nov. 22 (2 p.m. CT on NBC). The top finisher among the Championship 4 at Homestead-Miami Speedway will win the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championship. The Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup gets underway this weekend at Chicagoland Speedway on Sunday at 2 p.m. CT on NBC Sports Network. 

Fans can select their Chase bracket on www.texasmotorspeedway.com and have a chance to win a free trip to the 2016 Sprint All-Star Race at Charlotte Motor Speedway.

4675,"12.15pm: Mayor flags fines, increased security to prevent repeat of councils shutdown LAST NIGHT: PERISCOPE: Rewatch the live feed from today’s press conference below

Mayor Peter Cox has denied Bendigo City Council cannot continue to get on with its job of governing the city despite the fact that two councillors were not invited to a press conference this morning to condemn the anti-Islamic protest which shut down a council meeting last night.

Cr Cox described the events of last night as unprecedented and that a vocal minority were damaging Bendigo’s reputation as a welcoming community in the press conference at which seven of nine local councillors were present.

“I feel well supported by councillors, by the staff and very proud to be the mayor of Greater Bendigo, particularly in a situation like this because it allows me to express the firm policy that we are a welcoming city and we can grow to greater strengths in situations like this,” the mayor said.

However, Cr Cox confirmed that councillors Elise Chapman and Helen Leach were not invited to the press conference.

Both were given standing ovations by the crowd of protesters who forced a shutdown the council meeting last night. In contrast, the mayor, other councillors and members of the executive, were forced to leave in a police escort for their own safety.

The mayor said that he was not currently aware if council would be looking to press charges against members of the public gallery who physically intimidated councillors and hurled abuse, shouting things such as “Islam wants you dead Cox,” and “there’s worse to come yet”.

However, Cr Cox said the city was currently investigating how it could prevent such an incident from occurring again, such as increasing security at public meetings, issuing fines of up to $350 and his right as chair to name and shame individuals who engaged in disruptive behaviour.

REWATCH THE LIVE PRESS CONFERENCE HERE:

City of Greater Bendigo councillor James Williams has condemned the actions of protesters at Wednesday night's council meeting, describing it as ""over the top"".

""It’s very disappointing and certainly not the way to voice your opinion and not the way democracy works, it’s fine to have a view but it needs to be expressed in a reasonable way and it didn’t happen last night,"" he said.

""In regards to the mosque we ruled on matters of law and they’re trying to make points and issues that aren’t relevant to the decisions made.""

Cr Williams said the council would continue to govern effectively despite the interruption.

""We’ll try to get on with our business as much a possible, this is a distraction and always has been and should be seen as such,"" he said.

""The city’ll just band behind the council.""

Bendigo Sergeant John Dalton has responded to the circumstance at the Bendigo council meeting last night.

“Because of the circumstances and the volatile situation last night they cancelled the meeting and we asked some people to leave, which they did,” he said.

“There were no crimes committed.

“The crowd was boisterous but there was no violence.

“I just dont think its good for the image of the town.

“It doesn’t shed a good light on the town.

“We have got so many good positive things happening for the town.”

Mayor Peter Cox says it would be a shame to have to close public question time but that he will be considering all options after anti-Islamic protesters stormed a council meeting last night.

Cr Cox will be addressing the media at 11am and the Bendigo Advertiser will be streaming the conference via a link on this page.

Speaking to the Bendigo Advertiser shortly the meeting which he was forced to adjourn and from which he had to be escorted by police, along with other members of council and the executive, the mayor said he was a great believer opening up council to the public.

“[But], clearly we had a council meeting, an agenda of about 190 pages of reports to consider tonight which we do in a democratic forum – and that was shut down,” he said last night,” he said.

Cr Cox said he was “shocked” that council would have to consider closing public question time, saying he believed the public should be given an opportunity to hold council accountable over issues of local government. 

“I’ll be inquiring tomorrow what are the process, how we might manage council meetings from now and where we take it from here,” he said.

For more from that interview, see the coverage from last night. 

BENDIGO East MP Jacinta Allan says she was “greatly distressed” after anti-Islamic protesters stormed a council meeting last night and has called on all community leaders to unequivocally condemn their actions. 

“I think anyone who is in a leadership role in the Bendigo community who is passionate about seeing Bendigo progress and seeing Bendigo represented in best way would condemn this behaviour as insult to councillors who were carrying out their duty,” she said. 

“The behavior displayed last was greatly distressing to me and I know with absolute certainty that this is behaviour that does not represent the vast majority of our community and it is behaviour that I’m certain will be condemned by the vast majority of our community.”

The state parliamentarian praised the police for their efforts in maintaining order in a night in which threats were hurled from the public gallery towards elected officials and members of the public physically intimidated the town’s elected representatives. 

“There are two issues here, one is behaviour of people attending council meeting and holding protests and how they conduct themselves in those forums and clearly some of these issues rest with Victoria Police who – whether it was couple weeks ago or last night – are doing an excellent job in supporting our community,” she said.

Ms Allan said the Victorian government also had a role to play in responding to the incident, referring to , which would strengthen councillor conduct standards.

“Then the other set issues is how councillors conduct themselves and how they behave and we will be debating in parliament today a bill which goes to these issues and, if successfully passed, these reforms are about giving council and government a broader range of powers then they have at moment to deal with councillors who breach their code of conduct,” she said. 

Among other disciplinary measures, the Improved Governance Bill would enable conduct panels to suspend councillors for six months in instances of serious misconduct.

Ms Allan said something needed to be done to allow the functioning of council after the protesters – many of whom were wearing signs with Bendigo postcodes to refute claims anti-mosque demonstrators were coming from out of town – prevented elected representatives from doing their jobs. 

“I have no problem with people having different views and expressing those views in different forums but with the right to expression comes responsibility to behave appropriately and to show respectful behaviour and last night that was clearly not on display,” Ms Allan said. 

“Last night it incredibly disappointing, to see a group of people not being way respectful towards elected representatives carrying out their duty as required under our democratic system, with no regard to the role they were playing and no regard for the democratic process.

“These actions shut down the opportunity for other members to participate and other people in the gallery who wanted to have their say from putting forward their views – they were denied that because of disgraceful behavior of these people.”

6649,"The well-known online Slate magazine asks if Walker is Tim Pawlenty 2.0. 

Writer Jamelle Bouie wrote what others have thought. 

""He's not a firebrand and he doesn't alienate ordinary Americans,"" Bouie wrote about Walker. ""Instead, he looks and sounds like a middle manager; an ordinary, almost boring guy who just wants to save you money."" 

The Wisconsin governor should be a winner, Slate reported, since he has done well in a generally Democratic state. The same was written about Minnesota Gov. Pawlenty when he was running for president. 

Politicos have called both dull and uninspiring. In a recent campaign stop in Carroll, Iowa, C-SPAN showed the country - or at least those who watch the channel - that Walker has a ways to go before becoming a charismatic candidate. He sounded much like Pawlenty did in his Iowa campaign, far from a Donald Trump, whose brash talk attracts attention. 

""Right now Walker looks like he's on the wane,"" Slate reports. ""He's not quite Tim Pawlenty - the doomed Minnesota governor who quit the 2012 Republican primary after poor showings in polls and onstage - but he's coming uncomfortably close."" 

Pawlenty dropped out of the race Aug. 13, 2011, a day after he finished third on a straw poll that Iowa Republicans canned this year. That may have been about where Walker would have finished this year. 

One difference is that Pawlenty put all of his eggs in the Iowa basket, expecting his neighboring state's first-in-the-country caucuses to give him a boost into the rest of the campaign. Walker, on the other hand, has spent time in New Hampshire and elsewhere as he apparently is using a broader strategy and has more money. 

It also could be argued that Pawlenty did not have the success in Democratic-leaning Minnesota that Walker has to the east. 

""On paper, Scott Walker is a winner,"" Bouie wrote. ""He doesn't just govern a blue (Democratic) state - a win in its own right - he's transformed it, making Wisconsin a vanguard for conservative causes, from right-to-work laws and public education cuts, to voter ID and strict limits on abortion."" 

But, Bouie continues, Walker has been ""a non-presence. He doesn't flicker, let alone catch fire, and when it comes to issues and answering voters, the Wisconsin governor has been awkward, clumsy and flat-footed. Yes, he has money and yes, he has an organization. But that doesn't make up for skill, or a lack thereof. So far, he just isn't good, and it shows."" 

Still, Slate says, ""none of this means Walker is doomed. If he improves in debates, learns to answer questions, begins to capitalize on missteps from his opponents and otherwise boosts his performance, he could soar. The raw material is still there."" 

Dayton vs. North Dakota 

Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton is not happy with his neighbor to the west. 

When asked during a Minnesota Public Radio State Fair interview, Dayton said Minnesota is on track to meet climate change goals, but not every state can say that. 

""These other states like North Dakota ... just have their heads in the sand and want to profit and then pollute our air accordingly,"" he added. 

At issue, among other things, is a lawsuit North Dakota won overturning a Minnesota law that basically bars the purchase of coal-generated electricity from North Dakota. Dayton said Minnesota will continue the court fight. 

Dayton used the term ""Neanderthal"" in referring to North Dakota climate protection policies. 

Ironically, on the same day Dayton went after North Dakota, officials of the two states held a conference call to see how their differences could be worked out. 

Dayton and North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple are childhood friends, but that has not smoothed out rough edges in relations between the states. 

Klobuchar for president? 

There is plenty of talk that U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., has a higher office in her sights, especially given her new book, and Minnesotans apparently want to know her intentions. 

A reporter following Klobuchar around the Minnesota State Fair for an hour and a half heard some people mentioning the possibility of a presidential run during the quiet morning tour before most people had gone through the turnstiles.

Dayton relaxed 

Gov. Mark Dayton says he is more relaxed at this year's Minnesota State Fair than he has been in a long time. 

For most of his adult life, Dayton either worked for government or was running for office. 

This year, he still will talk to fair visitors, but it will be for information, not campaigning. 

""I like to find out what is on people's minds, and they are not shy about telling me,"" Dayton said on the fair's opening day. ""It is like a rolling focus group."" 

Where are we? 

St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman and Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges joined Gov. Mark Dayton to present proclamations making the opening day of the Minnesota State Fair Ye Old Mill day in the state and their cities. 

Interestingly, however, no one from Falcon Heights appeared in the ceremony, and that is the city where the fair is located. 

After the ceremony, Dayton joined the mayors in a ride in the century-old fair attraction. Dayton's office said it was not planned in advance The mayors sat in the front, mostly hiding the state's governor from cameras when they disembarked at the end of the three-minute ride.

708,"Dear students,
the following posts were chosen best, since they were most interesting to read, demonstrated  pain and effort and... were in accordance with the actual task (unfortunately, some of you somehow got the task wrong and commented on GM food instead - I appreciate your work either way ;-). 1. Do you know what you consist of?
Our genes make us who we are, determine what we look like and even  what our children may look like.
Genes can control behaviour, physical abilities or diseases which reveals the power of such little information in our cells.
So the next time you eat an perfectly shaped red apple you should question where it's perfection comes from. You maybe wonder what food has to do with genes but If I tell you that 90% of groceries in a supermarket are genetically modified then you got the clue!  Cloning animals or foreseeing deseases is only the beginning of an era where changing genetic information becomes a children's game. This leads to the hearing that took place on Friday the 28th of August where a lot of experts of the topic ""genetically modified food"" gathered together in the GBG to discuss advantages and disadvantages of GM Food.  While the representatives of the church tried to make up every negative aspect that could one ever think of, the International Farmer Association brought up convincing arguments regarding to the risk of losing their work and business.  Furthermore the farmes explained the risks of genetically modified food like the ignorance about the aftermaths that this food could bring along since there isn't enough research on it.  On the other side the invited scientists and gen food producers, that among other inventions, invented the fish tomatoe, showed the audience the positive aspects gen food brings along. For instance the easy reproduction or cloning of food by producing seeds which would decrease the number of people starving in third world countries. Other than that gen food helps fighting allergic reactions towards fruits and vegetables.  A mixture of different tastes, fruits or vegetables would also be possible and the variety in supermarkets would increase.  All in all, the hearing was a success and a battle between ethical conventions and modern beliefs which cannot be united all the time but where can be found compromises. by Merve 2. Hey, guys! 
So today's blog post is about a hearing on the relevance of genetically modified food we had with my class on Friday, hope you like it! The idea was to divide our class into different groups and give every student a role they had to take on. So everyone had a role with a special opinion, and no matter what opinion they actually had, they had to support the opinion given with the role they got. I played the role of cardinal Onori - a strict Catholic and member of the Catholic church - obviously against genetic engineering due to moral und religious reasons. Although I am not completely against genetic engineering, as long as it is not damaging to our health, I had to act like I was against it and find reasons for that. Besides my group, there was also a scientists group, a GM Food group and a farmers group.  We also had some journalists who were supposed to ask questions to our groups.  The task was to create convincing posters and issue a statement. After that, we had to answer the questions of the critical journalists. So my group of two - the catholic group - of course stated that genetic engineering is a sin , because only god has the right to change things. To convince the audience about that, we read out an excerpt from the holy bible, in order to show that god did not want us to manipulate his creations. The scientists' group showed us a genetically manipulated tomato, made out of fish, in order to make tomatoes edible for allergy sufferers. Their strongest argument was the fact that tomatoes could grow in several sizes, packed with a lot of nutrients, even more than a natural tomato has. But the main reason was obviously the money they earn out of that.  The GM Food group presented several reasons on why genetically manipulated food is important for our society, and how it could possibly save third world countries. The farmers groups goal was obviously to gain compassion. Their argument was that genetically manipulated food might make them lose their jobs, because GM Food is way cheaper than biologically planted food, so the majority nourishes themselves with GM Food.  The seeds for the plants are way too expensive and there is going to be a time, where they just can not afford them anymore.  The journalists were really critical, they questioned everything we stated and this gave the entire hearing a nice touch and made it even more funny to take on roles. I thought that it was really nice and funny to take on another role, although it is not really my personal opinion, it was a lot of fun to act like I am a strict catholic, praying to god that this has to stop or we are all going to hell haha.  Now to my real opinion, I really do not see a big problem with genetically modified food, as long as everything positive they say about it is real, but the problem is, that we can never be sure if this has damaging causes after years of consuming it. I guess just because I was born eating genetically modified food, I just got so used to it, that I am not really concerned about the causes.  One thing that I just experienced with living in a country full of genetically modified food was that I actually think that tomatoes in Iran, my home country, look and taste different than tomatoes in Germany. They do not modify their tomatoes so I have to admit that I only eat them there because they just taste so good. Tomatoes in Germany just look perfect, but they are not nearly as tasty as the ones in Iran.  All in all, there is only left to say, that the lesson on Friday was really fun and that we should do that more often. We were laughing, but also we were learning about the different aspects and views of this topic. Moreover, I honestly have to admit that I think that GM Food will always have its benefits, but also negative sides, so I could discuss that for hours and never come to a conclusion by Sheyda Delicious genetically modified food So last week we had an interesting hearing in our class and discussed the question: Should we allow GM food in our supermarkets in Germany? Before the discussion, 95% of the class were against it, because it is a health risk and so on.The funny thing is that after the discussion we were not so stable in our opinion anymore, but why did it change? Firstly, everyone of us got a role which we needed to play, so if you had bad luck you got a role with another opinion than yours, for example me. Joking aside I believe that it is better to see things from another point of view and to learn new things. Before the discussion I always connected GM food with something unnecessary, chemical and disgusting, but after I read all the advantages of this GM food, for instance it could help to prevent the hunger in the third world, we could modify tomatoes to grow in a new geographical zone so they can plant them and eat them, it could be a help for our world and society. But on the other hand the people are not always open-minded as to such things especially if they eat modified food and do not know what is in it. It is a little bit scary, like the other groups mentioned (the Church) it is not normal and people should accept the thing we have in our environment. Moreover, we do not have long-time statistics which demonstrate us if GM food is not a health risk in the future and that with GM food no new problems like new illnesses or allergies arise. Another good point being mentioned was that many people will get jobless because GM seeds are cheaper and will grow faster and better, a normal farmer cannot afford such expensive things and will perish under the big companies. After looking at both views it is difficult to have a clear opinion on this topic.  I am undecided since it has many advantages and also many disadvantages, but the feeling that you do not eat real vegetables is a little bit too scary, Maybe in a few years when more statistics and tests are done on GM food I will change my mind, but for now I think it is better to use our normal resources and to find other ways to help the people in the third-world. The health of humans is far more important to me than the money the scientists can make with this idea. by Renata ",68c80656-7a06-4dfc-bcfe-a659bf20c492,Blog,2015-09-01T15:00:45Z,englischphilo,The 3 Winning posts: Last Friday`s Hearing on GM Food,1.0,News
5297,"Environmental problem has become a great issue for modern city and the whole society. With the alarming development of modern urbanization, people’s life in modern city is getting more and more convenient and comfortable day by day. People’s unlimited demands about automation lead to the alarming consumption of carbon and coal which made the environmental condition of modern city more and more terrible. Airwheel electric self-balancing scooter is going to help people solve this problem.

After the triggering of industrial revolution in England in 17th century, people started to move towards modern cities to seek for a better living condition. The development of modern city has been established upon the consumption of carbon and coal. From steaming age to electricity age, carbon and coal has been regarded as the most valuable natural resources for the development of a city or even a country. Nevertheless, the unlimited consumption of carbon and coal has brought people more and more irreversible illness and defects on the environment. In these several decades, people in the west and east are starting to realize the problem and try to make efforts to improve the environmental condition of modern city. In the transportation field, Airwheel electric self-balancing scooter is making efforts to lead an environmental protection tendency in modern city.

Image: 

Airwheel electric self-balancing scooter, with its tiny and simplified structure, is consuming much less electricity compared with conventional transportation tools. Small size and less weight has become a tendency for the whole transportation. Airwheel electric unicycle does well in shrinking the size and reducing the weight of the vehicle. One can even pack an Airwheel electric self-balancing scooter into a bag and take it anywhere he wants. So the designing concept of Airwheel electric self-balancing scooter has given it a great advantage competed with other transportation tools. Image: 

Furthermore, Airwheel electric self-balancing scooter is motivated by pure electricity without any air pollution released during traveling. According to some scientific researches in Europe, Airwheel electric scooter is even more environment protecting than bicycles in the aspect of air pollution. Airwheel electric self-balancing scooter, as high technological product, will help people improve the environmental condition of modern city.

The Economic Times reported that the Apple Watch will enter the Indian market next week. Just a few days ago, Apple had launched its new iPhones and iPads as well as an upgraded WatchOS 2 to the Apple Watch. 
 

 
While the new iPhones are scheduled to come out in mid-October, the Apple Watch will be here before the festive Navratri period which starts in October. The Apple Watch has been introduced in limited countries and the company is also set for the software upgrade. The upgrade will introduce Facebook Messenger and an app called iTranslate. 
 
 
 
Apple has tied up with Hermes for brand new bands. But whether the gold and rose gold bands will make it to India next week is still not known, though Apple CEO, Tim Cook, has stated that the new options will be available in all the 24 markets where the watch is currently sold. 
 
The Apple Watch is expected to be priced somewhere in between Rs 25,000-30,000.

Few details were revealed, including the project's budget or a date when the space will open. 

Made up of studios, the space will be around 2,000 square meters (22,000 square feet). 

YouTube already has such spaces in seven other cities, including Brazil's biggest city, Sao Paulo.

1269,"Last year, a Nokia Lumia 520 and Samsung Galaxy Mega were hailed as lifesavers as the phones displayed bullet-stopping abilities, saving those who carried the devices while being shot. But earlier this week, a student proved that iPhones are just as capable when it comes to taking a bullet. 
 
While walking back to his apartment, a Californian student was shot by a robber, only to have the bullet blocked by an iPhone 5 . 
 
Fresno Police say the man was approached from behind after almost reaching his front door at Campus Edge Apartments. After failing to understand the robber’s demands, the victim was shot at by a black semi-automatic handgun. 
 
While the thief ran off with a silver HP laptop, the bullet was miraculously stopped by an iPhone 5 tucked away in the victim’s pockets. While the student was unscathed in the incident, images published by Fresno Bee show the extent of the damage caused to the phone. 
 

 
The suspect is 5”10, and was wearing a dark ski mask, a black sweatshirt and dark pants. Anyone with information is urged to contact Fresno Police immediately on +1 559-621-7000.

5331,"A Sydney councillor who pulled only one-quarter of the vote in the first round of mayoral elections has nonetheless walked away with the top prize after becoming the city's newest lucky-dip mayor.

Pulling a mayor's name out of a hat is a little-known but not infrequently used means of resolving deadlocked council elections.

By that method Jerome Laxale is Ryde's newest – and youngest-ever – mayor. He joins a rich history of Sydney mayors who owe their position to good luck (the first recorded case is the mildly controversial 1886 election for the Mayor of Camperdown).

But His Worship may be the first-ever mayor to have had his name drawn out twice.

""It's quite ridiculous that it's come to this,"" said Mr Laxale, who has previously backed a reform to council laws to have the mayor popularly elected. ""It's not ideal but I'll have to run with it.""

Mr Laxale, is one of just two ALP members of perhaps Sydney's most scandal-ridden council.

Ryde's meetings are famously acrimonious and have been known to bring some participants to tears.

It was unlikely Mr Laxale – who has made much political hay from Liberal Ivan Petch's appearances before a corruption commission – could ever have hoped to win a vote from the six Liberals who make up half of council.

In the end he didn't have to.

The first round of voting was split mostly along party lines. Liberal candidate Artin Etmekdjian won his colleagues' votes but was one vote shy.

Remaining votes divided evenly between Mr Laxale and independent Terry Perram. By dint of the hat, Mr Laxale was through to the second round.

The Liberal vote didn't shift. But Mr Laxale won support from the independents and claimed six votes for himself.

Another draw (a box stood in for the proverbial hat) had Mr Laxale claiming the right to wear the mayoral wool and gold robes.

The 31-year-old Mr Laxale said he was hoping to ""represent the growing number of Gen Y ratepayers who call Ryde home"" and improve the availability of open space, housing and after-school care.

He now faces an uphill battle to do so with only one other party ally.

But if recent history is any judge, the helm of Ryde council is a job that comes with bigger problems than a lack of numbers.

(The outgoing mayor, Bill Pickering, was recently knocked out cold without warning by a punch thrown by another former mayor at a campaign event. His predecessor, Ivan Petch, will this month answer to charges of blackmail and misconduct in public office).

""I'll try to avoid both scenarios,"" Mayor Laxale said.

His next job will be to respond to another pressing threat: the Baird government's looming plan to merge the city's council.",91e62755-bede-4d79-8f74-b5663c718efd,News,2015-09-09T07:20:08Z,Sydney Morning Herald,Ryde's Jerome Laxale is mayor after name drawn from a hat - twice,0.0,Blog

2186,"Lee Smith celebrates his 90th minute penalty winner 
        
Cinderford Town maintained their impressive start to the season with an entertaining home victory over Marlow. 


Lee Smith's late penalty ensured that John Brough's men stay second in the Southern League Division One South and West table and remain unbeaten at home. 

Marlow took the lead in the 34th minute when Lee Barney capitalised on a short backpass from Sam Hunt and slotted home. 

Josh Nelmes levelled for Cinderford with a close range header and Keiran Thomas put them ahead, with both goals coming in first-half stoppage time. 
  
Nelmes struck again two minutes into the second half, but Marlow pulled one back in the 52nd minute when a corner from Jamal Branker ended up in the net, with Alex Harris failing to keep it out under pressure from Barney. 

Marlow pushed for a leveller and it arrived in the 69th minute when Dan Hicks fired in after efforts from Branker, Barney and Aaron Couch were all blocked. 

Both teams went in search of a winner, with two corners from Marlow deflected onto the post, but Smith held his nerve to convert from the spot in the 90th minute.",2bd2db04-7d61-4ff5-881d-ef1db165fc8d,News,2015-09-06T11:12:44Z,Gloucester Citizen,Lee Smith's late penalty keeps Cinderford Town second in table,0.0,News

3979,"Free El Capitan upgrade is ready to streamline your Mac experience
By Buster Hein • 10:48 am, September 30, 2015
Share on FacebookShare on TwitterNewsTop stories	Photo: Apple
Apple’s latest and greatest operating system for Macs — OS X El Capitan — is now available for free to users around the globe.
OS X El Capitan brings with it a number of new features like Split View and Spotlight search, along with tons of under-the-hood performance improvements that aim to make the Mac more rock-solid than ever. Best of all, it’s absolutely free for all Mac owners.
Apple revealed the operating system this summer at its Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco, showing off the faster and more-repsonsive design to developers. Beta testing has been incredibly postive, according to Apple’s VP of software engineering, Craig Federighi.
“People love using their Macs, and one of the biggest reasons is the power and ease-of-use of OS X,” said Federighi in a statement yesterday. “El Capitan refines the Mac experience and improves performance in a lot of little ways that make a very big difference. Feedback from our OS X beta program has been incredibly positive and we think customers are going to love their Macs even more with El Capitan.”
El Capitan’s new features include an improved Mission Control, better Notes app, Safari tweaks, Maps with public transit directions, natural search for Spotlight, and the addition of Metal for Mac, bringing a big boost in performance for games.
Mac users can pick up the update from the Mac App Store, or via the Software Update section of the Apple menu.

1415,"KANSAS CITY, MO (KCTV) - 

A woman was found shot to death and a man was following a fight at a nearby bar.

The third deadly shooting this Labor Day weekend happened about 2:45 a.m. Monday as customers were leaving Point Bar & Grill located at 917 W 44th St. near the County Club Plaza and Westport entertainment district.

Off-duty deputies, who were working at the bar, found the woman dead across the street in the parking lot of the Country Club Bank, which is where many bar patrons park their vehicles. Authorities have not yet identified the woman killed.

A man in mid-20s showed up a short time later at an area hospital with a gunshot wound with a gunshot to his shoulder. He is expected to survive.

Police said most eyewitnesses fled the area during the shooting. 

""When you get a couple hundred people leaving a bar at one time, especially a small place like this, it is a small area. You know the neighborhood around here is really quiet, so absolutely there were people running everywhere, only so many exits out of this place,"" police spokesman Darin Snapp said.

Officers are encouraging anyone who witnessed the shooting to call the TIPS Hotline at 816-474-TIPS. Investigators also hope surveillance video will give them a suspect description.",14b3b5de-e2cc-4556-b30a-19e9ca751622,News,2015-09-07T14:51:00Z,WSFA,Woman killed in shooting outside Kansas City bar,0.0,News

2660,"46 | Comments    With his contract due to expire next summer Walters had hoped to move elsewhere in the Premier League.   
Jonathan Walters is to remain at Stoke after the transfer window closed without him succeeding in securing his desired move away from the club. 
 
Stoke's summer recruitment of Xherdan Shaqiri and Ibrahim Afellay, and the return to fitness of Bojan, has reduced his importance to manager Mark Hughes in attack. 
 
And, with his contract due to expire next summer, Walters had hoped to move elsewhere in the Premier League. 
 
The forward had even been granted leave from international duty by Ireland manager Martin O'Neill in an attempt to resolve his future, but after reportedly handing in a transfer request amid interest from Norwich he will remain at the Britannia Stadium for the foreseeable future. 
  
Helicopter away for the year ?? sorry LVG it's not happening ?? 
— Jonathan walters (@JonWalters19) September 1, 2015  
Hughes had previously said of Walters' future: ""Jonathan wants a little bit more in terms of the lengths of a new contract, but we are hopeful we can come to an agreement. 
 
""But if we don't, then we will probably keep him and let his contract run down.""",bc8fde71-1ef3-481b-9f76-02825f43ca36,News,2015-09-01T19:46:26Z,RTE Online,Walters remaining at Stoke as window closes,0.0,News
5247,"When our team thinks about the Fashion Forward Man,  various aspects other than personal style sometimes come into play.  Personality, Points of View, and Beliefs are also traits that we want to  learn about, and then reveal to you.  Back in March when we decided to  ask for your submissions to become part of our  Snapped & Caught Series,  we put the ball in our readers court. We were open for almost anything  that came our way, and we welcomed it with open arms. What we didn't  expect was a submission from New York native (and friend to FFM) John Stewart. 
For  those of you that were heavily involved in that downtown, meets lower  east side, meets antique boutique, meets diesel, meets robots, and sugar  babies era of the mid 90's in NYC, chances are you have met John. Once  a heavily pierced face lad, the John Stewart of the past may be gone,  but the underbelly of this intriguing man still lies within.


So how did the coming of ""John"" begin??? Our inductee recalls it all began with his father taking him to The Village. Surrounded by eccentrics, and the carefree, this trip into the city would be one that he would never forget. One can only imagine the feeling of excitement and dare we say a hint of fear the young J.S. was experiencing.   

""The freedom that people displayed was crazy, the unbothered attitude, the fearlessness, struck a cord. I knew I was gonna dress village, work in the village, and BE the village. I never looked back from that mindset"" he shares.

As if his venture into town weren't enough, the final destination would be. His father was taking him to see The Rocky Horror Picture Show at the 8th Street Playhouse. 
 He was celebrating his 13th birthday...
Pivotal points arise in all of our lives,  and in most cases, they happen several times throughout. It can be  visiting a foreign place for the first time, experiencing a breakup, or  receiving a miraculous blessing. How we choose to receive and react to  these moments mold us into the beings that we are today. For John, it  just so happens that one of his life changing moments involving seeing a  man prance on stage in panties and garter belts.  
Though  the famous musical may have effected our latest Snapped and Caught  inductee to an extent, that doesn't mean that he chooses to mimic the  wardrobe choices of the show.  As always, we ask the question, how do  you define your personal style? 
""Hmmmm. Kinda definitely bohemian,urban ,nomadic,future vintage,sporty spice realness, lol. I cant really define it other than to say ""I know what I like,"" he responds. As long as we have known John, his approach to fashion has been rather consistent. That doesn't mean that there hasn't been any mishaps along the way. Stewart shares a story of him being a little boy and wearing bell bottoms. As if to personalize his look, John explains that he would purposely sag the pants to give the illusion they wear drop crotch. But the primary purpose of doing this was to have the widest portion of the pant, completely cover his shoe. (Lets give that a moment...) Yes  John, we agree with you when you say that wasn't one of your better  looks. To pour salt onto the wound, John also shares that he used to  wear bulky sweaters, that he would tuck into his pants with a belt... Welp, we are happy that you left that behind too mister.  

 We know that we are sounding a bit tough on John, but for those of you who doesn't actually know him, we should only be fair and inform you that he would have it no other way. John himself is very witty, humorous,sometimes dark, and most of the time very direct. 
Slightly more evolved and more defined John recognized that he needed to tweak a little of his approaches to his personal style and how he wanted to be seen.  
 ""I completely know my body now. I know how something is gonna fall, sloach, drape, whatever...When I see something, I know immediately if thats my look. I know how something should fit to fit my temperment.... Its a FEELING!!! A bold POW WOW feeling,'' he laughs.

Ferry Pool: There were three Spotted Redshanks, three Green Sandpipers, a Common Sandpiper, a Snipe and 24 Dunlin on the pool at high tide, along with half a dozen Lapwing, c30 Black-tailed Godwits and c80 Lapwing. There were also 25 Shoveler and over 100 Teal present - with the drakes starting to come out of eclipse plumage, plus eight Shelduck and around 400 Black-headed Gulls, with the the whole place looking very busy!

There was not much on view out on the reserve, bar a few Curlew and plenty of Teal, and the two Bar-headed Geese with the Canada Geese early on.

1210,"Northwood House, where Island Roads volunteers have helped uncover a secret tunnel. Picture by Robin Crossley. GROUND penetrating radar is helping to unlock the secrets of historic Northwood House, Cowes, helping rediscover the route of a hidden tunnel that runs from the building to the Nunnery Steps park entrance on Baring Road.

The location, destination and purpose of tunnels have long been the subject of conjecture and now the Northwood House Charitable Trust Company Ltd is being helped by PFI contractor Island Roads to shed light on the suspected subterranean network.

Over the years, it has been suggested the tunnels were used for anything from smuggling to escaping French invaders, or even allowing high profile historic figures including royalty to secretly attend lavish parties at Northwood House.

The charity is hoping the new investigation by Island Roads can separate the myth from reality.

Island Roads utility surveyor, Andrew Tunnicliff, undertook the initial survey of the house and grounds using the ground penetrating radar equipment, traditionally used to locate underground services.

The work was done under Island Roads’ volunteering programme in which staff are given two days paid leave annually in order to lend a helping hand to good causes.

In addition to tracing the route of the 200 metre tunnel, Andrew defined the boundaries of a former Roman Catholic church built in the grounds in the early 1900s for a group of Benedictine Nuns.

Island Roads offered to help with the charity’s research after Andrew read about the building’s secret past in a new history of the house by Tim Wander.

Tim said: ""There has been so much folklore built up around the tunnels, their locations and their uses and we are really grateful to Island Roads for helping to discover some hard facts.

""I look forward to continuing to work with Island Roads on the other side of the house to establish if there are tunnels that might lead to the Ice House, church, air raid shelter or indeed, the recently discovered game larder that was part of the original Bellevue House estate from the 1760s.""

2042,"London’s largest housing associations are set to support the National Housing Federation’s deal on extending the right to buy to housing association tenants but several smaller organisations have rejected the proposal. 
 
But several smaller organisations have already said they will reject the offer , which associations must vote on by Friday. 

The chair of the G15 group of London’s largest associations, David Montague, said the group’s members were signed up to the deal “in principle”. 

The G15 also said it would work with the capital’s local authorities to ensure there is no loss of housing as a result of the deal. 

Mr Montague, who is also chief executive of L&Q Group, said the G15, housing associations and local authorities in London needed to work together to decide how to replace the homes sold. 

When asked whether the homes sold could be replaced with social rented housing, he said:  “What we need to do next is have a conversation with local authorities about what is needed. There is no point building one tenure for the sake of it. We should stand back and ask ourselves what is needed and re-provide on that basis. If social housing is needed, that is what we should prioritise.” 

The G15’s published statement promised the organisation would work with London boroughs to ensure there is no loss of social housing; that each housing association home sold under the right to buy would be replaced and that the G15 would build 93,000 new homes in London and the south east over the next 10 years. 

Asked whether it would be feasible to replace each home sold with another in the same borough, Mr Montague said: “It will be easier in some boroughs than others, which is why we need a London-wide discussion on this. There are very difficult questions that need to be addressed. If we lose homes in Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster and Wandsworth nobody would pretend those homes are easy to replace. We have to ask ourselves whether affordable housing will need to be provided in more affordable places. 

“If there is little or no grant and rents are reducing, we will have to answer  those difficult questions but we can only provide for London’s housing needs if we work together.” 

A number of London boroughs had hit out at the NHF’s Right to Buy deal. Islington, Lambeth and Hackney wrote to local housing associations asking them not to vote for it. 

Matthew Bennett, cabinet member for housing at Lambeth Council, wrote to the NHF’s chief executive David Orr to express his “outrage” at the “backroom deal” which he said would require Lambeth to sell over 120 homes a year to fund the replacement homes and housing association tenants’ discounts. 

In reply, Mr Orr said he was confident that homes sold could be replaced on a one for one basis nationally and at a higher rate in London. He added that the NHF had “never advocated” that the policy be paid for through the sale of local authority property. “How this proposal is paid for is matter for the government,” he wrote.  

The government’s proposal was that councils sell high value properties in order to ensure housing associations were paid the full market value for their properties and to replace properties sold.   

The NHF’s offer document makes little mention of sales of council property apart from saying it expects the government to ensure “the cost of sales does not exceed the value of receipts received from the sale of high value council assets”. It does not suggest any other ways in which the government could fund the Right to Buy extension. 

The offer document also said homes would be replaced on a one for one basis nationally. The replacements do not have to be in the same areas as the homes sold, although the NHF recognised that some organisations would want to replace homes sold locally. It also said the definition of a replacement was broad including starter homes, shared ownership and other part-buy part-rent models. It could include buying homes on the open market or bringing empty homes into use rather than solely building new properties. 

A number of associations have said they will reject the deal including Redkite and Hastoe. 

In a statement, Redkite’s chairman Jennie Ferrigno, said there had been insufficient discussion and transparency around the deal.  She hit out at the way the NHF had handled the deal and said her organisation would be reviewing its membership. She added: “Working with Government should be in the form of a true partnership, yet agreeing to a deal as a result of a threat does not bode well for the future. We have a legislative process where unfair or contentious proposals can be debated and challenged and some sections of our democratic process have expressed the desire to do just this. We must think carefully on these broader issues, or we risk damaging the reputation of our sector.”

9853,"Details on New League of Legends Ultimate Skin LeakedBy Paul Metcalf   /   19 mins ago ShareTweetFollow Us:   Follow @SegmentNext   It looks like details on the next League of Legends ultimate skin may have been revealed. As with all leaks and rumours though this should be taken with a pinch of salt until Riot Games confirm them. If true, here are the details for the skin, Maokai revealed on Reddit by users “WhyMaokaiWhy”: The new skin will be for Maokai and the working title right now is World Walker Maokai. Comes with lore changes to Maokai and slightly expanded lore for Baron Nashor. Will be heavily focused on interacting with Summoners Rift itself. General: New VO/animations/particles/appearance. The difference will be more drastic than Udyr vs SGU. Visual changes to both Dragon and Baron Nashor. Dragon will be very visually different while visual changes for Baron not as drastic. New particles/attack animations/sounds for both. Jungle camps will also have a new appearance Map Interactions: Summoners Rift changes as he walks through the Rift. Flowers and other fauna grow out of the ground, map becomes more naturey/lively in addition to other effects Effects will be small at first, but as he gains passive stacks the effects grow Ally team will always see the effects while enemy team only sees effects if they had direction vision on him in the area he walked through. Changes caused by a trigger: Dragon changes in appearance every time you kill him. Reaches his “final” stage on his fifth respawn If a team kills Baron the entire map becomes much more pristine and Maokai changes in appearance. Overall Maokai has four “stages” of transformation. As already mentioned these details are not confirmed, though people commenting on the original post about the leak do seem impressed by the details. We’ll have to wait and see what news comes about the skin, and if these details are correct. What are your thoughts on the leaked details? Do they seem believable? Let us know below.

5118,"Bryan Cranston found it interesting to get ""in"" Dalton Trumbo's skin.

The American actor portrays the late screenwriter-and-novelist in biopic Trumbo, who was blacklisted due to his political beliefs in the 40s. His fight against the US government and studio bosses over freedom of speech is documented in the movie and Bryan found reliving history an eye-opener.

""Trumbo was a great guy to get involved in. Troubled, confusing, complex... just an interesting guy to get in his skin,"" he told ET Canada.

The film also stars Elle Fanning, Dame Helen Mirren and Diane Lane as Trumbo's wife Cleo, who passed away aged 93 in 2009. It's already garnered Oscar buzz after having its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival recently, apparently receiving a five-minute standing ovation.

Since finding fame on the small screen, Bryan's star has quickly risen, with roles in big flicks such as Drive, Argo and the remake of Godzilla. But for the 59-year-old, playing dad Hal in TV show Malcolm in the Middle will always hold a special place in his heart.

""Right now, I think, I look back on Malcolm in the Middle. It's been ten years since we went off the air, and it'd be fun to pick up that guy's clothes again and be fun and sweet and adorable and hapless and clueless and afraid of everything,"" he smiled.

However, those longing for him to return to the role of chemistry-teacher-turned-meth-cook Walter White in award-winning series Breaking Bad are setting themselves up for disappointment.

2508,"Jesper Koll 
 
When we talk about startup and entrepreneurial activity in East and Southeast Asia, the countries that readily come to mind are Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Despite the fact that Japan is the world’s third-largest economy, the startup ecosystem in the country isn’t on par with its counterparts. 
 
But that may soon change. Jesper Koll, CEO of Wisdom Tree Investments, opined the country is at the “beginning of a new golden age.” Speaking today at Tech in Asia Tokyo 2015 , Jesper said prospects for the next five to 10 years are extremely promising, and Japan is now poised to offer entrepreneurs a significant return for their blood, sweat, and tears. 
 
“Japan is unbelievably rich in intellectual property,” said Jesper. “R&D as a share of national income stands at 3.4 percent of GDP, compared to Germany at 2.5 percent, and China at 1.5 percent.” 
 
Encouragingly, 82 percent of all research activity in Japan is undertaken by the corporate and private sectors. This stands in stark contrast to the US, where the majority of investment in research is done by the government, the results of which are unavailable to entrepreneurs and startups. 
 
The relentless focus on innovation is also starting to pay off in some “weird industries,” claimed Jesper. Japan is on track to recover and become the world’s largest shipbuilder in a few years. This is because corporate Japan never lost focus, continued to invest in research, and is now reaping the rewards for this approach. 
 
The depreciation of the Japanese yen, while not welcomed by all citizens, is nevertheless a positive indicator and one which may well encourage more entrepreneurial activity. Rice, a staple across most of Asia, is cheaper in Japan than in China. This means the agricultural sector is competitive and agricultural engineering is a vertical that offers significant opportunity. 
 
“In general, Japan has priced itself back into the global economy,” said Jesper. 
 
The weak yen also means minimum wage in the country is lower than the US and UK. This helps reduce upward price pressure. 
 

 Stability is key  
Jesper highlighted the fact that in the past 30 years, Japan has only seen two prime ministers that governed the country for a sustained period of time. Political and regime stability is fundamental for investor confidence. Hence, the longevity of current prime minister Shinzo Abe will prove to be beneficial for businesses in the long run. “Whether you like Abe or not […] the government is unequivocally pro-business. They’re trying to reduce corporate taxes, mobilize capital, and they have longevity. There’s no uncertainty of whether rules might change in the near future,” he said. 
 
As for macroeconomic factors, an important point Jesper highlighted was how Japan currently has a savings and labor deficit, unlike previous trends. This deficit is actually positive news for entrepreneurs as it necessitates thinking, strategizing, and foresight. How do you reorganize capital and labor to be more productive? As Japan is a net deficit country, it is more dependent on global capital than ever to maintain existing quality of life. As a result, opportunities for both international and domestic entrepreneurs open up. 
 Ageing demographic an opportunity  
“Look at the ageing population as a potential market,” Jesper told the audience. “Make products and conceptualize solutions, which will be needed by this segment.” 
 
Japan’s young population is shrinking – by 231,000 people every year in the 25 to 35 age bracket. Jesper said this shortage actually creates competition. It’s important to do something sensible and mobilize the population. 
 
In the meantime, the job market in Japan is heating up. The overwhelming majority of fresh college students are finding work several months before they graduate. Moreover, Japanese students are debt-free, meaning they have disposable income. Because of new regulations and cultural shifts, the trend of lifetime employment is also almost over. The salaryman phenomenon is as good as dead, said Jesper. 
 
There’s a huge premium to be an entrepreneur. 
 
Japanese companies less than five years old have created over two million jobs. Those between five to 10 years of age have contributed another 500,000 jobs. And companies 10 years and older have actually destroyed jobs. For the well-being of Japan, Jesper urged entrepreneurs to start a company there.

“Peace is near,” President Juan Manuel Santos said on Twitter, announcing the surprise trip to Havana, where his government has been in peace talks with the FARC for nearly three years.

A FARC source who asked not to be identified said the rebel group’s leader, Timoleon Jimenez, also was going to Havana to meet with Santos, Cuban President Raul Castro and the negotiating teams.

The meeting was set for 5:00 pm local time (2100 GMT), the rebel source said.

Santos said his trip to Havana was “for a key meeting with negotiators with the objective of accelerating the end of the conflict,” which has been running for a half-century.

Both sides have reported progress in resolving one of the most difficult issues of the peace talks — how to bring to justice guerrillas who lay down their arms.

“Justice is at the heart of the peace negotiations and with an agreement on that issue, the dream of building a country in peace begins to become a reality,” the president’s office said in a statement.

The conflict has simmered since the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) took up arms against the government in 1964, unleashing a guerrilla war that has claimed the lives of more than 220,000 people.

When he was hurt last year, fans couldn't wait for him to leave, wishing that he would transfer - hoping it would happen and disappointed when it didn't. That was magnified with the job that JT Barrett did at quarterback and then ultimately with what Cardale Jones was able to accomplish - which nearly put Barrett on the outs. 

Now Braxton Miller is a stud and a hero again - and everyone is so grateful that he stayed and talks about how awesome he is. It makes for a fascinating case study.

124,"Turkey's foreign trade deficit dropped sharply in August, the Turkish Statistical Institute reported on Wednesday. 
In August, the deficit declined  to $4.88 billion, down from $8.11 billion from same month last year, a drop of 39.8 percent. 

Exports were $11.65 billion, a 2.8 percent decrease from August 2014, and imports were $15.95 billion dollars, an 18.2 percent decline year-on-year.   

Turkey’s exports declined by 8.7 percent to $95.67 billion in the first eight months of this year, from $104.8 billion in the same period of last year, while imports tumbled16.9 percent in the same period. 

The devaluation of the lira against major currencies in the past year has made imported goods more expensive for Turkish consumers. 

Overall imports from January to August were down from $54.42 billlion to $45.24 billilon. 

The Turkish Exporters Assembly has attributed the exports slowdown to the weak global economy as well as to the fall of the euro against the dollar -- the decline, however, is in value, while Turkish exports increased in overall volume during the first eight months of this year.",feb4b606-ee60-4483-a6fd-b8f49c2fb9f8,News,2015-09-30T12:09:19Z,Turkish Weekly,Turkey: Foreign trade deficit narrows sharply in August,0.0,News

A boil advisory is in effect for portions of the Buckeye Water District #50 after a leak in a main line on La. Highway 115, according to a release. 

The advisory covers: 

The intersection of La. 115 and Nation Road/La. Highway 1206 (at the caution light), south on La. 115 for about 2.5 miles, to the end of Buckeye Water Sstem's main line (near T. Man Lucas Road), which includes all homes on La. 115 and all side roads — Fred Redwine, Jim Bryant, Kirby Littleton, Woodson Landing, D. Miller, E. Littleton, Camp, Truman Cole, Stubblefield, Brown's Landing, Donald Littleton and William Tyler roads. 

The advisory does not include La. 1206, Nation, Lucas and Beaubouef roads. 

All consumers should disinfect their water before consuming or using it for food preparation. To do so: 
Boil water for five minutes in a clean container. The five minutes starts after the water has been brought to a rolling boil. The flat taste can be eliminated by shaking the water in a bottle or pouring it from one container to another. Mix 30 drops of unscented liquid chlorine laundry bleach with 1 gallon of water. Let stand for at least 30 minutes before drinking or using. 
Water samples are being collected and tested.

1326,"LONDON - Maybe it was sour grapes. Or maybe it was just immense pride.

Mammoth No. 8 Mamuka Gogordze didn't take too kindly to Georgia losing to Japan at Gloucester this month, blowing its last warm-up for the Rugby World Cup in the dying moments.

""It was a good experience against Japan because (our World Cup opener is) against Tonga, and there was a lot of Tongans on the field today.""

Actually, there was only one Tongan-born starter in the Japan side and he was concussed, but that's beside the point. Gogordze wasn't finished.

""I am proud that the Georgian team is full of Georgians,"" he said. ""When I play against Canada, I don't play against Canadians. When I play against Japan, we don't play against the Japanese. Eighty per cent of their team was from New Zealand and Tonga. I am proud of my small team which is full of Georgians representing Georgia.""

He was a little rough on Canada but not all wrong.

Seven of the Japan starting side were foreign-born, including captain and flanker Michael Leitch, who was born in New Zealand but moved to Japan as a teenager. He returned to New Zealand this year to play for the Chiefs in Super Rugby.

Japan has been criticized in the past for being filled with foreign-born players, but Australian-born coach Eddie Jones has worked to promote home-grown talent, while trying to keep Japan competitive. Since the 2011 Rugby World Cup, he's added only five players through residency.

But eligibility remains a hot topic, whether players qualify by three-year residency or a grandparent in the distant past. World Rugby said it is reviewing the rules, but it's not hard to imagine it will remain controversial.

Coach Vern Cotter stirred up Scotland when he picked John Hardie, who qualified thanks to a Scottish grandmother, in the Rugby World Cup only five weeks after he arrived from New Zealand and with 57 minutes of international playing time. That might have been fine, but Hardie was chosen at the expense of regular Blair Cowan and John Barclay, who had just come out of a two-year exile.

Hardie calmed the critics, somewhat, with a second good show in the loss to France in Paris in the final warm-up.

Four years ago, Argentina, Georgia, and Romania had entirely homegrown teams.

This year, only Argentina does.

Georgia has only one foreign-born player, centre Merab Sharikadze, born in Russia to Georgian parents who returned home.

Romania has five, after the Oaks decided to beef up in search of their first quarterfinal. Three of the players qualified on residency this year, all of them aged around 30.

New Zealand-born flyhalf Mike Wiringi received a cap in June, and South African-born lock Johannes van Heerden and Tongan-born centre Paula Kinikinilau made their debuts less than two weeks ago in the home loss to Tonga.

Samoa tops the list with the most foreign-born players with 15, all from neighbour New Zealand, after prop Census Johnston came out of retirement as an injury replacement last week for his third World Cup.

Tonga was next with 12, including nine Kiwis with Tongan parents, followed by Scotland and Wales with 11 each.

Scotland included South African-born No. 8 Josh Strauss, even though he doesn't qualify on residency until Friday, when the tournament starts.

The next highest with 10 each were Japan, and France, which has picked four on residency since the last World Cup.

On nine were Australia, Italy, and the United States, which used to be at the lower end of the list, but has included three players this year on residency alone.

New Zealand, often accused of pillaging the Pacific Islands, led a group with five, including Ireland, Canada, and Romania. Only two All Blacks were born in the Pacific islands: Malakai Fekitoa (Tonga), and Waisake Naholo (Fiji), while five more were of Samoan descent.

The list finished with England (3), Fiji (2), Namibia (2), South Africa (1), and Uruguay (1).",13403e16-00e3-4e81-bcf8-28dd6adf983c,News,2015-09-15T21:40:50Z,Brandon Sun,3 Six Nations sides among the top-6 teams with most foreign-born players at Rugby World Cup,0.0,Blog

6229,"Geckos’ adhesive system becomes stiffer as they become l…  
It is widely known that geckos and lizards employ dry adhesion system using a combination of microscopic hairs (setae) on their toe pads as well as other aspects of internal anatomy to climb on vertical walls and run on ceilings. Though adult geckos can weigh as much as 300 g, the ease with they climb vertical walls remains the same. 

Geckos and lizards employ a mechanical principle called contact splitting. Each of the microscopic hairs found on their feet split up into hundreds of flat tips. The ends temporarily rearrange electrons on the walking surface, creating an electrodynamic attraction. 

The classical view is that as the body size of geckos increases, the size of the climbing structure (toe pad area) also increases to account for the maximum adhesive force required for climbing. However, increasing the surface area of gecko toe pads cannot by itself explain this. 

About 22 per cent of maximum adhesive force cannot be accounted for even after taking into account the increased area of the toe pad. Hence, some other critical factor besides pad area is required to provide the additional adhesive force. 

In a study published in PLOS ONE, Duncan J. Irschick from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Massachusetts, U.S.A. and one of the corresponding authors of a paper found that the bodies of geckos act much like springs and that, as geckos become larger, they also become stiffer, thus enabling them to climb as efficiently as smaller geckos. 

“In order for maximum adhesive force to increase for a constant or conserved contact area, the entire adhesive system must become stiffer in the direction of loading,” they write. 

Thus the adhesive system of larger geckos will be a lot stiffer than those of smaller geckos when they climb a vertical wall, assuming that the ratio of toe pad area to body mass remains the same. “The gecko adhesive system becomes less compliant (stiffer) as geckos become larger,” they write. 

The researchers found that as gecko body size increased, their complete adhesive system, that is, the tendons, skin, connective tissue and setae, became stiffer, resulting in the larger animals' legs and feet being far stiffer than those of smaller geckos. 

While the relationship between maximum adhesive force and stiffness has been proposed for synthetic adhesives and for only one species (Gekko gecko), the authors tested the maximum adhesive force and stiffness in six gecko species. 

They found larger geckos had a far stiffer adhesive system compared with…",3357bcdd-57d9-49e3-a0d0-2b07c3489046,News,2015-09-06T11:35:01Z,MyInforms,New insights into how geckos climb walls,0.0,Blog

This glowing orb was caught on security cam and I think the only reason we can see it is because its an infrared camera. Infrared catches light that the human eye cannot see. This is a energy being. Many sightings have shown these objects and they always appear alive and conscious. They seem to be very curious about everything and most often get caught on animal cams since they like to observe  wildlife.

4886,"This week in class we continued our discussion of the Koran, specifically in regard to its editing/compilation and subject. I found the five different “stages” of the Koran’s history to be very interesting, especially Stage 2 (Abu Bakr). Before taking this class, I would have never thought that the writing down of the Koran was at one time up to debate; I would have thought that people would want their religious texts preserved in writing, without question. However, after discussing why Abu Bakr questioned whether or not the Koran should be written down – how could he do something even Prophet Muhammad hadn’t even done? – I feel as though I have a much better understanding of Islam and its prophet’s role within the religion. It has become very clear to me that Muhammad was/is greatly revered by followers of Islam; while this was something was was aware of before taking this class, I never realized to what extent. As a non-religious person, I find this type of devotion to be unfamiliar yet fascinating.

I agree with @freebird27's opinion on the movie A Separation. I think the film provided a great look at the culture of Iran and its people. I was especially interested in the movie’s take on women’s roles in the family and the differences between social classes. A Separation certainly seemed to assert the idea that women in the upper class, such as Simin and even Termeh, are given more respect than those in the lower class, such as Razieh. For example, Simin’s husband remains relatively calm towards her throughout the movie (most of it, anyway) despite their impending divorce. In contrast, Razieh’s husband is quick to anger and accuse her of wrongdoing. Simin, as part of the upper class, also has more autonomy; I highly doubt Razieh’s husband would have let her leave the house as Simin did (and not only because he has major anger issues). Overall, the contrasts made between the classes in A Separation provided interesting social commentary and added to the depth of the film and its meaning(s).",6c46bbe6-474e-4195-9e3d-a94e133c5bca,Blog,2015-09-24T00:55:08Z,Islam students at LUC,Blog Post 4,1.0,News

They have been through this conversation almost a dozen times. Now he was really tired of this relationship. It’s been 2 years. He had tried a lot to make it work. He has sacrificed a lot. He has crossed all his limits. And he loved her more than anything. A boy loves with all his heart. A girl loves with her brain. A boy will love the girl without knowing her, her family, her tastes, her likes, her dislikes and then try to fit into her image of a good boyfriend/husband. A girl also starts to love without knowing anything, but then rest of the relationship she tries to modify or reshape the boys interest, his style, his likes, his dislike, his passions and even his way of thinking. For a boy it’s, “if you are with me I’ll do anything for you”. But for a girl it’s “if you do this, this and this, for me than I will ‘think’ about you”. A boy will convince his family, his friends and relatives for her. But a girl will not do the same and instead say, how can I. A girl needs a secure future, a stable monthly income, a good house, a good car, a high-profile school for her children. And that too when she is 23 and the boy is 24. She won’t allow the boy some time to earn and settle down. She wants it now and once for all. “Ok”, he said and went up to the billing corner, paid off the bill and left her sitting alone.

2807,"If you plan to buy a home with financing, you may feel overwhelmed by everything you need to learn about the process . Here are five key points to get you started. 
 Understand the full cost of owning a home  
There are four main categories of a homeowner’s monthly housing payment - principal, interest, taxes and insurance (P.I.T.I.) . 
 
Principal and interest comprise your monthly mortgage payment. The principal pays down your loan balance monthly, and the interest pays your fee for borrowing the money. Use an amortization calculator  to see the principal-versus-interest breakdown over time. 
 
Taxes refer to property taxes assessed by the county you live in, and average 1.2 percent of your home’s value each year. 
 
Homeowners insurance is required when you have a mortgage, and you pay it to an insurance company of your choosing. Insurance typically costs $700 to $1,200 per year for a single family home. 
 
In addition to P.I.T.I., if you live in a planned unit development (PUD) or condo, you'll have homeowners association dues, which cover common area amenities, ongoing upkeep, and reserves for future maintenance. These monthly dues range from $100 to over $1,000. 
 
If you don’t live in a PUD or condo, you should construct your own savings plan for future maintenance. 
 Examine your credit history now  
A strong credit report is critical for getting the best mortgages with the lowest rates. Lenders want reliable on-time payment history, as well as credit depth. 
 
Your report will be more appealing to lenders if you have a significant amount of credit. If you need to obtain more credit, note that your credit score can drop 5-15 points when you first open a new account, then will rise again when you’ve established good payment history, so it’s best to open new accounts a few months before applying for a mortgage. 
 
Federal law entitles you to a free credit report every year , but these reports only show account history, and don’t include scores. 
 
Get your credit score , and take steps to improve it , if necessary. 
 Match mortgage products to your budget and timeline  
You can calculate how much you can afford to spend on a home  with inputs you already know: income, monthly non-housing debt, and savings for down payment. 
 
Next, you need to think about how long you’re going to be in a particular home so you can target the right loan product . 
 
If your income isn’t going to grow over time, you will probably be in the home longer term, so you’ll want a loan with a payment that won’t change, like a 30-year fixed . 
 
Or maybe you expect your income to increase sharply within five years and you’re going to upgrade homes within that time, so you’ll want a five-year ARM , which has a much lower rate. 
 
If you don’t have a 20-percent down payment , you can buy with as little as 3 percent down using FHA , VA , Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac low-down programs , but you’ll have mortgage insurance on top of your monthly P.I.T.I. 
 
Estimate your mortgage insurance with a mortgage calculator . 
 Get pre-approved in advance  
If you do all your home financing research without getting pre-approved , you could be disappointed when it comes time to find a home. 
 
Home shopping is competitive, and most sellers require your offer to be submitted with a lender pre-approval letter to prove you’re all ready with your financing. 
 Know what lenders will require  
When you’re ready to get pre-approved, remember that lenders will closely examine all aspects of your life. 
 
They’ll ask for full name, address, date of birth, social security number, and ages of children. They’ll also review your credit report, employment history, pay stubs, tax returns, bank statements, divorce and any other legal settlements, and full financials for any businesses you own. 
 
A lender will give you a checklist outlining exactly what documents they need. Follow this checklist exactly. If they only ask for your last two pay stubs, don’t send three. If they only ask for federal tax returns, don’t send state. 
 
Also, be prepared to write short letters to explain past inquiries on your credit report, past addresses, and name changes. 
 
Now that you've got an overview, you can dive deeper into home financing topics , then find a lender in your area  to partner with you through the process.

413,"I love health success stories. Who doesn’t?  
Many of the “Before and After” stories we see online are related to weight loss. Getting that bikini shot after losing 50 pounds is fine and all, but I find the stories about overcoming chronic illness far more inspiring. 
 
That’s why I’m stoked to share one of my student’s testimonials about her experience going through the Paleo Rehab: Adrenal Fatigue program. 
 
Leslie* contacted me after I asked the Paleo Rehab group to share their personal health journey related to their identification of HPA axis dysregulation (AKA “ adrenal fatigue “) and the health improvements they had after implementing the recommendations from the program. 
 
When Leslie told me our program “saved her life”, I had to find out more. Even I was in disbelief that our program could help someone achieve that level of health success from Paleo Rehab . 
 
How could our online program have saved someone’s life? 
 
Leslie was kind enough to share her story publicly, for which I’m so grateful. I hope her experience gives you hope and confidence that you too can find the root of your health problems and begin overcoming them today . 
 
Thank you for your story Leslie! <3 
 
*Name has been changed for privacy. 
 Leslie’s Story  
Three years ago my health changed overnight, and my life went on hold. 
 
I would wake up every night around 1am with internal tremors in my neck, back and abdomen. They became progressively stronger throughout the night and I couldn’t sleep – sometimes for days at a time. They felt like I was having a seizure but I wasn’t. Occasionally the symptoms would happen during the day but for the most part it was at night. The conventional doctor initially thought it was a vitamin deficiency but I didn’t improve with supplementation. 
 
Months passed living with these symptoms. The sleep deprivation was debilitating. I couldn’t understand why it was happening every night at the same time. The doctor thought it was stress and the only stress I had was from not knowing what was wrong with me. 
 
I thought my symptoms might be spine related so I went to see a Chiropractor and he was the first one to suggest “adrenal fatigue.”  He suggested I purchase Dr. Wilson’s book but when I read it the symptoms didn’t sound like mine, at the time, so I didn’t give it any more thought.  Over the years I forgot about it. 
 
Next I tried Osteopathy treatments for two years and I was told that I have a nervous system imbalance and could be fixed with osteopathy and acupuncture but it would take time. I was willing to give it time and went for treatment twice a week but there was no improvement.  During this time I decided to see a Naturopath and when I described my symptoms he looked at me with a little smile and said nothing. He offered no possible explanation. 
 
I went back to the conventional doctor who prescribed an MRI – the results were normal.  Then I had blood tests, x-rays and ultrasounds to rule out other conditions – they were normal. He thought the symptoms were probably menopausal and said that I am lucky because women who have hot flashes suffer more.  My condition was not considered as bad as hot flashes.  Basically, in a polite way, I was told to suck it up.  I didn’t know where to turn to for help. It was a terrible feeling to know that something was wrong and I didn’t know where to go for help. 
 
I felt abandoned and alone. 
 
I decided to try another Naturopath who said my symptoms were due to an underactive thyroid.  After a few months on thyroid supplementation there was no improvement and I was feeling worse with additional symptoms – severe muscular pain every morning for 2 to 3 hours, low blood sugar and lack of energy – almost bedridden. With each appointment I complained about them and one day she realized it was low cortisol, which she called Adrenal Fatigue.  She gave me an adrenal supplement but the other ingredients in this supplement didn’t agree with me and I had to stop taking it. 
 
She offered little help with my diet even though she had a nutritional background.  When I explained that I was having a very difficult time controlling sugar levels and that I was eating almost every hour and a half during the day and several times throughout the night she gave me another supplement to balance sugar levels but it didn’t work. 
 
Desperate for answers I went to see an endocrinologist wondering if it really could be menopausal.  The endocrinologist said that I didn’t have an adrenal problem, that there is no precursor to Addison’s disease, that I didn’t have a blood sugar problem, and that what I have is a result of a stressful life. He said that those who have had a stressful life will have “one heck of a time when they reach menopause”.  He recommended hormone replacement therapy to get me over the hump for the next two years but I refused to take it because of the bad side effects. I didn’t need any more ailments to deal with. 
 
During the day I tried to get some sleep. I was lucky if I got an hour or two.  Any vitamins I tried to take made me severely dizzy for hours or made my hands tremble.  Walking across the room felt like I was going to drop to the ground from severe exhaustion and not only physical exhaustion but I felt an internal exhaustion like I was crumbling on the inside. All I wanted to do was stay in bed and rest. 
 
Every night I was in survival mode.  Eat or pass out.  
 
Hungry or not I had to eat to keep my sugar levels up and most of the time – actually all of the time – I was not hungry at all and had to force the food down.  Eating several times during the night never gave me a restful sleep and I kept my husband awake too.  I had to get up so frequently that it would wake him.  Sometimes the sugar levels were so low that I’d be trembling and crying from fear and frustration. He’d get up to sit with me in the kitchen until my body absorbed the food and the symptoms settled down.  That was a regular event.  He was worried about my health, which then started to affect his. 
 
When I heard about the Paleo Rehab program I joined hoping that I could, at the very least, learn one or two things that would help me feel a bit better. 
 
This program gave me much more than that. I am on my way to being normal again. 
 
After joining this program I made some diet changes: I increased protein, carb, fat and fiber intake in the recommended ratios.  I ate super foods, such as liver, and my muscular pain improved within a week while stabilizing my blood sugar.  To eliminate the muscle pain completely I increased soluble fiber and over a two-week period it worked – the pain is gone!  I’ve been pain-free for 6 weeks now and my blood sugar is stable.  I used to eat 8 meals a day plus 1 to 3 snacks throughout the night and now I am down to 5 meals and the occasional bedtime snack if I don’t eat enough calories during the day. 
 
I can finally sleep through the night. Finally. No more tremors. Adding meditation and a few, easy lifestyle changes to my daily routine has helped a lot too. 
 
I am also working one-on-one with Kelsey Marksteiner on individualized supplementation due to other health conditions that need attention. After 2 weeks of starting the new supplementation my blood sugar problems feel almost non-existent – the best they’ve ever been.  I know the sugar problem is there and I am in the healing stages so I won’t do anything crazy like go on a restrictive diet and act like it’s not a problem.  I know the problem is still there, but it does feel like it’s getting back to normal. 
 
I am healing. 
 
My energy level is still low but I am confident that it will improve as well.  I know what and how much to eat to get and keep myself healthy. Today I understand that the tremors I had were caused from adrenaline peaks occurring around 1am and lowering blood sugar levels.   Cortisol is supposed to kick in to raise it but mine never did and my sugar levels remained low.  I was miserable every day from sleep deprivation, exhaustion and pain.  I stopped driving because I was afraid I’d fall asleep at the wheel. 
 
Once I started sleeping through the night I was in a better mood – happier – and I could go out and do the things I used to do. My husband is so happy to see me getting back to normal – and so am I. 
 
Would you believe that I had spent close to $10,000 on healthcare practitioners with nothing to show for it?   
 
It’s hard to enjoy life when you don’t feel well and I was not going to give up on finding someone who could help me. I am so happy that I found the Paleo Rehab program .  The amount and the quality of the material are impressive and it is obvious how much time – and love – was put into it.  It is more than I ever expected. 
 
Laura and Kelsey – you saved my life. 
 
Yes, that is exactly how I feel and I am not ashamed to say it even though it may sound exaggerated.  What I went through was horrible and only my husband knows the extent because he was there to witness it. 
 
You helped me when no one else could and I don’t know where I’d be without you.    
 
Thank. You. So. Much.

184,"Dame Joan Collins said she used to ""nag"" her sister Jackie about getting mammograms but she ""refused"". 
 
		 
Jackie, who sold more than 500 million novels in more than 40 countries in her  four decades-long career as a writer in raunchy female fiction, died of breast  cancer last Saturday aged 77. 
  Joan and Jackie Collins during the filming of the 2013 New Year's Eve Graham Norton Show   
Dame Joan said she and her sister were ""thick as thieves"" but admitted they did have ""estrangements"" in the past. 

			 
Despite being diagnosed six-and-a-half years ago, British author Jackie, who lived  in Beverley Hills, told few people about her illness, saying she did not want to  ''burden'' others with it. 



 
In an online post called A Tribute To My Beloved Sister, Dame Joan wrote: ""I used to nag my sister about getting mammograms, as our darling mother Elsa had succumbed to the disease in 1962 when she was only in her early fifties. 

""I was religious about doing mammograms regularly. Jackie however refused - she didn't even like going to doctors. Like my brother and I she was needle-phobic."" 

Dame Joan, who said she and Jackie were "" thick as thieves"", also revealed the moment Jackie rang her to say she had stage four breast cancer. 

She only found out about her sister's illness in the fortnight before her death. 

			 
She said Jackie told her that she did not want to upset her, adding that she said: "" I know all the problems you've been having in the past few years - I didn't want to burden you with mine."" 

Dame Joan wrote: ""My voice was so choked with tears I could hardly speak."" 

The pair, who had been rumoured at times to have a difficult relationship, were pictured together in London just a few days before the death when Jackie was on a promotional tour for her new novel The Santangelos. 

In her tribute, Dame Joan wrote: ""Jackie really enjoyed her life so much and lived it to the hilt, and when we were together, even if we hadn't seen each other for a few months, we were thick as thieves."" 

			 
Dame Joan said Jackie ""hated"" her fourth husband Peter Holm, adding: ""She begged me not to marry him but unfortunately I went ahead - one of the worst decisions of my life. Jackie and I didn't see each other so much during that period."" 

She went on: ""Unfortunately, a couple of years later another relationship I had came between us and, having moved back to Europe, we couldn't be as close as we wanted to be. 

""Sisters will have their estrangements but happily when that relationship ended and I moved back to LA Jackie and I resumed our devotion to each other."" 

She added: ""I've never had a better girlfriend than Jackie, with whom I shared so much in common and could enjoy talking and gossiping away about everything when we were together, going to our favourite restaurants or to the movies or on long distance phone calls."" 

In her concluding few lines, Dame Joan said: ""I don't think I will ever recover from the sadness of losing my beautiful baby sister."" 

			 
She added: ""She will live on in the wonderful memories I have of her from our childhood and particularly from the last fifteen years, during which we were closer than ever. I feel her spirit, I hear her wonderful laugh and I see her all the time in the hundreds of photos of her that are sprinkled around my home. 

""She wasn't just a star - to me she was an entire galaxy."" 

Dame Joan has requested that people who read her online tribute make donations to Penny Brohn Cancer Care in the UK and the Susan G. Komen breast cancer organisation in the USA.

"" 10:00 PM: MORE than five years after Tony Abbott took the Liberal Party leadership from him, former leader Malcolm Turnbull returned the favour in Canberra on Monday. 

After deciding not to challenge Mr Abbott for the leadership during Mr Abbott's ""near-death experience"" in February, Mr Turnbull ended weeks of speculation calling for a ""new style of leadership"". 

After a late party room meeting, Chief Government Whip Scott Buchholz announced Mr Turnbull had won the leadership ballot 54 votes to Mr Abbott's 44 votes. 

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop remains as Deputy Liberal leader, switching her allegiance to Mr Turnbull and defeating contender and Abbott ally Kevin Andrews 70 votes to 30. 

Mr Turnbull had originally lost the Liberal leadership to Mr Abbott by one vote in 2009, due to his support for a carbon price system at the time. 

Pending official appointment by Governor-General Peter Cosgrove, Mr Turnbull will sit the remainder of this week in Canberra as Prime Minister-designate. 

WA MP Luke Simpkins, who brought on the unsuccessful spill earlier this year, told media it was time for a ""new beginning"". 

""I think the Prime Minister Tony is a great guy and a man of great principle… but unfortunately people just weren't listening anymore,"" he said. 

""It was difficult to get a message through and we're not looking forward to a new beginning.""

BOOKIES PICK TURNBULL TO WIN SPILL 8PM Abetz: 'changing leaders does not win elections' 

THE number of politicians weighing in on the Liberal leadership spill continues as Australia waits for the results from the party room meeting. 

Key Cabinet allies of Mr Abbott so far include Eric Abetz, Kevin Andrews, Peter Dutton, Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss and Treasurer Joe Hockey. 

Former Victorian Liberal premier Jeff Kennett has also voiced his support for Tony Abbott, going so far as to call Mr Turnbull a ""self-centered, selfish individual"". 

""It's always been about you. You and K Rudd have so much in common,"" he wrote. 

Mr Kennett later told media Mr Turnbull was opportunistic and had committed an act of ""gross disloyal extreme egotism"". 

He labelled him ""without a doubt, the Kevin Rudd of the Liberal Party"". 

""We must be the laughing stock to the world… to John Key in New Zealand to David Cameron in the United Kingdom…,"" he said. 

Mr Abetz said the public expected team work and team work. 

He said good leaders had clear values, policy consistency and integrity. 

""The flood of messages …. (are) clear - keep Tony Abbott as Prime Minister and don't behave like the Labor party did,"" he said. 

""Changing leaders does not win elections. 

""Tony Abbott won the last election and he will win the next. 

""His focus has been creating job, pursing economic growth, national security and developing the infrastructure needed for the 21st century. 

""Overwhelmingly the messages of support into our office is Tony Abbott is the choice … as Prime Minister."" 

The ballot is due to take place at 9.15 pm tonight.

Meanwhile, the realm of social media is trying to find the humour in Australia's political turmoil. 

The hashtag #putoutyouronions is trending, referring to the Prime Minister's penchant for biting into whole raw onions. 

EARLIER: Abbott: 'there will be a ballot tonight and I expect to win' 

A BALLOT for the Liberal party leadership and deputy leadership will be held tonight. 

Prime Minister Tony Abbott called a press conference this evening to announce the meeting. 

He reminded voters of his government's achievements including stopping the boats, tax cuts and increased jobs.

""The disloyalty of some has been outrageous,"" he said. 

""We must not become a carbon copy of the Labor party."" 

""You have the right to hire and only you have the right to fire. 

""The Australian people deserve better. 

""The PM has my absolute loyalty, as I have his."" 

Deputy Prime Minister and Nationals leader Warren Truss said his Coalition agreement was with Tony Abbott and a new deal would need to be renegotiated if there was a leadership change. 

""Tony Abbott has been a very inclusive leader and we've achieved a great deal together,"" he said. 

""The Nationals remain steadfast and united in delivering our agenda with new gains for regional Australia. 

""And we want that to continue into the future."" 

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said Mr Turnbull has supported two bad budgets, rising unemployment, cuts to pension and a collapse in confidence in our economy. 

""He's ambitious for himself, not our nation,"" he said 

""Australians rejected MT when he was opposition leader because he was out of touch … arrogant. Nothing's changed. 

""Australia needs a change of government and Labor will be up for the fight no matter who the Liberal party selects."" 

Turnbull challenges Abbott: 'we need advocacy not slogans' 

COMMUNICATIONS Minister Malcolm Turnbull has resigned from Cabinet and met with the Prime Minister this afternoon to request a ballot for the party leadership. 

Julie Bishop has also met with the Prime Minister today on the same issue. 

Speaking to the media this afternoon, Mr Turnbull said he has made his decision based on the urging of ""many people over a long period of time."" 

""Now this is not a decision that anyone could take lightly. I have consulted with many, many colleagues, many Australians, many of our supporters in every walk of life,"" he said 

"" It is clear enough that the Government is not successful in providing the economic leadership that we need. It is not the fault of individual ministers. 

""Ultimately, the Prime Minister has not been capable of providing the economic leadership our nation needs. He has not been capable of providing the economic confidence that business needs. 

""Now we are living as Australians in the most exciting time. The big economic changes that we're living through here and around the world offer enormous challenges and enormous opportunities. 

""We need a different style of leadership. We need a style of leadership that explains those challenges and opportunities, explains the challenges and how to seize the opportunities. A style of leadership that respects the people's intelligence, that explains these complex issues and then sets out the course of action we believe we should take and makes a case for it. We need advocacy, not slogans. 

""We need to respect the intelligence of the Australian people."" 

Mr Turnbull said if Tony Abbott led the party into the next election, Labor would be sure to win. 

""We have lost 30 Newspolls in a row. It is clear that the people have made up their mind about Mr Abbott's leadership."" 

A spill ballot will be held tomorrow. 

Mr Abbott survived a leadership challenge in February by 61 votes to 39. 

EARLIER: Knives out for Abbott: ""This time they will get him"" 

PRIME Minister Tony Abbott will face a leadership spill before the year is out, according to news reports today, with senior Ministers claiming this time ""they will get him''. 

The ABC reported it had spoken to eight ministers and six believe Mr Abbott will be challenged no matter what happens at the Canning by-election in Western Australia next Saturday. 

""And this time I think they will get him,"" one minister said. 

A double-digit swing against the Liberal Party in Canning would fuel the unrest. 

Both the News Limited Galaxy poll and the Fairfax Ipsos poll point to a 10-point swing. 

The Ipsos poll has the Liberal Party leading Labor after preferences are distributed by 52 to 48 per cent - it was 62 to 38 per cent at the 2013 general election. 

""And that's after we spent $1 million on that seat to save the Prime Minister, and Labor has spent nothing,"" one Cabinet minister said. 

""He said: 'Give me six months.' Well, he has had six months and things have gone from bad to worse. 

""He should just resign."" 

Fairfax reported a savage swing in friendly LNP territory in WA would be a 'political death threat to the Abbott government''. 

The Abbott government has now been in a losing position in the national polls for 18 consecutive months. 

MPs and Ministers are increasingly saying the problem comes from the PM's office and the way in which Cabinet processes are being bypassed. 

MPs and senators increasingly are losing confidence in Abbott's ability to turn the situation around, Fairfax reported.",918612c9-b7b8-4ad6-b359-fe077e1906c4,News,2015-09-14T13:08:22Z,Daily News,PM Turnbull: change is our friend,0.0,News

The New Apple TV 4 Specs: 2GB RAM, WiFi 802.11ac, No Optical AudioBy Oliver Haslam | September 11th, 2015 AdvertisementsApple’s new fourth-generation Apple TV is so much more than the media streaming device that it replaces, and that’s mainly down to the inclusion of a full-blown App Store, allowing developers to bring apps and gaming to the big screen. Apple demoed things like shopping apps during the device’s big unveiling, but it’s clear that the main target here is gaming. Lots and lots of gaming. If there’s one thing that game developers like to know, it’s what hardware they are dealing with. Unfortunately, Apple isn’t known for sharing just what internals its devices carry, and the new Apple TV’s specifications page on apple.com is suitably sparse, but all is not lost! In a break from the norm, Apple has detailed additional information about what is inside the fourth-generation Apple TV or, at least, it has to developers. As is always the case, though, it didn’t take long for those developers to tell the world. Thank you, devs! While we already had some inklings as to what was beating at the heart of the Apple TV 4, the complete list of specifications makes for an interesting reading. On top of the Apple A8 64-bit CPU that we already knew about, it appears that Apple’s new set-top box also ships with 2GB of RAM. That’s more than the iPhone 6, for example, and should see the Apple TV perform particularly well when it comes to handling cache from video streams. Did we mention gaming? Games like RAM! Another interesting tidbit is the fact that the Apple TV still does not ship with a gigabit Ethernet port, but it has 802.11ac WiFi, meaning the new 802.11a/b/g/n/ac WiFi will be quicker than plugging a cable into the back of the thing. Apple has also removed the optical audio output from the back of the new Apple TV, meaning the only way to get sound out of the device is via HDMI – a real shame to those with more interesting home audio setups. There are HDMI doohickeys that can get around this particular problem, but when an upgrade removes a port you’re already using, that never leaves a good taste in the mouth! That said, people complained when the floppy disk and then SuperDrive was removed from Macs, too. Following is a shot of the specifications on the official Apple TV page: And here are the specifications from developer documents, revealing RAM which isn’t mentioned publicly on the main Apple TV page on Apple’s website: 64-bit A8 processor 32GB or 64GB of storage 2GB of RAM 10/100Mbps Ethernet WiFi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac 1080p resolution HDMI New Siri Remote / Apple TV Remote Thoughts?

( NEWSER ) – An Indiana mom found a spider on her shoulder at exactly the wrong time—while she was backing out of her driveway on Friday. Authorities say Angela Kipp of Syracuse jumped out of her Dodge Avenger while it was still in gear ... and her 9-year-old son was in the back seat. The boy climbed into the front seat to try and stop the car, but accidentally pressed the gas instead of the brakes, WANE  reports.

Taxi drivers aren’t very happy with the ever-growing popularity of Uber’s business model . Earlier this summer, protestors against the car service got violent as some vehicles were on the receiving end of some pretty substantial damage. The anger amongst the taxi community against the likes of Uber and Lyft is nothing new, but it looks like this ill-will is not going away anytime soon. 
 
During Thursday night’s taping of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert , a protestor in the audience allegedly made his presence known during Colbert’s interview with Uber CEO Travis Kalanick . His message was clearly in support of New York City’s taxi industry which is, in his words, being “ruined” by the car service’s business model. 
 
BuzzFeed’s Rachell Zarrell was in attendance for the show and according to her update on Twitter , Colbert let the protestor talk: 
   
At Colbert, audience member started protesting the Uber CEO. Amazing how Colbert just let him speak.

Since taking photo and video are strictly forbidden during tapings of The Late Show , we currently do not have any visual evidence of the outburst in question. There is some time before the third episode of Colbert airs and it remains to be seen whether CBS will cut the outburst or include it in tonight’s broadcast. Here’s hoping the moment does make it to air, as Colbert seems to shine the most during unplanned incidents like these.

5021,"Longtime leading supplier of explosion proof lighting equipment Larson Electronics has announced the release of a Class 1 Division 2 integrated stainless steel LED light fixture for hazardous locations where gases and vapors stand the potential to exist.

Kemp, Texas (PRWEB) September 15, 2015 

The HALSS-48-2L-ITG-LED hazardous location light from Larson Electronics is a four foot single lamp integrated LED light fixture that is ideal for operators who seek a top quality, explosion proof light that reduces operating costs, improve lighting quality, and reduce down time from incurred frequent servicing intervals. This fixture is equipped with a specially designed integrated LED array which produces 19,200 lumens of bright light in a 116° by 126° wide flood beam spread. The integrated heat sink allows for efficient heat dissipation, preventing the LEDs from overheating and keeping the overall temperature of the fixture relatively low. The LED array is protected by stainless steel housing and a shatter and heat resistant clear acrylic lens secured with eight steel draw latches. This fixture carries a T4C temperature rating and is UL 595 and UL 1598A marine type approved for use in marine environments. This new fixture is weatherproof and provides operators in hazardous locations with a highly efficient, reliable, and affordable lighting solution for open areas where flammable chemicals and vapors may be present. This LED light fixture is surface mounted via two stainless steel L-brackets on each end of the fixture. The angle of the bracket is set by tightening two set screws on either side of the bracket. Once the brackets are mounted to a surface, the light fixture can be pivoted by loosening the cap screws, allowing users to angle the light for maximum illumination. The fixture may also be ordered for pendant mount applications. This class 1 division 2 fixture is universal voltage and operates on any voltage ranging from 90 to 305 volts AC or 127 to 431 volts DC. 

""This new integrated LED fixture provides operators with top of the line output in a compact form factor that certainly outperforms standard fluorescent fixtures most people use in hazardous locations,"" said Rob Bresnahan with Larsonelectronics.com. ""The solid state LED technology offered by this fixture provides operators with a more reliable, durable, and energy efficient lighting solution."" 

Larson Electronics carries an extensive line of LED light towers, portable power distributions, explosion proof lights for hazardous locations, portable work lights and industrial grade LED area lights.

1457,"Frustrated trainers have taken a swipe at officials about the absence of a group 1 sprint during Sydney's spring carnival before a star-studded cast assembles for The Shorts at Randwick. Frustrated trainers have taken a swipe at officials about the absence of a group 1 sprint during Sydney's spring carnival before a star-studded cast assembles for The Shorts at Randwick. Anointed the world's best sprinter by his trainer Joe Pride, the resuming Terravista heads up a mouth-watering group 2 dash over 1100 metres on Saturday.

But Terravista's cameo in Sydney could be limited to one – maybe two – starts before being whisked to Melbourne for the spring riches on offer down south.

Fellow Warwick Farm trainer Gary Portelli will saddle up Rebel Dane, one of three group 1 winners in The Shorts field, and remains perplexed that he will be forced to head across the border in search of another major.

""I can't understand why we only have two group 1 [open-age sprints] in Sydney [all season],"" Portelli said.

""All these stallions get retired to stud because there aren't that many options after their three-year-old group 1s. There are only a few on as four-year-olds. We breed sprinters – that's all we do – but we don't put races on for them.

""We seem to be putting on all this prizemoney for stayers when there's probably two or three chances in a race, whereas in this race the winner could come from anywhere.""

The state's premier trainer, Chris Waller, who will resume Delectation in The Shorts, said he was ""amazed"" by the absence of a short-course group 1 in Sydney during the spring.

""Look at this race ... it is a group 1-type of field; gee it will be tough to win,"" Waller said.

Rebel Dane ($9) and Delectation ($13) occupy the fifth and sixth lines of betting with Ladbrokes for The Shorts, with Terravista a dominant $2.60 favourite.

Portelli is bullish about his entire's chances after a throat operation and sharp barrier trial, but is mindful he has never run his stable star over anything less than 1200 metres in his career.

""That's why I've kept him fresh and haven't given him two hard trials,"" he said. ""Hopefully he will be warming up late and going quick enough to catch them up in front.

""Physically [the throat operation] has made a huge difference to him. He's a much happier horse and he looks bigger and stronger. He weighs 494 kilos now and that's something he's never weighed going into a race first-up. He's normally around 480 [kilograms]. He's ready to run a big race on the weekend.""

Waller will send Delectation back to the races on the back of a couple of trials after the gelding was a luckless ninth in the Stradbroke Handicap during the winter.

""He will have to be near his top to match it with some of these, but we are happy with him and he usually races well fresh,"" Waller said.

38,"A Hilo man was scheduled for a preliminary hearing on Thursday to face charges related to the theft of government vehicles and ukulele, according to Big Island police. 
 
On the afternoon of Sept. 9, the State Department of Agriculture reported that a white Dodge Dakota pickup truck had been stolen from state property on Lanikaula Street in Hilo and that the truck had rammed a chain link fence to exit the property. 

Later that evening, 26-year-old Blue Kela of Hilo was observed next to the open driver door of a truck matching the description of the state vehicle. The truck had fraudulent license plates and visible marks that logos had been removed from the front doors. Police confirmed that the truck was the one belonging to the state and arrested Kela on suspicion of first-degree theft. He was taken to the Hilo police cellblock while the Area I Criminal Investigations Section continued the investigation. 

Investigation revealed that Kela was also responsible for stealing two Jeep Cherokees belonging to the County of Hawai'i in August from parking lots on Aupuni Street. 

Investigation also revealed that Kela was responsible for stealing six ukulele from a Downtown Hilo store after damaging a door and breaking into the building on July 31. 

At 4:30 p.m. last Friday, he was charged with first-degree theft, second-degree theft, second-degree burglary, unauthorized entry of a motor vehicle, fraudulent use of license plates, two counts of criminal property damage and two counts of unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle. His bail was set at $53,000. His initial court appearance was Tuesday. 

His preliminary hearing was scheduled for Thursday afternoon in Hilo District Court.",dc5909f2-4054-4be0-867e-2eb5d69d97b6,News,2015-09-10T21:26:28Z,KITV 4,"Hilo man, 26, charged with theft of county vehicles, ukulele",0.0,News
2624,"A long long time ago, my best friend and I liked the same guy and instead of letting her have him, I agreed to go halvsies on him with her.

Just before they broke up a year later, he was talking to me and he said (and this is as verbatim as memory will let me be), ""If one of you breaks up with me, I'm probably going to break up with the other one. Together, you have everything I need, but apart, you just don't have enough value to keep me."" This should have been my first warning. He recanted this statement later, but I think it was always in the back of his mind, especially after poly and Dom gave him the tools he needed to try to enforce his arrogance. That and another quote he said around the same time (which I remember less clearly), "" I mean, no one should owe another person sex, but once she's agreed to a relationship, what am I supposed to do?"" or something like that.  Both of those add up to things: entitlement. Arrogance. I'm better than you. You are only as good as what you can give me.  That was the first year. And I get it: if you experience sexual needs, and you are bound to one partner, it seems like there's no outlet for your sex drive. But there are always options: masturbation, poly, cheating, or leaving the person whose needs clearly don't match up with your own.

There were six years of continual rape and gaslighting to make me feel like it was my fault. The last couple of years, I figured out that abuse was happening, but by them my image of reality was so skewed that I couldn't figure out if it we me or he who was the abuser. I eventually decided that it didn't matter and for both of our sanity, I needed to end it. It still boggles my brain how tightly he clung to me, especially after it became heart-shreddingly clear that we had oppositional needs. Even when our relationship devolved into nothing but him poking me, needing me to desire him for sex, and me refusing him and trying to interact with him in literally any other way; he still clung to me.  I broke up with him, and he persuaded me to get back together, even though nothing had changed and the resulting last few months of breakup were the same horrible the last 2 years had been.

And yes, it was rape. I see that now. When you tell someone repeatedly that sex hurts you, emotionally and physically, and there response is to try to mold you while you're in sub space into a slut (not just someone who desires sex. a slut, specifically.)  When the boundaries you discuss and the agreements you make while heads are cool and emotions are banked vanish like they were never there in the face of his desire.  When you break up with him and say you want to stop doing physical(sexual) stuff, but he cries and bleeds until you agree to phase it out slowly, rather than all at once.  When you actually try to phase it out and he screams at you about shutting him out of your life and that this lack of accessability is ""what he's been dreading all along"" and browbeats you into having more sex.  When you say ""casual friends with benefits"" and he hears ""poly girlfriend"" and blames you, not only for not having sex with him, but for his failure to get another girlfriend, because he ""doesn't think you're ready for him to move on.""  When you've been broken up for a year and wear a dress that he likes, and he gets you somewhere alone and tries to kiss you.  When you tell him you feel raped by him, and he asks you to ""use less inflammatory language.""  And you DO because your entire reality now consists of his pain and you would do anything for just one pain free breath of air. Yeah, that's rape.

However, I am NOT a rape victim. I have been raped, repeatedly for years, by someone I should have been able to trust, but I refuse to be a victim. I will process this, and use the anger that thinking about these circumstances engenders to set my boundaries and defend them. I will learn from my mistakes and make different ones next time. I will be clear in my desires and my boundaries and I will not allow anyone to push past them. I am going to therapy to see what else I can do to strengthen myself so this kind of thing does not happen again. I refuse to be a victim.",a255750a-01c0-4de4-a691-329cec3ddf4a,Blog,2015-09-16T20:22:12Z,Evolution in Progress...,"Mistakes were made, let's not forget.",1.0,News
9206,"The microgravity whisky glass for debonair space captains Scotch company Ballantine's designs a stylish drinking vessel engineered for sipping fine whisky in microgravity conditions. by Michelle Starr @riding_red September 6, 2015 9:26 PM PDT Updated: September 7, 2015 8:11 AM PDT The Space Glass, carefully designed to allow the drinking of whisky in space. It's a shame NASA doesn't. Ballantine's Sure, you could sip your freshly made espresso on the International Space Station. Or, you could channel your inner Scotty and sip on a fine single malt. And now, thanks to blended Scotch range Ballantine's, you won't even need to suck it out of a vacuum pouch. Instead, you can sip in style from a glass engineered to work in microgravity.
Unlike the space espresso cup designed by Portland State University, which has a peculiar shape, the Space Glass is designed to retain the shape of a whisky glass to keep the experience consistent with that of a terrestrial whisky-drinker. Instead, the interior of the glass is shaped so as to allow surface tension to keep the whisky from floating all over the place. The glass is primarily constructed of 3D-printed rose gold and 3D-printed plastic. A rose gold ""weight"" in the bottom of the glass is designed to look pretty and give the glass a pleasant heft in Earth gravity conditions (in microgravity, it makes no difference). It also has a special spiral pattern. The combination of the gold material and the spiral helps to increase surface tension, holding the whisky in a reservoir in the bottom of the glass.
The team chose 3D printing partially because the technology is so new and because of its steep trajectory. It's growing in leaps and bounds, with experimental machines now able to print in glass, sandstone, plastics, metals and other materials in one seamless print. There is also a 3D printer aboard the space station so that astronauts can fabricate small items as required, such as replacement parts or even espresso cups.
To control the flow of the liquid up the sides of the glass, a helix winds around the inside. This carries the whisky up to the rose gold mouthpiece, where it stays stationary until the drinker takes a sip. It also lets you know where the liquid emerges and provides a cold touch that plastic can't match. Meanwhile, a clear dome covers the top of the glass so that the drinker can see the liquid inside while it remains safely contained. The schematic of the Space Glass. Ballantine's In order to get the whisky into the glass in the first place, the base is fitted with a one-way valve. The glass sits snugly on a custom nozzle for the whisky bottle. This allows the liquid to enter the glass without having to be poured in. A magnet in the base allows the glass to be attached safely to a metal surface so that it doesn't float away.
""We are using inertia and the notion that the whisky will stay at rest while the bottle and the glass is moved around the resting liquid. Motion one pulls the whisky into the base of the glass, then motion two is to roll the whisky in your hand and let the heat transfer through the metal base into the liquid itself,"" explained James Parr of the Open Space Agency, who led the design of the Space Glass. ""Step three involves then moving the glass down prior to moving your nose into the space where the vapours are resting,"" he said. ""The final motion is to move the glass upwards to capture the liquid in the base plate and let it enter your mouth.""
The team tested the Space Glass at the University of Bremen's ZARM drop tower in Germany, a facility that simulates microgravity conditions. The glass, containing whisky, was filmed dropping down the length of the tower. Not only did the liquid cling to the baseplate, it made its way up the side of the glass, travelling along the helix.
Ballantine's didn't mention whether the glass was intended to be sent to space. Alcohol is prohibited aboard the International Space Station, but the glass could still be tested with non-alcoholic liquids. It also didn't mention whether there were plans to sell the glass here on Earth. I'd imagine it would be quite the classy collector's object. The distillery has not yet responded to request for comment. You can check out the glass in action and testing in the videos below.

2743,"Objections can not delay consumer case verdictObjections can not delay consumer case verdict FIRST PHASE In the consumer complaint case the party which files the case is called the Complainant and the party against whom the case is filed is called the Opposite Party / Opposite Parties. To cause a delay in the case of complaint by the Complainant the Opposite Party often raises Preliminary Objections. These objections may be the issues like limitation period under the law of limitation, jurisdiction of the consumer court, maintainability of the case among others, without touching upon the crux of the dispute – and demand that these be heard first and decided by the consumer court. Preliminary Objections may delay the proceedings of the case and thereby increasing the cost of litigation, leaving aside the main dispute. After resolving of the preliminary objections only, the main case is taken up on merits of each individual case. Objections can not delay consumer case verdict SECOND PHASE To delay the verdict, the Opposite Party then files Appeal against the Orders given by the consumer court on preliminary objections which had already been raised by the Opposite Party in the 1st phase. This technique is adopted by the Opposite Party to wear out the Consumer or the Complainant till the higher Courts. Some times, the Consumer becomes hopeless of the judgments and sometimes, the consumer blames his Advocate for not taking up the case before the consumer in proper manner. – CONCLUSIONS The only remedy for the Consumer in such cases is that, they should not allow piecemeal multiple rounds of dates on part issues.

1472,"Ophthalmology company Ocata Therapeutics (NasdaqGM:OCAT) said on Tuesday that it has treated the first atrophic (dry) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patient under its Phase 2 clinical trial using its proprietary RPE cells. 
 
The company added that the trial will evaluate the safety and explore efficacy as compared to a parallel control group. 
 
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) occurs when light-sensitive photoreceptor cells in the macula, located in the centre of the retina, break down causing vision loss. Photoreceptor breakdown is a consequence of loss or damage to the RPE layer. As the disease progresses, patients may have difficulty reading and recognizing faces. 
 
This Phase 2 study will include up to three cohorts of up to 20 subjects each. Each of the cohorts will receive one week of immune suppressive therapy prior to surgery and then different immune suppression regimens following transplantation of the cells, to determine the safety and tolerability of zero, six and 12 weeks of post-transplant systemic immune suppression. Untreated patients will receive placebo treatment similar in appearance and administration to those who have received cellular transplants. 
 
In conjunction, the interim top-line results from the first cohort is expected in the second quarter of 2016 and the interim read-out on the second two cohorts is expected by the end of 2016, concluded the company.",65f69879-7f8a-4957-ac23-f17d7eb95e1e,News,2015-09-09T08:05:47Z,Bloomberg,Ocata Therapeutics enrolls first dry AMD patient in Phase 2 clinical trial using proprietary RPE cells,0.0,Blog

492,"2015/18: Vicious -- V. E. Schwab
By the time the first bell rang, signaling the end of Victor’s art elective, he’d turned his parents’ lectures on how to start the day into: Be lost. Give up. give In. in the end It would be better to surrender before you begin. be lost. Be lost And then you will not care if you are ever found. He’d had to strike through entire paragraphs to make the sentence perfect after he accidentally marked out ever and had to go on until he found another instance of the word. But it was worth it. The pages of black that stretched between if you are and ever and found gave the words just the right sense of abandonment. [loc. 141]

Victor and Eli are roommates at college. Victor is somewhat introverted, prone to brooding and scheming and taking a Sharpie to the pages of books by his self-help guru parents. His friendship with Eli (political-candidate smile and general wholesomeness) seems mostly founded on the moments where Eli's cheerful, normal facade seems to crack. They are both intelligent, arrogant and competitive. And kind of doomed.

It's time for the two to declare their senior theses. Victor picks 'adrenal inducers' (fight or flight etc) but Eli, more ambitiously, decides to study ExtraOrdinaries: ""An argument for the theoretical feasibility of the existence of ExtraOrdinary people, deriving from laws of biology, chemistry, and psychology"". EOs are, effectively, superheroes: people with unusual gifts. None of them are familiar by name, though Spiderman and Superman are cited as examples of nurture and nature. Eli thinks that there is a very specific set of circumstances that will create an EO. Victor, more or less on the spur of the moment, offers to be the first experimental subject.

Vicious alternates between the events of a decade ago -- when Victor and Eli performed their experiments and Victor was imprisoned for murder -- and the 'now' in which Victor is ... keen, shall we say ... to meet up with his old college friend. Cue much discussion of heroes and villains, and the recruitment of former cellmate Mitch and 12-year-old runaway Sydney Clarke to Victor's team. We don't get to see much of Eli and his cohorts, which is a shame, because the novel does occasionally feel imbalanced. But Vicious is nevertheless a well-paced, well-plotted novel with a lot of dark humour (and dark stuff that isn't at all funny) and an interesting spin on the notion of the superhero -- and the inevitable inverse, the supervillain. Is Victor a villain? He does some things that are not at all nice. Is Eli a villain? But he seems so wholesome. 

I think I probably picked this up as part of my 'pictureless books about superheroes' kick. I'm glad I got around to reading it.

2948,"(CNN) -- Thank an ancient squirrel, climate change and French scientists for the new discovery of an ancient virus, Mollivirus sibericum, that sounds like it could launch a creepy movie. 
""Actually there's already a science-fiction novel inspired by one of our last (discoveries). Look on Amazon,"" said Jean-Michel Claverie, a professor of medical genomics and bioinformatics at the University Of Mediterranean School Of Medicine in Marseille, France. ""But with the ancient squirrel, I can see where you might think movie."" 

The virus has been at rest for 30,000 about 30 meters deep in the Siberian permafrost. Astrobiologists using it as kind of stand-in for Mars have taken core samples looking for life. Claverie said he stumbled on research that described how reviving a plant from a seed that had been buried for 30,000 years. What intrigued Claverie was that the particular core sample came into contact with an ancient squirrel's nest. 

""And what do all squirrels do all their life? They store seeds for eating,"" Claverie said. Wondering what else they might find, he sent the scientists an email that launched collaboration between Russian and French research teams and led to several discoveries. 

Waking an ancient virus 

When Claverie's team got the sample, they knew they'd have to be careful to protect animals and humans from whatever was in it; they weren't sure if they'd wake up Captain America or the Winter Soldier. 

""We're not stupid enough to revive a virus that may pose a threat to human health,"" Claverie said. 

So, they went fishing. ""We use amoeba as bait to fish out whatever viruses may be in that specific sample,"" Claverie said. 

The amoeba was the type typically found in contact lens infections. The team grew them, then mixed in parts of the permafrost samples in a petri dish. Most of the time, nothing happened. 

""But every once in a while, we see them die and that's when we know somebody must be killing them,"" Claverie said. ""This way, we know which to isolate from the others."" Scientists say they are safeguarding the virus sample. 

Using this technique has led to several discoveries -- Mollivirus sibericum is the latest of four giant viruses found so far in this one sample. It's called a ""giant"" virus because you can see it under a light microscope, like a bacteria, and it has a large number of genes. 

The name comes from Molli, a hard-to-translate French word that essentially means something that is soft or flexible, Claverie said, and Sibericum for the location where it was found. 

""The name is a little mundane compared to the last giant virus we found 'the Pandoraviruses,'"" he said. ""Mollivirus sibericum, though could be as equally dangerous as what is in Pandora's Box, based on its behavior. 

""It was a very low concentration of these viruses that infected the amoeba. If you think about it, it's really scary that only a handful of particles might be sufficient enough to start an epidemic."" 

Which is why, in the paper Claverie and his team published in a recent edition of PNAS, they express concern about other ventures into the permafrost. 

What's hiding in the permafrost? 

As climate change has opened up new maritime routes through the arctic sea ice, Claverie and his team worry about the increasing number of companies already mining for gold and tungsten along the northern coast of Siberia. 

The companies will excavate millions of tons of permafrost that have lain undisturbed for thousands and thousands of years. 

If this one core sample yielded at least four giant viruses, there is no telling what frozen surprises could be suddenly exposed in open mining. 

""What may be in those layers is very worrying,"" Claverie said. 

But they may also hold great promise. Secrets there could unlock a new understanding of metabolic pathways and biochemical processes that could lead to the creation of new drugs and biotechnology. 

Or that ancient squirrel could lead us to something even bigger, Claverie wrote: ""Part of what we don't know might turn out to contain the explanation to fundamental questions such as the origin of life on our planet.""

598,"NEW YORK -- Theatergoers who check out ""Beautiful"" on tour won't get to see Tony winner Jessie Mueller but they may get the next best thing -- someone with her DNA. 

Mueller's older sister Abby has stepped into her sister's shoes to play Carole King in the Broadway musical about the celebrated ""I Feel the Earth Move"" songwriter. 

Abby Mueller acknowledged she was ""a little hesitant"" to audition for a part that earned her sister a best-actress Tony Award last year. 

""I'm really glad my agent convinced me to and I'm really glad they saw something in me. I've just been having the best time doing this,"" said Abby Mueller. ""As soon as I got the audition, I called Jessie. I was like, 'I've got a funny story for you.'"" 

Jessie and Abby Mueller are just the tip of the talented, Chicago-based Mueller family. Their brothers, Matt and Andrew, as well as their parents, Roger Mueller and Jill Shellabarger, are all actors. 

""Beautiful"" director Marc Bruni said Abby, who graduated from Indiana University and has been on Broadway in ""Kinky Boots,"" earned the job with her skills. 

""We did not set out to specifically cast within the Mueller family. Abby is an extraordinary talent in her own right,"" he said. 

""She is creating her own version of Carole that has all of the emotional resonance and all of the truthful acting that comes with the Mueller family and their amazing accessibility of emotion."" 

The tour kicks off in Providence, Rhode Island, on Tuesday. It makes stops in North Carolina, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Illinois, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Florida, Georgia, Texas, California and Colorado. 

One of the tour's highlights for Mueller will be spending the holidays and New Year's Eve in Chicago. ""It's going to be awesome. I'm thrilled,"" she said. ""I haven't been home for Christmas in years."" 

The musical tells the story of King and her first husband, Gerry Goffin, who together composed some of the greatest pop singles of the early 1960s, including The Shirelles' ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow,"" the Drifters' ""Up on the Roof,"" Bobby Vee's ""Take Good Care of My Baby"" and Little Eva's ""The Loco-Motion."" 

Book writer Douglas McGrath intertwines the story of King and Goffin with that of their friends and avid competitors, the songwriting team of Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, which opens another treasure trove of pop hits like ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'"" and ""Walking in the Rain."" 

Audience members get some history -- and some killer tunes. ""You learn something and you have your heart warmed. And you also have this catalog of music that is just unparalleled,"" said Bruni. 

It will be the first time on the road for Mueller, but not for Liam Tobin, who plays Gerry Goffin. The Canadian-born Tobin toured western Europe in ""West Side Story."" 

He didn't see the Broadway version until after starting tour rehearsals and said he loves digging into a character who struggles with mental illness and guilt. 

""It's been a real treat to go somewhere else with a character than just your classic leading man,"" he said. ""It's really a privilege to really dig in to something like Gerry."" 

Mueller, who grew up listening to King's landmark album ""Tapestry"" and recently met the songwriter, has been trying to tap into King's honesty and vulnerability. 

""Trying to do anything to be like Carole is instantly going to ring false,"" she said. ""Hopefully, when you're going for that truth and honesty, those are the essence that made people love Carole and hopefully that essence is what's going to carry the show.""

1942,"You just picked up some delicious takeaway, but you can’t dig in quite yet. Maybe you have to walk the dog, shoot off a quick email, or wait for someone else to get home. You can stick the takeaway in your microwave and close the door so it stays warm and tastes freshly cooked. 
 
You’re not actually turning the microwave on, however, just using the microwave as a way to insulate the food. Christine Gallary at The Kitchn tested the tip with glasses of water to see if the microwave does help, and it turns out it might buy you some serious time. No matter what you’re going to lose a lot of heat, but using the microwave as your takeaway storage can extend that “fresh takeaway window” by at least half an hour. Compared to setting in on the counter, where your food will start to rapidly cool instantly, it’s pretty helpful. If you have to wait for too long, though, you can always reheat it to make it taste as good as new.

5174,"Washington, D.C. ­– U.S. Senator John McCain (R-AZ) released the following statement today on the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Inspector General report confirming that more than 300,000 veterans have died after applying for health care benefits through the agency: 
 
“I am deeply disturbed that the VA Inspector General’s report released yesterday substantiated allegations that over 300,000 veterans have died after applying for health care benefits through the VA. It is extremely troubling that there are another 500,000 veterans who have also applied for their health care benefits and are languishing in a bureaucratic black hole awaiting their care. 
 
“VA Secretary Bob McDonald was brought on board over a year ago to fix these problems. Despite Congress providing tens of billions of dollars to the VA in additional funding for more employees and information systems, it is clear that he has not done so. 
 
“It is astounding that the VA IG’s report substantiated such horrific mismanagement at the VA on the determination of eligibility for benefits at a time when the VA recently claimed historic progress on its disability backlog. It is more disappointing that the IG only investigated this allegation at the direction of Congress. I commend House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller for demanding answers to this problem at the VA. 
 
“It is absolutely clear that the way ahead for reform of the VA must be to empower all veterans to immediately get the care they need where and when they need it – regardless of the location – and never allow bureaucrats to deny our nation’s heroes the benefits they deserve.”

1973,"Minnesota Power’s “Power Volunteers” will spring into action on Thursday to help hundreds of children and families in need gain access to some of the basics that many others take for granted. Working in assembly-line fashion, from 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., employee volunteers will gather in shifts on the plaza outside Minnesota Power’s General Office Building in Duluth to package toothbrushes, healthy snacks, warm socks and laundry soap for several nonprofit organizations that serve children and families in the region. The simple act of assembling a snack pack or dental kit is a big help to nonprofits that often can use an extra hand. By the end of the 2½ hour “Power Volunteering on the Plaza,” Minnesota Power employees will have packaged hundreds of packs and kits for four nonprofits: . Just Kids Dental. Assemble dental supply kits for youths to be distributed at schools. . YWCA Duluth. Create healthy snack packs to be distributed to children in after-school programs. . Lifehouse. Package socks and toe warmers to give to low-income and homeless teens. . CHUM.

3325,"No. 9 Hinsdale Central (5-0) at No. 2 Glenbard West (5-0) 
The facts: 1:30 p.m. on Saturday 
The storyline: The best game this week is between two undefeated West Suburban Silver teams. Both have been dominant this season and the winner will be the favorite for the conference title. For the Hilltoppers, running back Sam Brodner has been a touchdown machine this season and against previously undefeated Lyons he scored three touchdowns and ran for 130 yards to lead his team to a 35-0 win. Hinsdale Central has a high powered offense to match, boasting an impressive offensive line headed by Michigan State commit Matt Allen. 
 
No. 11 Naperville Central (4-1) at No. 13 Batavia (5-0) 
The facts: 7:30 p.m. Friday 
The storyline: Naperville Central continues on through its rugged schedule, this week travelling to non-conference foe Batavia for a matchup that should feature plenty offensive fireworks. Naperville Central’s biggest athlete is Iowa recruit Emmanuel Rugamba who made his name on the offensive side of the ball at wide receiver. He has also provided several game changing plays on defense as defensive back. A 75-yard Rugamba touchdown helped seal a win against Wheaton-Warrenville South 20-8 last week. Batavia quarterback Kyle Niemiec has accumulated over 1,100 yards passing this season. Running back Zach Garrett and wide receiver Canaan Coffey are two other Bulldogs to keep an eye on. 
 
No. 22 Conant (5-0) at No. 12 Barrington (5-0) 
The facts: 1 p.m. Saturday 
The storyline: Week 6 is all about ranked teams matching up, as another pair of undefeated teams face off in Barrington. Both teams won conference games last week: Conant beat Fremd 26-17 and Barrington is defeated Schaumburg 35-28. The Broncos’ defense has been solid this season behind quarterback Johnny Davidson who has brought the offense consistency and power. Conant quarterback Kyle Bradley has also been impressive and teamed up with running back Jake Jakubosky to run for nearly 300 yards against Fremd. 
 
No. 21 Marian Central (4-1) at No. 25 Notre Dame (4-1) 
The facts: 7:30 p.m. Friday 
The storyline: Marian Central is looking to rebound from a disappointing 41-3 loss to No. 8 Joliet Catholic last week. The Dons will provide another stiff test. Hurricanes running back Emitt Peisert led the way with 13 carries for 48 yards against the Hilltoppers. Despite the loss, Marian Central has had a big start to the season though, and look to continue their roll in the East Suburban Catholic against a tough Notre Dame team whose only loss was to Marist in Week 4. Western Illinois quarterback commit Tyler Tsagalis and the Dons have shown the ability to string together long drives and put up big numbers this season. 
 
Jacobs (5-0) at No. 18 Huntley (5-0) 
The facts: 7:15 p.m. Friday 
The storyline: No. 18 Huntley surged into the rankings this week and will be tested immediately against undefeated Jacobs. Huntley took down Cary-Grove 29-8 in its first Fox Valley Conference game of the season last week behind a big performance from sophomore wide receiver Eric Mooney. In fact, Huntley held the perennially powerful Cary-Grove offense scoreless until the fourth quarter. Jacobs junior quarterback Chris Katrenick is drawing plenty of recruiting attention from colleges and has Jacobs riding the momentum of a 49-17 win over Dundee-Crown last week.

6039,"Cyndi Lauper has a bucket list item to check off, and she's coming to Nashville to do it. The Grammy-winning pop icon is planning on recording a country album, for release in 2016. 
 Sidebar    Cyndi Lauper Talks 'Women Who Rock' »  
''I want to work with Tony Brown down in Nashville and do a country record, finally,"" she tells Bang Showbiz.   ""I want to record all those songs I used to sing my guts out in my apartment to! It'll be out next year.'' 
 
It's not clear if Lauper's country project will be all cover songs, as she hints, or also contain originals. But in choosing to work with Tony Brown, she's certainly inking a commitment to genre authenticity. Brown is the famed producer behind every album the King of Country, George Strait has released since 1992. His traditional country résumé also includes projects by Reba McEntire, Vince Gill, Wynonna, Patty Loveless and Brooks & Dunn, among many others. 
 
Lauper made the big announcement at Tuesday night's U.K. premiere of Kinky Boots , the Tony-winning musical for which she penned all of the music. Her Broadway/West End ventures and upcoming country album are just a few of the many projects the 62-year-old singer-songwriter-philanthropist-activist has on her plate. She's also planning musical collaborations with Seymour Stein, the Sire Records co-founder and award-winning producer who helped launch the careers of Madonna, the Ramones and the Pretenders, among many other pop and rock legends.

7250,"The environmental group Sierra Club recently ranked Baylor 133rd out of 153 schools in its Cool Schools ranking. The ranking measures participating universities’ commitment to on-campus sustainability. 
 
Factors taken into consideration in the rankings are water usage, food waste, energy consumption and environmental innovation, among others. High-ranking schools included the University of California Irvine, Colorado State University and Middlebury College in Vermont. All schools submitted reports voluntarily and schools that chose not to participate were not placed on the list. 
 
Smith Getterman, Baylor’s director of sustainability, acknowledges several of the challenges the school faces in becoming more environmentally friendly. 
 
“Geographically there are struggles, because of the weather in Texas. Our region is not Oregon. It presents its own set of challenges,” Getterman said. “We are here in the heart of Texas, and I get it all the time that we’re not in the Rockies or Middlebury, Vermont, where [the universities] have a farm. So it can be kind of hard to get motivated when you walk outside and the biggest mountain is the ALICO.” 
 
Getterman added that, as the only coordinator in his office, he does not have the outreach capabilities of better-staffed sustainability departments. 
 
Among the challenges that Getterman sees in increasing sustainability on campus is making students aware of programs like recycling and public transportation. Lafayette, Calif., senior Morgan Davis, the president of the sustainability student advisory board, said that many students remain apathetic about efforts to be environmentally friendly. 
 
“I’m from California, so I’ve always grown up recycling and caring about that stuff,” Davis said. “Coming here it was surprising that a lot of people weren’t aware.” 
 
One of Getterman’s primary goals is to increase student awareness of sustainability on campus. 
 
“We have continued to expand our recycling program and curtail waste on campus,” Getterman said. “That’s not super new and exciting, but it’s something that we continue to emphasize because there’s a whole new class of freshmen this year. There shouldn’t be any seniors on campus that don’t know about us, but there probably are. So we have to continually revisit some of the stuff that we started implementing years ago.” 
 
However, Getterman is not concerned with keeping up with the universities that are ranked above Baylor on lists like the Sierra Club’s Cool Schools. For instance, six years ago Baylor recused itself from the Presidents’ Climate Commitment, which binds participating universities to a set of goals and procedures to alleviate greenhouse gas emissions. Getterman noted that many of the schools that signed the agreement have failed to meet its targets. 
 
While maintaining a voice for sustainability on campus is important, he wants to do that in a way that is unique to Baylor. 
 
“I’ve really directed our program and the sustainability efforts into buying into the Christian mission of Baylor University, because that’s what makes us unique. We frame it in a Christ-centered, biblical approach.” Getterman said. “We want people to see how they live their daily life can be a way of living out the gospel to others who don’t know Christ. How can we expect people who don’t know Christ to see a reflection of him in us when we are trashing or misusing one of the first gifts he ever gave us?” 
 
Getterman presents this message through the sustainability department’s Instagram account, @osogreen, which showcases scenes of natural beauty on campus. He said he hopes this account, along with the other outreach efforts of the sustainability department, will inspire students to recycle, ride their bikes to campus, and otherwise do their part to make Baylor more environmentally conscious. 
 
Students with a particular interest in sustainability are invited to apply to join the sustainability advisory board or pursue a Green Meeting Certification, which authorizes that the meetings of students organizations are meeting several environmental criteria. 
 
“We’re trying to have a greater presence and make people more aware,” Davis said. “The Green Meeting Certification that encourages student groups to be thinking about these things. My goal is that this will be something that all clubs have to do.”",d07c739e-acd9-467c-b2fa-81c3ee21474e,Blog,2015-09-17T04:35:41Z,The Baylor Lariat,"BU recognized for environmental sensitivity, sustainable practices",1.0,Blog

5610,"HARLOTTETOWN, PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND, CANADA –  September 30, 2015 – ( Motor Sports Newswire ) –  A new motorcycle manufacturer, Havoc Motorcycles ( havoc-motorcycles.com ), has announced its launch, releasing details of its line-up of heavyweight motorcycles to be available for the 2016 model year. 
 

 
The flagship model, “Iron Flight: Mike Tyson Special Edition,” is a special edition produced under trademark license from iconic boxer and entertainer Mike Tyson . It features a 124 ci engine, and Mike Tyson’s iconic tattoo incorporated into an airbrushed paint scheme, with matching machined wheels and accessories. 
 
Displaying the first “Iron Flight” motorcycle to a packed house in Charlottetown , President of Havoc Motorcycles, Dr Jarrod Wiener , said, “We are passionately committed to making motorcycles that enable riders to symbolize their individuality, the source of their strength and freedom. We’re thrilled to be working with Mike Tyson and look forward to introducing riders to the Havoc Motorcycles lineup.” 
 
Havoc motorcycles will offer three models initially, all of the heavyweight cruiser type. All feature large displacement engines (113ci to 124ci). Each motorcycle is hand-crafted, featuring sculpted and molded bodywork of the ‘custom bagger’ style to offer enthusiasts a custom-inspired motorcycle right from the assembly floor. 
 
“We’ve all bought new motorcycles. On the sales floor, it’s the best machine available. Then you get it home, and the huge accessories catalog comes in the mail to improve it. You can rebuild the whole bike and still park it next to a nearly identical motorcycle in a parking lot. We build your Havoc Motorcycle the way you want it from the get-go,” says Wiener. 
 
Customers can personalize their motorcycles with a wide range of options from the factory, including a choice of wheels, billet accessories, powder-coating, anodizing, and paint finishes. Customers can even work with Havoc Motorcycles’ graphic designers and airbrush artists for a truly personal expression.

With a 124ci engine, and Mike Tyson’s legendary imagery airbrushed by hand, Iron Flight makes a statement of power and presence loud and clear. “Havoc is presence,” says Wiener. “It’s a no-nonsense statement of strength and individuality. What says that clearer than riding a Mike Tyson Special Edition.”

545,"A city panel Wednesday rejected a plan for a Family Dollar store at Main and East Amherst streets that a group of residents, as well as a prominent Buffalo developer, didn’t want in the neighborhood.

The Zoning Board of Appeals voted, 3-1, against the discount store that Hutchinson Commercial Real Estate Services of Williamsport, Pa., proposed building at 2675 Main St., site of the now-vacant former Eckerd drugstore building.

“The overwhelming response to the community – so many were against it,” the Rev. James Lewis, board chairman, said in explaining why he voted against the plan.

Board member Anthony Diina, the only vote in favor, said he supported the project, given the unusual shape of the lot and the failure of the existing zoning for the property. He referred to disparaging comments made by opponents of the store as “outrageous” and also was critical of those who criticized a community organization that supported the project.

“It’s clear the Zoning Board of Appeals capitulated to community opposition of a vocal minority,” said attorney Corey A. Auerbach, representing Family Dollar.

The board was being asked to approve zoning variances addressing issues including signage, parking, building size and front and side yard placement. Auerbach argued that any new construction on the irregularly shaped site would face similar zoning issues.

Opposition to the Family Dollar plan, nonetheless, was strong and vocal.

Some 18 people lined up in the boardroom Wednesday to speak against the plan. Among them were John A. Ciminelli, of LPCiminelli, whose company is in the process of redeveloping the nearby Central Park Plaza into a $70 million apartment complex.

“It doesn’t fit here,” Ciminelli said of the store, arguing that it goes against the city’s efforts to promote a Green Code and transit-friendly development. “You don’t want to walk out of the subway station and see this,” he said.

Assemblywoman Crystal D. Peoples-Stokes, D-Buffalo, also spoke against the proposal.

“I represent both sides of Main Street,” the assemblywoman told the board. “What is proposed is not something people want.”

“Masten constituents do not want this,” Common Council Member Ulysees O. Wingo of the Masten District.

Amber Small, executive director of Parkside Community Association, also opposed the plan. The zoning changes requested are severe, she said.

Melissa Brown, of FLARE Community Center on nearby Leroy Avenue, said that the group distributed surveys and that only 46 people opposed the project. About 3,000 residents live in the immediate area, she said. She didn’t have the surveys with her, but offered to provide them in the future. Wednesday, however, was the last of several Zoning Board meetings on the issue.

Previously, FLARE had been accused of supporting the project only after the developer offered a $100,000 donation. FLARE denied the accusation.

3694,"As the Inn on the Square's two-month renovation nears completion, part of the building's history wants to stay present. 
 
Claire Griffith, Inn on the Square events manager, said the Inn has four ghosts: one named Bill who lives in the bar and a grandmother, mother and small child who live on the third floor. They have made their presence known. 
 
""I swear he (Bill) has stolen files from me,"" Griffith said. ""I know he has."" 
 
The staff also blames Bill for a water leak from the second floor ice machine that caused damage to the ceiling on the first floor. 
 
""We never turned any ice machines on,"" Griffith said. ""I don't think they were ever plugged in. We just give Bill the credit for it."" 
 
Because Bill does not like to be closed in the bar at night, Griffith said the staff has to tell him when it is time to leave each night. 
 
""Apparently, stories have it that if you do shut him in and don't tell him that it's time to go, he'll rattle the doors, so the front desk people are freaking out at night,"" she said. 
 
With the Inn's grand opening scheduled for 5 p.m. Oct. 1 with soft openings at Greenwood Area Chamber's Super Networking Night Thursday and test runs with invited community members Friday and Saturday, the Inn is keeping its historical flair with modern conveniences. 
 
For example, the Inn's bar will be called ""The Fox and Hound"" to retain the nostalgia of the Inn and old Greenwood. 
 
""Even though it is very, very different, we wanted to keep a little bit of the past and represent that history,"" Griffith said. 
 
The dining room will also open Oct. 1, and the kitchen renovations are finished. With the carpet laid, Griffith said the finishing touches and staff training are the final parts of the renovation -- even though the project may currently look incomplete. 
 
""We are moving ahead right along with schedule,"" she said. ""Even though it looks like this today, I know by next Thursday it will be perfect."" 
 
Griffith said the third floor will open about two weeks after the rest of the hotel. 
 
With an emphasis on local, Griffith, who lives in Greenwood, said all staff members who are Griffith's ""dream team"" are connected to Greenwood in one way or another. 
 
""I think we have the best of what Greenwood has to offer,"" Griffith said. ""Whatever it takes, they're doing it."" 
 
Griffith said the Inn is already booked for next year's Festival of Discovery, Masters Golf Tournament in Augusta and the LPGA Symetra Tour golf tournament. She said wedding parties have also booked the hotel for events and rooms, and their catering division is almost booked for Christmas parties. 
 
""It's been exciting,"" Griffith said. ""It's been slightly overwhelming somedays, but I definitely think we are looking forward to pulling through. There's always a way to make it happen.""",4784361f-2e6b-4031-a20b-bdd38471ba7d,News,2015-09-24T20:21:28Z,Index Journal,"Past, present coming together at the Inn on the Square",0.0,News
4040,"NEW YORK, Sept. 5, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer LLP (www.kaplanfox.com) and Wites & Kapetan, P.A. (http://www.wklawyers.com) have filed a class action suit against Investment Technology Group, Inc. (""ITG"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: ITG), and certain of its executives, that alleges violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of purchasers of ITG common stock during the period February 28, 2011 through August 3, 2015, inclusive (the ""Class""). 

The case is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. A copy of the Complaint may be obtained from Kaplan Fox's website, or from the Court. The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements to investors concerning the Company's POSIT network, an Alternative Trading System or ""dark pool."" The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, ITG held itself out as an ""agency-only"" and ""conflict-free"" broker, and represented that POSIT safeguarded client trading data, but omitted to disclose: ""(1) that, as detailed in the SEC Settlement Order, between April 2010 through July 2011, the Company operated a proprietary trading pilot called 'Project Omega' within the Company's AlterNet subsidiary that involved 'crossing against sell-side clients in POSIT' and violations of the Company's policies and procedures by Mittal, a former ITG Managing Director, Head of Algorithmic Trading, and Head of Liquidity Management; (2) that Mittal, while head of Project Omega, along with numerous other employees, accessed private client data within the Company while simultaneously operating a proprietary trading strategy, a clear conflict of interest; (3) that this conduct violated Regulation ATS; and (4) that the Company was under investigation for this conduct by the SEC by Fall 2013, and faced an enforcement action by May 2015, which threatened major fines and legal costs as well as reputational harm to the Company and loss of customers.""

The Complaint further alleges that on July 29, 2015, after the market closed, ""ITG issued a press release disclosing, for the first time, the underlying wrongful conduct and the SEC's investigation thereof (the 'July 29 Press Release'),"" and that ""ITG expected to pay an aggregate amount of approximately $20.3 million, including an $18 million civil penalty, disgorgement of $2.1 million in improperly gotten trading revenues, and about $250,000 in prejudgment interest,"" pursuant to the settlement. On July 30, 2015, ITG's stock price declined approximately 23.5%, or $5.64 per share, to close at $18.36 per share.The Complaint further alleges that on August 3, 2015, before the market opened, ""the Company announced that it was replacing Gasser as CEO, as well as its general counsel, Mats Goebels"" and that ""[t]he Wall Street Journal reported that day that the departures were related to Gasser's failure to disclose certain details of the improper conduct relating to POSIT to the Board."" On August 3, 2015, ITG's share price declined by approximately 4%, or $0.84 per share, to close at $19.51 per share.The Complaint further alleges that on August 4, 2015, before the market opened, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, Defendant Steven R. Vigliotti disclosed that ""[i]n the three trading days since we announced the potential SEC settlement… in the U.S. our volume market share was down about 25%."" On August 4, 2015, ITG's share price fell approximately 5.28%, or $1.03 per share, to close at $18.48 per share.The Complaint further alleges that on August 12, 2015, the SEC announced its settlement with ITG, and released an Order that included ""detailed admissions of wrongdoing"" by ITG, and imposed ""a civil penalty in the amount of $18,000,000 – the largest civil penalty to date assessed by the SEC against an Alternative Trading System"" – in addition to over $2 million in disgorgement of wrongfully-gotten revenues and pre-judgment interest of over $250,000. 

On August 24, 2015, Reuters reported that volume in ITG's dark pool had dropped by ""nearly half in the week-and-a-half after the brokerage disclosed it was near a record settlement with regulators over violations in its so-called 'dark pool,'….Volume in the dark pool dropped 17.9 percent the week of July 27, and fell another 32.8 percent by the end of the following week, for a total of 44.9 percent, according to data released on Monday by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.""

If you are a member of the proposed Class, you may move the court no later than October 5, 2015 to serve as a lead plaintiff for the Class. You need not seek to become a lead plaintiff in order to share in any possible recovery.

1336,"Elyria authorities are looking for four suspects who invaded a 61-year-old woman’s home, held her at gunpoint, shot her dog and claimed to be the Elyria police. 
  
At about 3 a.m. Sept. 9, officers were dispatched to the 700 block of 18th Street on a report of a robbery, Elyria police Capt. Chris Costantino said. 
  
The woman told police that she went to bed around midnight and woke up three hours later to a large crash at her front door. Costantino said her white pit bull ran toward the front door. He said she then heard another loud sound. 
  
The woman walked down her hallway and was approached by a black male wearing a black sweatshirt, with the hood over his head and a mask covering his face, Costantino said. The man placed a gun to her forehead and ordered her to the ground, he said. 
 
 
  
Three others were with the man and she could hear them saying that they were the Elyria police and to get down, he said. 
  
The woman looked at their clothing and realized they were not police officers, Costantino said. Three of the four culprits were armed, he said. 
  
The suspects asked the woman where the money was, but she didn’t know what they were talking about, according to Costantino. After searching the house, one of the individuals indicated he found some money and told her not to call the police or she would be hurt, Costantino said. 
  
At some point during the incident, he said, the dog was shot and taken for emergency medical treatment. The dog survived, Costantino said. 
  
Police are investigating the incident. Anyone with information on the suspects is encouraged to call the Elyria Police Department at 440-323-33",e9a5e99c-cc4c-47bb-a328-32ddedc7c70a,News,2015-09-10T19:37:58Z,Lorain Morning Journal,"Elyria police say four suspects invaded home, shot dog",0.0,Blog

4709,"Chicago | Reuters – – U.S. soybean futures fell on Friday and were down about 0.8 per cent for the week as farmers prepared to harvest a bumper crop in the Midwest, traders said. 
 
Corn followed soybeans lower while wheat futures firmed on short covering, despite ample global supplies. 
 
At the Chicago Board of Trade, November soybeans settled down 17-1/4 cents at $8.67-1/4 per bushel after hitting $8.66-1/2, a one-week low (all figures US$). 
 
December corn ended down 2-1/2 cents at $3.77-1/4 a bushel and December wheat rose 5-1/4 cents to $4.86-3/4 a bushel. 
 
Soybeans slid on expectations that farmers will soon begin harvesting what is projected as the second-largest U.S. soy crop in history. Harvest is under way in the mid-South and a few parts of the Midwest, including top states Illinois and Iowa, brokers said. 
 
“The yield reports that have been coming through on beans (are) generally looking better than they have on corn,” said Rich Feltes, vice president for research with R.J. O’Brien. 
 
Forecasts called for mostly dry weather next week and for the rest of the month, with no frost, Feltes noted, which should help crops to mature and promote fieldwork. 
 
Cash soybean values have been falling in the Midwest this week as processors brace for the influx of new-crop supplies. 
 
Also bearish were early prospects for record-large crops out of South America, where farmers are planting. Brazilian analyst Safras + Mercado raised its forecast for the country’s 2015-16 soybean crop to a record 100.54 million tonnes, from 99.3 million in July. 
 
“Most of the big-picture stuff is pretty negative,” said Joe Vaclavik, president of Standard Grain, Chicago brokerage. 
 
Corn followed soybeans lower on seasonal U.S. harvest pressure and sluggish export demand. 
 
Wheat futures climbed on what appeared to be fund short covering. Commodity funds hold a net short position in CBOT wheat, leaving the market open to short-covering rallies. But ample world wheat supplies hang over the market. 
 
Underscoring strong competition for exports, a wheat tender from Egypt’s General Authority for Supply Commodities attracted offers of about 945,000 tonnes from the Black Sea region and France. No U.S. wheat was offered. 
 
Egypt bought a total of 230,000 tonnes of Ukrainian, Russian and French wheat.

1765,"After four days of intense competition, the Army has named its 2015 Drill Sergeants and AIT Platoon Sergeant of the Year. Staff Sgt. Jacob Miller of Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, is this year's Drill Sergeant of the Year. Staff Sgt. Mark Mercer is the Army Reserve Drill Sergeant of the Year. Mercer is assigned to the 95th Division, 108th Training Command. This year's Advanced Individual Training Platoon Sergeant of the Year is Sgt. 1st Class Samuel Enriquez of Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, Texas. All three soldiers were recognized Thursday evening at an awards ceremony at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. Each received the Meritorious Service Medal. The Drill Sergeant and AIT Platoon Sergeant of the Year event is a four-day, ""best-of-the-best"" contest that puts competitors through physical and mental tests, according to information from the Army. Competitors must battle fatigue, weather and surprise events to earn the coveted titles. They must perform and instruct more than 50 tasks and drills including unknown distance runs and foot marches, rappelling, orienteering, obstacle courses, physical readiness training and appearances before a board of command sergeants major to demonstrate their knowledge of leadership and training tasks. While the Drill Sergeant and AIT Platoon Sergeant competition is similar to other competitions across the Army, this event focuses on competitors' ability to teach, as their day-to-day job requires them to effectively teach the Army's newest soldiers. This year, four active-duty and two Army Reserve drill sergeants competed for the Drill Sergeant of the Year title. Eight AIT platoon sergeants competed this year. All were competition winners at their respective installations or Army Reserve divisions. A closer look at this year's winners: •  Staff Sgt. Jacob Miller As Drill Sergeant of the Year, Miller will be moving to Fort Eustis, Virginia, where he will work at the Center for Initial Military Training. There, he’ll have a chance to provide input and help shape the way the Army trains new soldiers. Miller, 30, joined the Army in November 2006. He completed military police one station unit training at Fort Leonard Wood in April 2007 and has served in MP units at Fort Carson, Colorado, Fort Wainwright, Alaska, and Fort Leonard Wood. Miller, who is working on his bachelor’s degree in criminal justice, has deployed twice to Iraq. His awards and decorations include an Army Commendation Medal with Valor, the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, the Iraq Campaign Medal, and the Combat Action Badge. Miller, who has been a drill sergeant since March 2013, was in disbelief that he won. “It’s unreal,” he said. ‘It was definitely a long competition, a long week of hard, intense training.” Page 2 of 3 - To prepare for the competition, Miller trained hard, including lots of foot marches, long-distance running and sprints. He also studied up on Army drill and ceremony and all the other tasks soldiers must know. “This competition was very intensive,” Miller said. “Everybody that came here were all winners. Going up against the top of the top here was just unreal.” At the same time, the soldiers shared a common camaraderie, Miller said. “We all came together, we helped each other out, pushed each other,” he said. His advice for those looking ahead to next year’s competition: “Prepare for anything. You need to be fully well rounded when you come here.” •  Staff Sgt. Mark Mercer Mercer joined the Army in July 2002, training as an X-ray technologist. He has served primarily in Oklahoma and has deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Mercer is a graduate of the University of Oklahoma, with a degree in administrative leadership. His awards and decorations include the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, and the Afghanistan Campaign Medal. The 31-year-old said he was “relieved, excited” when he learned he had won. “Just so many emotions wrapped up in my body right now,” he said. “I don’t know if I’m in shock still or what’s going on. It shows that hard work pays off.” Mercer started training for the competition in October. In addition to the physical training, Mercer spent three hours every night studying every Army regulation, field manual and publication he could find. “My wife’s glad this is over because we can spend time together now,” he said. “It was very long, strenuous, and I may have trained too hard physically in the end, but I got where I needed to be. Determination and adrenaline go a long way.” Mercer said he’s glad for the experience. “I’ve made some good friends here, met a lot of great people, a lot of knowledgeable people,” he said. “It was an honor to compete against and alongside every single person that was here this week.” • Sgt. 1st Class Samuel Enriquez Enriquez, 30, is a combat medic who joined the Army in August 2002. Before his assignment as an AIT platoon sergeant at Fort Sam Houston, Enriquez served multiple tours with the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and has served in Germany and South Korea. His awards and decorations include the Meritorious Service Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Expert Field Medical Badge, the Senior Parachutist Badge and the Air Assault Badge. Page 3 of 3 - Winning the competition “still seems surreal,” he said. “I’m still soaking it in.” Enriquez, who has been an AIT platoon sergeant since January, also will be moving to the Center for Initial Military Training. “I’m part of something bigger now,” he said. “I’m part of a different level of the Army where I can make huge changes. Before, I loved it, and I could always make change, but it was more incremental. Here I can help make gigantic changes that could shape the future of the Army.” In his new assignment, Enriquez will be responsible for providing input that will shape the initial entry process, whether it’s basic training or AIT. “It’s a pretty grand thing, just thinking about the fact that you’re changing the way the Army trains its soldiers,” he said. “I never thought I’d be in this position.”",e7ea7dd7-0266-431a-bfb4-c8e88532c0d4,News,2015-09-12T16:38:05Z,Waynesville Daily Guide,"Drill Sergeant, AIT Platoon Sergeant of the Year named 10:44 am",0.0,Blog

1031,"I took the Man to his event this morning, which was a grueling miles-long loaded-rucksack hike with other vets. I really like the fact that he does stuff like this--challenges himself, stays fit, gets with his tribe, recharges himself in that way. I dropped him off and awaited him at the end hours later, armed with a sandwich and a lot of cold beer. He was exhausted and happy, that place you get into when you've done something that really challenges you and completed it, brought out the best of yourself. I could tell he was in a pretty deep space so I suggested that he go home and rest and let himself soak in the experience tonight. 
On the way to drop him at his car, he informed me--in that funny way he does--that he'd had a lot of time to think on the hike, and presented me with a multilayered theory of what's going on with my life, how I haven't retained a boyfriend because I'm type A and they get freaked out (? I'm not sure if I remember correctly that that's what he said. In my own opinion, I just tend to wander away from guys who aren't nice, since I don't tend to volunteer a lot of information about myself in dating and it would therefore not usually be known that I have so many things going on unless you've known me for quite a while. I tell him things, but that's because he asks.) He also presented some thoughts and theories about my business, as well as letting me know that he's worried I don't sleep or eat enough. 
I was genuinely touched, surprised and amused, as I would think that on a miles long loaded rucksack hike, you'd mostly be thinking about how to get up the next hill, or where the next bathroom was, stuff like that. But, he is like that, he operates on multiple tracks. Perhaps contemplating the eccentricities of my life got his mind off the pain, eh? I have to admit that I didn't really manage to take it all in, as I was captaining a short drive in dinner hour traffic and the theory he presented was baklava-like in its complexity. I'm sure I'll hear more about it if he thinks about it some more and wants to continue. 
Then I went and had dinner with part of my adoptive family, the Flynn sisters; so good to see them and I'm giving the younger a Feldenkrais lesson tomorrow, something I used to do regularly as part of caring for three generations of their family. I've been invited to Albuquerque for a Flynn Christmas, and I'm thinking about doing it; somehow that 10 or 12 hour drive through northwest Texas is one of the magical spaces that seems to open up time. The last time I did it--to visit the Flynn brother and his wife, actually--I remember stopping at a big field full of tumbleweeds blown high against blackened wire fencing, just standing there for a long time, touching the thorny balls with my fingers, looking out over the amber and grey North Texas plains, traffic whizzing by on the road at my back. 
I always remember the way the long trains stretch into the curve of the desert for miles, the way it feels to drive alongside them into what feels like eternity; the lonely vastness of magical New Mexico space, earth meeting sky. It's a long drive, one through strange and haunting country; one I've done many times, but not in a while. It feels like I disappear out there, into some kind of ether between realms. 
So that was today, the Man conquering with his tribe, me the puzzled alphette, family time, thoughts of the road. ",82c0c1d4-45b1-4861-b880-c414de299948,Blog,2015-09-27T04:37:00Z,Flying Into the Light,"Puzzled Alphette, Family Time",1.0,News
5172,"VALDOSTA, GA (WALB) - 

Habitat For Humanity volunteers in Valdosta are breaking out their paint brushes to help some citizens as part of national ""A Brush With Kindness"" week.

Wednesday, Shirley Morrison's home was getting a fresh coat of paint. ""I've been looking forward to it for awhile,"" Morrison said. 

Volunteers from VSU and throughout the city are coming together this week to help Habitat For Humanity paint several houses across the city.

""It feels very good,"" said VSU student Celena White, as she painted Morrison's house. ""They might not be fortunate enough to go out themselves and buy the paint, so why not help out with them?""

""To make a difference,"" said Al Torker as he climbed up a ladder on the back of Morrison's home, preparing to paint the trim along the roof line.

Torker was helping paint the house in hopes of encouraging others to to help out in their communities as well.

""To whom much is given, much is required,"" Torker emphasized. ""If you can help someone, you need to. Life is short and if you want to make a difference in life you got to do it then and now. Even the little smallest things can make a difference.""

Morrison said she feels blessed to have members in her community with that attitude. ""I feel like that's a blessing. For them to come out and help me, that shows that people have love for you and care,"" said Morrison.

That's the goal. Spreading paint on the house, and kindness in the community. Through Saturday, volunteers will work on three more homes in the city.",85b38032-24dc-4db1-9630-42f8c561ef58,News,2015-09-23T16:23:00Z,WFXG FOX 54,Valdosta Habitat For Humanity spreading kindness by spreading paint,0.0,Blog

WASHINGTON, Sept 4 (Reuters) – The U.S. economy likely added 
jobs at a steady pace in August and the unemployment rate 
probably fell to a near 7-1/2-year low of 5.2 percent, which 
could allow a cautious Federal Reserve to consider a September 
interest rate hike. 
 
A Reuters survey of economists forecast nonfarm payrolls 
increased by 220,000 last month, up from 215,000 new jobs in 
July. 
 
That would underscore the economy’s vibrancy in the face of 
volatile global financial markets and China’s slowing growth, 
and keep alive the prospect of the Fed raising benchmark 
overnight rates at its next policy meeting, on Sept. 16-17. 
 
“We don’t think it will detract from the possibility that 
the Fed is considering a September rate hike, only if we saw 
ominous signs of a deterioration elsewhere in the data,” said 
Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in 
Charlotte, North Carolina. 
 
The Labor Department will release its closely watched 
employment report on Friday at 8:30 a.m. EDT (1230 GMT). 
 
In the wake of the recent global equities selloff, financial 
markets significantly scaled back bets on a rate hike over the 
past month. But Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer told CNBC last 
week it was too early to decide whether the stock market rout 
had made a September rate increase less compelling. 
 
Economists acknowledge a risk that job gains could come in 
below expectations as the first reading of August payrolls has 
tended to be weaker in the last several years before being 
revised higher. 
 
They say the model the government uses to smooth the data 
for seasonal fluctuations often does not fully capture 
statistical noise from the start of a new school year. In 
addition, the response rate from employers to the government’s 
job survey tends to be low in August. 
 
According to Goldman Sachs, preliminary August payroll 
numbers have undershot expectations by an average of 30,000 
since 2010, while subsequent revisions have averaged 79,000 over 
the past five years. 
 
 
ECONOMIC MOMENTUM 
 
“Despite the stock market volatility this month and the 
growing cracks in China’s economy … we don’t see any signs of 
slowing in the labor market yet,” said Andrew Chamberlain, chief 
economist at Glassdoor in San Francisco. 
 
Sturdy payroll gains would add to a string of upbeat data, 
including figures on automobile sales and housing, that has 
suggested the economy was moving ahead with strong momentum 
early in the third quarter after growing at a robust 3.7 percent 
annual rate in the April-through-June period. 
 
If the jobless rate falls one-tenth of a percentage point as 
expected that would take it to its lowest level since April 2008 
and bring it into the range that most Fed officials think is 
consistent with a low but steady rate of inflation. 
 
Jobs gains were likely spread across nearly all sectors of 
the economy in August. The energy sector, which is still 
grappling with last year’s sharp drop in crude oil prices, is 
expected to be the exception. 
 
Robust demand for autos is seen boosting manufacturing 
employment, while solid gains are forecast for construction 
payrolls as housing gains muscle. 
 
Average hourly earnings are expected to have risen 0.2 
percent – the same as in July. That would leave them around 2.2 
percent above their year-ago level, still well below the 3.5 
percent growth rate economists consider healthy. 
 
Some analysts think earnings are being held back by falling 
wages in oil field services. 
 
But a tightening labor market and decisions by several state 
and local governments to raise the minimum wage should 
eventually translate into faster earnings growth and give the 
Fed confidence that inflation, which collapsed with oil prices, 
will move closer to its 2 percent target. 
 
A number of retailers, including Walmart, Target 
and TJX Cos, have increased pay for hourly 
workers.

1350,"Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes gestures as he stands on the podium after winning the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka. 
             
Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton pulled off an aggressive passing move on teammate Nico Rosberg and went on to win the Japanese Grand Prix on Sunday, moving a step closer to claiming his second straight Formula One title. 
 
Hamilton, who had his first retirement of the season at last weekend's Singapore GP, capitalised on a strong start and surged ahead of Rosberg at the first corner. He led the rest of the way, crossing the finish line a comfortable 18.9 seconds ahead. Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel was third, 1.8 seconds behind Rosberg, who started from pole. 
 
With five races left, Hamilton has a 48-point lead over Rosberg. 
 
Hamilton claimed his eighth win of the season. It was his 41st career win, tying him with his childhood hero Ayrton Senna. 
 
""I'm not a teary guy, but I'm full of joy and happiness today,"" Hamilton said. 
 
Rosberg and Hamilton went through the first two bends side by side. Hamilton appeared to give Rosberg little room at the second turn, forcing the German partially off the track. 
 
""I didn't think it was that close,"" Hamilton said. ""The inside line is the inside line, so it was my corner."" 
 
Rosberg was reserving judgment until he saw the incident on replay. 
 
""It was a pity to do that on the start,"" Rosberg said. ""We battled around Turns 1 and 2. It got very close on the exit at Turn 2 and I had to back out and that cost me the race."" 
 
With Hamilton comfortably ahead throughout the grand prix, the focus shifted to the tight battle for second place between Rosberg and Vettel. 
 
Ferrari elected to wait until Rosberg pitted before bringing in Vettel, and that proved critical. Even though Vettel's stop was four tenths of a second faster than Rosberg's, the Mercedes driver's lap on fresh rubber was enough to get him just ahead of Vettel, and that's how it stayed. 
 
""I tried everything,"" Vettel said. ""The tyres were on the limit - not more that I could have done."" 
 
Vettel's Ferrari teammate Kimi Raikkonen was fourth followed by Williams' Valtteri Bottas. 
 
The podium positions were exactly the same as last year's race at Suzuka which was marred by a crash involving Jules Bianchi, who died in July, having never regained consciousness. 
 
""This is a circuit that I can honestly say I've struggled at through all the years I've come here,"" Hamilton said. ""But it's one that I've loved driving at...so you really want to come here and dominate at this track."" 
 
Force India's Niko Hulkenberg was sixth while the Lotus pair of Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado finished seventh and eighth, giving the financially strapped team a confidence boost. 
 
Toro Rosso's Max Verstappen - in his last race as a 17-year-old - was ninth ahead of his teammate Carlos Sainz Jr. 
 
Both Red Bull cars finished outside the top 10. Daniil Kvyat started from the pits, while Daniel Ricciardo had a tire-bumping duel with Williams' Felipe Massa soon after the start, leaving both with punctures that forced them to pit after one lap.

Across six countries, the public thought more than half of workers pulled a sickie in the past year, but less than 25% said they had, Ipsos Mori found 

Feigning illness to take a day off work is much less common than people think, according to the results of an international survey that suggests the public overestimates undesirable behaviour in others. 

Averaging the results from the six countries polled by Ipsos Mori (the UK, US, Canada, Australia, France and Germany), the average guess was that 52% of workers in their nation have pulled a sickie in the past year, but only 23% admitted to having done so themselves. 

People in the UK believe that half of the population have unjustifiably called in sick at least once in the past year, when just one in five say they did so. In fact, the average number of sick days (legitimate and illegitimate) taken has generally been in decline for a number of years. 

The gap is biggest in France, where the consensus is that 40% have pretended to be ill to get a day off work, compared to the 6% that say they actually have. 

Ipsos Mori also found other types of undesirable behaviour that are not as prevalent as commonly thought include eating too much sugar, not exercising enough and, in Britain at least, people not saving enough for their retirement. 

The average guess by Britons for the proportion of the population that eat more than the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) daily limit of sugar (50g) is 69%, while a separate survey by Public Health England shows it is actually 47%. Ipsos Mori calculated this figure from the report’s data tables. 

Across the six countries, the average guess was that 66% were eating more than 50g a day. However, only 40% thought they were exceeding the limit themselves. 

However, people in every country underestimated how much exercise the wider population and, by implication, they themselves were probably doing each week. 

For example, in Germany just 39% of those surveyed thought they were reaching the exercise target of walking briskly for at least 30 minutes, five times a week, or doing more vigorous exercises for 20 minutes, three times a week. When asked how many people out of 100 in Germany were meeting this target, the average guess was 37%, but according to a 2",5e207d24-9b83-404c-8d3f-e54bba29d029,News,2015-09-02T12:53:57Z,MyInforms,"In good company?

4348,"Some weekend Central Asia reads: The manhunt for Tajikistan’s former deputy defense minister, Abduhalim Nazarzoda, is on. After the September 4 events that authorities report resulted in the deaths of nine police officers and 17 “terrorists,” the state formally charged Nazarzoda with “high treason, terrorism, sabotage, and creating an extremist group.” The authorities said on September 5 that the renegade general had fled to Romit Gorge, with seven to eight supporters. The numbers were arbitrary. The following days were filled with claims by the Tajik government to have arrested 17 members of Nazarzoda’s group “as a result of special operations” in Romit Gorge. As Asia-Plus reports, “According to official data, security forces have killed 22 members of Nazarzoda group and arrested more than 100 others, since the operation against the group was launched.” While the manhunt continues, read up on Nazarzoda to get a better picture of who the general is and what led up to the events of September 4. First check out Eurasianet’s profile of Nazarzoda. Then read Farangis Najibullah’s profile for RFE/RL, which goes deeper into explaining how Nazarzoda navigated the civil war and fit himself into the post-war peace arrangements. While Tajikistan’s September 9 Independence Day was marred by the ongoing manhunt, a different celebration in neighboring Uzbekistan also proceeded under significant gloom. The recently-fired director of the Nukus Art Museum which houses Igor Savitsky’s prized collection of banned Soviet art, Marinika Babanazarova, was absent from the museum’s centenary celebration of Savitsky’s birth. Agnieszka Pikulicka-Wilczewska wrote about the celebration for Eurasianet, noting that the the rainy day “felt like an omen.” In another art-related story in Uzbekistan, the European magazine Cafebabel interviewed Umida Akhmedova, an Uzbek photojournalist and documentary filmmaker who was convicted in 2010 of “defamation” and “insult” related to a documentary she had made with her husband about rural life in Uzbekistan. The government said they “had discredited and disrespected the traditions and values ​​of the Uzbek people.” While Akhmedova was quickly released, life remains difficult for her as an artist in the country. As Kyrgyzstan enters the month-long campaign season leading up to the October 4 parliamentary election, IWPR’s Timur Toktonaliev interviewed Tamerlan Ibraimov, director of the Center for Political and Legal Studies in Kyrgyzstan, about the development and evolution of rule of law in the country. While the Kyrgyz constitution enshrines the rule of law, Toktonaliev asks if that is really the case. In response, Ibraimov says right now the reality is that “ the law works in some cases, while elsewhere it is other things that prevail. Take what’s called ‘telephone law’ – when matters are resolved by a phone call from above. Or corruption, where what counts is who pays the most.” The interview dives into the erosion of the rule of law prior to Kyrgyzstan’s independence from the Soviet Union as well as the increasing role of religion in providing “answers to both spiritual and political questions.” Also a month away are Kazakhstan’s celebrations in Taraz of the 550th anniversary of the Kazakh Khanate. This weekend Astana is hosting a celebration of its own, part of an ongoing geopolitical and nationalistic statement. In August 2014, Putin responded to a question regarding Russian concern about nationalism in Ukraine and rising nationalism in Kazakhstan by saying that Nazarbayev had “created a state on a territory where there had never been a state. The Kazakhs had never had statehood. He founded it.” Nate Schenkkan translated the entire exchange and provided insightful commentary last year on Registan, writing that “this is an extraordinary event. I don’t know how the Kazakh government will respond to this, but assuredly there are people in Astana in very high places who are both scared and furious.”",a14e0c13-564e-485c-a273-6cbd742402c3,Blog,2015-09-11T16:13:18Z,The Diplomat,Current Events Overshadow Anniversaries in Central Asia,1.0,News

6193,"(CNN) -  
Pope Francis on Wednesday canonized Junipero Serra, a Spanish missionary, a moment of deep pride for Latinos but a source of controversy for many Native Americans. 
 
Serra, who came to California nearly 250 years ago, is the first saint to be canonized on U.S. soil. 

""Junipero Serra left his native land and its way of life,"" Francis said in his homily during the canonization Mass at Catholic University in Washington. ""He was excited about blazing trails, going forth to meet many people, learning and valuing their particular customs and ways of life."" 

The Pope praised Serra's treatment of Native Americans, saying that he ""sought to defend the dignity of the native community, to protect it from those who had mistreated and abused it."" 

""Mistreatment and wrongs which today still trouble us,"" Francis continued, ""especially because of the hurt which they cause in the lives of many people."" 

The Pope has planned to meet with Native Americans in Washington after the Mass, a Vatican official told CNN's Delia Gallagher. 

But some Native Americans say Serra was no saint. 

""We're stunned and we're in disbelief,"" said Valentin Lopez, 63, chairman of the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band located along Monterey Bay in California. 

""We believe saints are supposed to be people who followed in the life of Jesus Christ and the words of Jesus Christ. There was no Jesus Christ lifestyle at the missions,"" Lopez said, who has campaigned against sainthood for Serra. 

Archbishop Jose Gomez of Los Angeles, though, called the canonization of Serra ""the most important dimension of the Pope's visit"" to the United States, which lasts through Sunday. 

""This is the big story: The first Hispanic Pope is coming to America to give us our first Hispanic saint. This is not a coincidence,"" Gomez said at a news conference last month. 

The Rev. Timothy Kesicki, president of the Jesuit Conference in Washington, said many scholars acknowledge Serra's complicated legacy. 

""But I don't think Pope Francis wants pristine saints,"" Kesicki continued, ""because then no one will aspire to sainthood."" 

Fifty different tribes in California condemned the sainthood conferred on Serra, said Deborah Miranda, a literature professor at Washington and Lee University in Virginia and a member of the Ohlone Costanoan Esselen Nation of California. She wrote ""Bad Indians: A Tribal Memoir,"" a book about her ancestors' experiences in the Spanish missions. 

""My objection and the objection of many California Indians is that he is being honored for in fact dishonoring many of our California ancestors. The missions ended up killing about 90% of the California Indians present at the time of missionization, creating all kinds of cultural and emotional baggage that we still carry to this day,"" Miranda said. ""It's not a question of attacking the Catholic Church or attacking Pope Francis. It's about making sure that the truth is heard and that injustices are not continued on into the 21st century."" 

But the Native American campaign to stop Serra's canonization never gained an audience in Rome, Miranda said. 

""We have gotten zero response from the Vatican, not a word. We do not exist, it seems, in Pope Francis' world,"" Miranda said. ""They're interested in his record and in how many people he managed to convert and in the fact that he at this point in time is a famous Spanish person when the church really needs some positive PR, so they are purposely overlooking the deaths and the cultural genocide of Native American people because it's to their benefit."" 

Ahead of the Mass on Wednesday, thousands lined up for hours in nightmarish lines snaking around parts of the Catholic University of America campus. 

The queues stretched to security checkpoints where those holding the 25,000 tickets distributed for the ceremony. Federal law enforcement agencies conducting the searches included the Transportation Security Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. 

By the time Francis arrived on campus, hordes of people were still waiting to clear checkpoints. 

Wednesday was the Pope's first full day in the United States, a trip that will also take him to New York and Philadelphia.",67f536e0-8d97-48ce-8f6a-3e9a16a8c4eb,News,2015-09-23T23:24:55Z,KRDO.com,"New saint divides Latinos, Native Americans",0.0,News

Coastal habitats full of vegetation, including seagrass beds, salt marshes and mangroves, are some of the best absorbers of atmospheric carbon dioxide, according to FIU marine scientists Mike Heithaus 

Many of the world's oceans are experiencing significant declines in predator populations due, in large part, to overfishing. Without adequate numbers of predators, grazers, such as turtles, are left to roam and devour vegetation freely, also disturbing sediments and soils. This is of particular concern considering that sediments are excellent at storing carbon.

""People typically think of predators and people as being in conflict,"" said Heithaus, who also serves as the dean of FIU's College of Arts & Sciences. ""But the presence of marine predators is good for us in many ways. They help to preserve ecosystems that support human uses like fisheries. And the evidence continues to stack up that their contributions to the long-term stability of these ecosystems can help mitigate climate change through preserving carbon stores.""

In the past 50 years, land-use changes, climate change and other factors have resulted in the loss of as much as 50 percent of the world's vegetated coastal habitats. The effects can be seen throughout the world. In Cape Cod, Mass. 

""Scientists and policy makers around the world are just beginning to understand the importance of carbon stored in coastal vegetated habitats to climate policy,"" said Fourqurean, an international advocate for the Blue Carbon initiative - storage of carbon in seagrasses and other coastal habitats. ""This new study highlights how fisheries practices have a surprising and strong impact of the stability of the coastal carbon stores. In effect, fishing activities can influence the rate of global climate change.""

561,"Five PMs since 2010  
Here we go again. My my. Another leader. Rocco Fazzari and Denis Carnahan with apologies to ABBA. 
 PT1M14S   620  349    
Every Prime Minister arrives with a history of disputes with other powerful figures, and Malcolm Turnbull has more than his fair share. Here's his top five: 

1.  Rupert Murdoch 
 
PM Malcolm Turnbull wants to scrap the archaic Knights and Dames system. Photo: Rob Homer  
  
Rupert Murdoch media mogul and prolific tweeter, has made no secret that he preferred Tony Abbott as leader of the Liberal Party. Murdoch's tabloids made no secret of it either. ""Malcolm Turncoat,"" said the Herald Sun , ""Smiling Assassin,"" said the Daily Telegraph after the party room spill. 
 
But the problems between Turnbull and Murdoch run deeper than a preference for Abbott's conservatism. As communications minister, Turnbull proposed an overhaul of the media ownership laws that would have permitted media companies to extend their geographic reach beyond 75 per cent and move into radio, television and newspapers. (They are currently restricted to two.) News Corp Australia opposed the changes because it does not include changes to the anti-siphoning rules, which are designed to keep important sporting programs on free-to-air television. This rule crimps the Murdoch and Telstra-owned pay TV service, Foxtel, which would no doubt use exclusive sport to lift subscriptions. 

Abbott parked Turnbull's media reforms and they have not seen the light of day. Will Turnbull now elevate them to a reform priority?

2. Alan Jones – radio broadcaster 

Backtrack to June 5 last year when broadcaster Alan Jones lectured and harangued Turnbull over his loyalty on air. It was electrifying radio. It opened with Jones insisting Turnbull repeat an affirmation of loyalty to Abbott and went downhill from there. 

Jones: ""You have no hope ever of being the leader. You've got to get that into your head. No hope ever. But because of that you're happy to throw a few bombs around that might blow up Abbott a bit."" 

Turnbull : ""Well that's what you're saying. And that is what Andrew Bolt is saying. And it is doing the Labor Party's work."" 

Maybe time heals all wounds, but the conservative commentators – Jones especially – might have to eat a large piece of humble pie. Will Turnbull become the first leader who doesn't feel the need to tug the forelock to Jones? 

3. Barnaby Joyce and the Nationals 

Many senior Nationals deeply dislike Turnbull over the way he acted on carbon pricing when he was opposition leader in 2009, but none more so than Barnaby Joyce. One sees himself as the smartest guy in the room; the other is a clever bush politician. 

It was Joyce who declared in 2009, that Turnbull ""is not my leader"", after Turnbull revealed in an interview he had been duchessed by the ALP to join them. 

Immediately after the ballot this week Joyce held a late-night press conference to remind Turnbull that he should take account of his party's ""key values"". 

Expect some sparks between Joyce and Turnbull, particularly if Joyce replaces Warren Truss as leader in the future. 

4. Monarchists and conservatives 

The distrust of Turnbull runs particularly deep among monarchists, who are well represented among the conservative faction of the parliamentary Liberal Party. The Australian Republican Movement gave Turnbull his platform into public life. He then knocked off a leading monarchist, Peter King, who was in the way of his running for Wentworth. 

King later claimed in Parliament that Turnbull told him to ""f--- off and get out of my way"". 

Even though Turnbull has declared he's not about to reignite a debate over Australia becoming a republic, there are many who remember a brasher Turnbull, who was prepared to ridicule their stance of opposing the republic. 

5. The Packer camp 

Australia's scariest media mogul, Kerry Packer, has shuffled off his mortal coil and Canadian media mogul Conrad Black has lost his knighthood and fortune. But back in 1991 Packer was incandescent with rage at Turnbull for derailing the Tourang bid for Fairfax. Packer was forced to pull out after diary notes put together by Packer executive Trevor Kennedy were sent to the Australian Broadcasting Authority, recording that despite assurances, Packer planned to have a big say in how Fairfax was run. This would have put him in breach of the cross-media laws. 

""He told me he'd kill me, yeah,"" Turnbull said in a profile in 2009. 

""I didn't think he was completely serious, but I didn't think he was entirely joking either. Look, he could be pretty scary."" 

We're assured that Kerry's son, James Packer, is on good terms with Turnbull these days and has even visited his home. But is this incident completely forgiven and forgotten?",efab9511-8460-42b9-b981-f609c9f21133,News,2015-09-20T00:09:21Z,Brisbane Times,PM's rich and powerful enemies,0.0,News
3044,"Castro’s Cuba 
 
Archant 
   
Two Oxford photographers will be joined by the Cuban photographer Juan Manuel Cruz del Cueto in an exhibition to be staged at St John’s College in St Giles, Oxford, 10 October 
  Castro’s Cuba 
One of the last vestiges of the Cold War - the stand-off between Cuba and the United States- came to an end this autumn with Cuba and the Unites States resuming diplomatic relations. 

This October also sees the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Cuban communist party. 

To mark these events, two Oxford photographers will be joined by the Cuban photographer Juan Manuel Cruz del Cueto in an exhibition to be staged at St John’s College in St Giles, Oxford. 

The Oxford exhibition – Castro’s Cuba – Hardship and Opportunity - opens on October 10th  Cuba’s Independence Day. It will be open to the public until October 24th. 

The Oxford photographers Uwe Ackermann and Robin Laurance have both travelled widely in Cuba, facing challenges that only Cuba can present.  Their work shows a side of Cuba rarely seen by tourists.  Laurance is an established photojournalist and the Founding Director of the Oxford Photography Festival. He lives in Summertown. 

Ackermann is a Professor Emeritus of Physiology who followed Castro’s example of arriving for his first visit to Cuba by boat. (The two Castro brothers famously arrived by motor yacht with their fellow revolutionaries in 1956.)  Ackermann, an experienced sailor and photographer, lives in Botley. 

Juan Manuel Cruz del Cueto has documented areas of Cuban life only accessible to insiders. He has worked with the UN and UNICEF and has gained special permission from the Cuban authorities and the British Home Office to visit Oxford during the exhibition. 

Castro’s Cuba  -  Hardship and Opportunity  will be at the Barn Galleries, St John’s College from October 10th – October 24th.    Opening times :  10.00am – 4.00pm.  Entry is free. 

Photographs from the exhibition will be available to the media prior to the opening. 

Juan Manuel Cruz del Cueto will be available for interviews during the first week of the exhibition. 

A press and private view will be held at the galleries from 6 till 8 PM on October 1",ab736417-9150-4373-a99f-cc0d9662d6c6,News,2015-09-29T12:47:44Z,Cotswold Life,Oxford exhibition to mark new period in Cuba’s history,0.0,News

5905,"“From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.” It’s an old idea, but one that has increasing relevance in an era where automation is likely to permanently tilt the balance between capital and labor well off the scale. When all the jobs are done by robots, and the robots are owned by a small group of people, and there’s no way to earn enough money through labor to buy robot capital of your own, then won’t we have entered a stasis of sorts in society? And won’t the bolder thinkers among us then propose that the spoils of the robot labor be divided equally? And won’t they have a bit of a point? 
 
There’s also the idea that if you have something that you don’t need, and someone else needs something that they don’t have, and the “something” in question is the same thing , that the reasonable thing to do is to hand that thing that you don’t need over to the someone who needs it. This was the argument I used in 1987 when my brother, known to all and sundry as “Bark M”, found himself in possession of a set of new Z-Mags thanks to our parents liking him best. He didn’t need another set of wheels, but I’d just broken my back wheel riding off a loading dock for no reason at all, so I requisitioned his Z-Mags for my own use. This was made easier by the fact that I was fifteen years old and he was nine. That’s another lesson: equitable redistribution usually requires unreasonable force. 
 
So what does this have to do with the Nissan Maxima, recently summarized in these electronic pages? 
 

Well, it’s simple. Nissan doesn’t need the Maxima. If you take a look at GoodCarBadCar, you’ll see that the Max struggles to do 60,000 sales a year . You can easily see that the Avalon thumps it , but what you perhaps cannot see in those sales figures is that the average Avalon buyer is a well-heeled Baby Boomer who buys the Limited Hybrid model and pays full whack at the dealer while the average Maxima buyer is a rental-car company that expects a free-fall discount. 
 
I don’t think you can make the case that the Maxima particularly helps Nissan. At best, it’s some extra fleet volume; at worst, it’s a showroom albatross that, when discounted to prices the customer will pay, clashes embarrassingly with the high-end Altimas. Think of it as an anti-halo car. With a halo car, the process works like this: 
 Customer comes in to see the Hellcat  Customer finds out, to his neurotypical surprise, that you can’t get one for $399 a month  But wait! The Challenger SXT can be had for $399 a month!  Customer leaves with Challenger SXT  
With an anti-halo car, it works like so: 
 Customer comes in to see the Altima  Customer sees Maxima with giant SALE banner  Customer compares price of discounted Maxima with less-discounted Altima  Sees that Maxima is a better deal  Doesn’t really like the Maxima  But he’ll be damned if he’ll pay just as much for an Altima as he would pay for the Maxima he doesn’t want  Customer leaves, buys a Camry, which is what his wife wanted him to do anyway  
You, the intelligent reader, can see the superiority of the first business model over the second. “But wait,” you are saying, “that applies to the old Maxima, not this new and improved one.” Alas, dear reader, it does not matter. We no longer live in an era where the excellence of a particular product has much in the way of redemptive quality. Market positioning and brand power rule the roost. (If you’re reading this on an iPhone, then Q.E.D.) The Maxima has neither. Not only does the Maxima name mean less than nothing, the Nissan brand has precisely zero upmarket cachet. It doesn’t even have the sort of millionaire-next-door cred that Toyota and, to a lesser degree, Honda enjoy. If you take a moment to consider your own mental images of “base Altima owner” and “base Camry owner” you will see that I am correct. 
 
So Nissan could stand to lose the Maxima and be none the worse off for it. The dealers would use the resulting empty room on their lots for Muranos and Rogues, which sell at closer to MSRP in far less time. The existing Maxima customer base would just specify another car for their “Premium (or similar)” level, probably the Buick LaCrosse or Hyundai Azera. This is a victimless execution. 
 
Except, of course, for the factory and its workers, who have an expectation of being permitted to build some Maximas. There’s also the matter of paying for the tooling and honoring the supplier contracts and whatnot. So the efficiency-minded among us might be tempted to ask, “If Nissan doesn’t need the Maxima, is there anyone who does ?” 
 
Chrysler could certainly use a large front-wheel-drive car, that’s for sure, and they even have a name set aside for it: Dodge Diplomat. A Pentastar-powered Maxima, yclept Diplomat, would be a very nice thing. It would certainly outsell the Maxima. GM, too, could use a front-wheel-drive platform with origins in this millennium, but the current Impala is really just about as nice as the Maxima and they already have the brochures printed, so we can forget about that. 
 
Is there anyone else who is suffering from lack of a semi-prestige front-wheel-drive large sedan? 
 
Well, the image at the top of this column gives it away, doesn’t it? The company that most needs a Maxima is Nissan’s own sub-brand, Infiniti. 
 
“But wait,” you say, “Infiniti’s brand values don’t include some big Fail-Wheel-Drive barge.” I assume you’re kidding, dear reader. Infiniti has no brand values whatsoever. It’s always been a grab-bag of whatever Nissan had sitting around the Japanese showrooms. The original Q45 was a Nissan President — although, to be fair, the idea of the Q45 was certainly on Nissan’s mind when the President was being developed. The Q-cars that followed were rebadged Nissan Cimas with virtually no US-market development. The G35 that took over as the “heart of the brand” was a Skyline. Only the FX-thingys were really meant from the jump to be exclusively Infinitis. The current lineup is a dog’s breakfast of awkward-looking SUVs and the Q50, which is lovely inside but doesn’t really exude much sporting intent. 
 
Over at Lexus, by contrast, they have the almighty LS which was only incidentally a Celsior and the RX which was only incidentally a Harrier, and they drive the business from the halo and volume perspectives. Until recently, the Lexus brand didn’t include “sport” or “aggression” in its list of priorities, but the third-generation IS has really taken off. Guess what? It outsells the G35/Q50 most months. 
 
Think about that for a minute. The standard-bearer of entry-level Lexus sedans is the ES, but the side-piece IS is beating the G35/Q50 all by itself. This is roughly equivalent to what would have happened had Pat Boone’s In A Metal Mood become the best-selling rock album in America, and it amounts to a white glove across Nissan’s face. 
 
What’s Nissan to do? The answer is obvious: resurrect the I35, which was a Nissan Cefiro, which was kind of a Maxima. As a Nissan, the Maxima makes a great Infiniti. It could be restyled with the current bland Infiniti corporate face, filled with gadgets, marked up a bit, and sent out to do battle with the ES350. Of course, they couldn’t call it an I35 because of the monumentally moronic naming scheme they have in place now, but that’s a fix for another day. 
 
The truth is that front-wheel-drive big sedans work better for the average entry-luxury buyer than the sporting RWD/AWD four doors do. There’s more room, lower price, more predictable driving dynamics. That’s why the Lexus ES continues to beat the Lexus IS in showrooms despite being conspicuously absent from television ads and marketing campaigns. In time, the Q-Maxima would surely beat the Q50 in the showrooms, for the above reasons. If the sales volume didn’t immediately match what the N-Maxima does, that would be considerably offset by the lack of rental-car discounts. 
 
Everybody wins. Nissan sloughs off a car they don’t need. Infiniti gets a product that it desperately needs. The Maxima makes a better Infiniti anyway and I’d like to see it with the absolutely stunning interior makeover that came with Q50. Seriously. If you haven’t looked in a high-end Infiniti lately, you should. They really have that stuff down. So why not put it on the lower-cost platform that could be made right here in the United States, and take the fight to Lexus? 
 
Let me not to this marriage of product and placement admit impediments. Yet I fear that there are, in fact, impediments, and I fear they are too strong to be overcome. Chief among them are an unwillingness to accept change and reluctance to admit fault. No doubt we would hear that the Infiniti I35 failed to set the world on fire its first time around — but didn’t socialism actually set the world on fire its first time around, and won’t we all still see the red mist the day the robot comes to sit at our desks?

5915,") - Dr. Neal Locker, a leading Duncansville family dentist, is continuing his partnership with a local career institute to provide hands-on training to aspiring oral health professionals. 

Dr. Locker, who operates Gentle Family Dentistry, is hosting his sixth student from the YTI Career Institute, a postsecondary center dedicated to providing students with training opportunities in high-demand industries and fields. 
   
The student is part of a 12-week, hands-on program that follows the required dental assisting curriculum. 

""This training program is a great opportunity for the student, the institute and our practice,"" Dr. Locker said. ""After the training, the students have the highest level of dental training and become a more valuable employee down the road. We also benefit because this is often how we find our gems for Gentle Family Dentistry."" 

The students under Dr. Locker’s supervision undergo a standard clinical rotation that covers all phases of general dentistry. Dental assistants at Gentle Family Dentistry work with Dr. Locker to provide quality and compassionate dentistry to every patient. ""The training is time consuming but a worthwhile adventure as we invest in growth and the future of the dental industry,"" Dr. Locker said. 

Gentle Family Dentistry is a modern, five-operatory practice with state-of-the-art equipment. The practice, 510 Third Ave., offers cleanings, smile makeovers, crowns and bridges, dentures and partial dentures, deep bleaching, snoring and sleep apnea appliances, composite white fillings, root canal therapy, extractions and gum disease treatment. Gentle Family Dentistry offers nitrous oxide and oral conscious sedation for patients who have a fear of the dentist. 

The Duncansville dental practice uses the latest technology to treat patients. The office offers digital X-rays, which reduce radiation by up to 90 percent, and The Wand for painless Novocain delivery every time. Dr. Locker introduced The Wand to help ease patients’ fears of the dentist. Now his patients can expect pain-free Novocain delivery while they undergo restorative or cosmetic procedures. 

Dr. Locker takes a special interest in nutrition and naturalistic health maintenance, and he works to educate patients on how their oral health affects their overall health. Dr. Locker writes and manages a blog on his website that provides dental health tips and discusses new studies and trends in dentistry. 

Dr. Locker is a U.S. Army veteran who served in Vietnam. He grew up in Passaic, N.J., and attended Rutgers University for his undergraduate studies and then New Jersey Dental School (now Rutgers School of Dental Medicine). After graduating dental school, Dr. Locker joined the U.S. Air Force and spent three years at Langley Air Force Base in Hampton, Va. He later joined the U.S. Public Health Service and served one year on the Navajo reservation. Dr. Locker worked for general dental practices in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania before starting his own practice, Gentle Family Dentistry, in March 1994.

Snuggling up next to your kids to read them a bedtime story isn't just helping you bond with your little one.  

We've known for a while that reading to children is a great way to help kids learn how to read for themselves.   
 
But recent research also suggests that storytime has other benefits as well. Here are four of the main reasons why reading to children — especially when you do it regularly — could be crucial: 
 1. It stimulates parts of the brain associated with visual processing.   
A recent  study  highlighted by the  New York Times  found increased activity in the areas of children's brain associated with processing images, suggesting that even when kids aren't reading themselves, they are picturing the places they're hearing about. 
 
“When kids are hearing stories, they’re imagining in their mind’s eye,”  John S. Hutton, a clinical research fellow at  the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center and the lead author of the paper, told the Times . 
 2. It's different than just talking to them.   
Another  study  suggests that reading aloud to children starting when they're infants exposes them to more words than they might pick up from conversation alone. The study also suggested that reading aloud provides them with a better picture of a variety of sentence structures and vocabulary. 
  3. It may boost their ability to process information.    
A recent study  based on data from 4-and-5-year-old Australian children found that — even when they controlled for factors like their parents’ income and education levels — kids whose parents said they read to them at least 6 days a week scored higher on national tests designed to measure understanding and comprehension than those whose parents said they read to them just once or twice a week or less. The differing results appeared to hold steady roughly until the kids reached age 10. 
 4. It may help them problem solve.   
In a survey  of 9-month-olds in Ireland, researchers found that children whose mothers said they read and talked to them ""often"" or ""always"" up until that age performed better on a private questionnaire used by the University of California San Francisco and the University of Oregon   than those whose moms said they read to them ""rarely,"" ""never,"" or ""not at all,"" even when controlling for mother's income and education levels.

8386,"Reading through the commentary in the press and on social media it amazes me how snarky and nitpicking people are about Pope Francis’ visit.
I think it was pretty much universally appreciated that he skipped lunch with Pelosi, Biden, Boehner and the other nitwits on Capitol Hill in favor of visiting with the homeless, but other complaints illustrate people’s negativities, narrow mindedness and ignorance.
Here’s are a few nits that were picked:
1. “The Pope should have given Obama a lecture about abortion in his White House speech?” I made this grumble to start with, then I thought it through. He was being received as Head of State. This was a diplomatic event. At diplomatic events both sides give speeches that express admiration for the other country and leader. Both leaders give speeches that build bridges and improve relationships. Both leaders find common ground and tiptoe around the tension points.
2. “The Pope didn’t even mention the name of Jesus in the White House speech. Harrumph.” Again. This was a diplomatic event. At this point he was not evangelizing explicitly. In this context the Pope is speaking in a multi cultural nation to people of many denominations and religions. His role at that point is to find common ground, shared principles and values for all. So he spoke of “our common home” the climate change issue, human rights, religious freedom and referenced “the Creator”. PS: Benedict XVI also did not mention abortion or Jesus in his visit to the White House.
3. The Pope Fell Asleep During Mass - So the man is 78 years old, not in the best of health, has a heavy schedule and he’s also not allowed to suffer from jet lag?
4. The Pope Didn’t Smile Enough Standing Next to the President - Would you?
5. They had Protestants singing Protestant music for the Pope - Do you know of any good Catholic choirs?
6. The Pope’s Plane Was Too Early -
7. The Pope spoke about climate change to divert attention from the pedophile priest scandal.
8. The Pope stopped the motorcade to talk to a little girl. That was creepy
9, The Pope kissed an old woman. That was sexist.
10. The Pope’s National Anthem was long and boring. I like the Star Spangled Banner Better
OK. So I made up a few, but you get the idea. People should relax and be happy the Pope is here.

2411,"NEW YORK—Relatives of Sept. 11 victims marked the anniversary of the terror attacks Friday at ground zero with grief, gratitude and appeals to keep the toll front of mind after the passage of 14 years. 
 
Over 1,000 people — fewer than thronged the observance in its early years — gathered for what has become a tradition of tolling bells, moments of silence and the reading of the names of the nearly 3,000 people killed in the terror strikes at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. 
 
“We come every year. The crowds get smaller, but we want to be here. As long as I’m breathing, I’ll be here,” said Tom Acquaviva, 81, who lost his son, Paul Acquaviva. 
 
Carrying photos emblazoned with the names of their loved ones, victims’ relatives praised first responders, thanked the armed forces and hoped for peace and security: “Pray to our God to keep America safe and give the politicians the knowledge to keep America safe,” said Maria Perez, who lost her son, Anthony Perez. 
 
One woman in the crowd collapsed during the ceremony, apparently overcome by grief; bystanders helped her to her feet. But mostly, victims’ relatives sent personal messages of enduring loss and remembrance to loved ones some had never even had the chance to know. 
 
“Please know,” Kristin Vanacore said to the memory of her brother, Edward Raymond Vanacore, “that you and all of the other victims will never be forgotten.” 
 
In Washington, President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama stepped out of the White House at 8:46 a.m. — when the first plane hit the north tower — to observe a moment of silence. Later Friday, President Obama was scheduled to observe the anniversary with a visit to Fort Meade, Maryland, in recognition of the military’s work to protect the country.

The Flight 93 National Memorial near Shanksville in western Pennsylvania was marking the completion of its $26 million visitor center, which opened to the public Thursday. At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Ash Carter and other officials were joining in remembrances for victims’ relatives and Pentagon employees. 
 
Sacramento, California, was commemorating 9/11 in conjunction with a parade honoring three friends who tackled a heavily armed gunman on a Paris-bound high-speed train last month. Two tunnels in Idaho Springs, Colorado, were renamed the Veterans Memorial Tunnels, and a cross-shaped steel sculpture taken from the rubble of the World Trade Center went on display at Dallas Love Field airport. 
 
Some Americans were observing the anniversary in their own ways. 
 
“I don’t go to the memorial. I don’t watch it on TV. But I make sure, every year, I observe a moment of silence at 8:46,” electrician Jeff Doran, 41, said Friday as he stood across the street from the trade center, where the signature, 1,776-foot One World Trade Center tower has opened since last Sept. 11. 
 
After years of private commemorations at ground zero, the anniversary now has become an occasion for public reflection on the site of the terror attacks. 
 
An estimated 20,000 people flocked to the memorial plaza on the evening of Sept. 11 last year, the first year the public was able to visit on the anniversary. The plaza was to open three hours earlier after the anniversary ceremony. 
 
In Washington, some members of Congress planned to spend part of the anniversary discussing federal funding for the ground zero memorial. The House Natural Resources Committee has scheduled a hearing Friday on a proposal to provide up to $25 million a year for the plaza. The federal government contributed heavily to building the institution; leaders have tried unsuccessfully for years to get Washington to chip in for annual costs, as well.

An estimated 21 million people have visited the plaza for free since its 2011 opening. The museum, which charges up to $24 per ticket, has seen almost 3.6 million visitors since its May 2014 opening, topping projections by about 5 percent. 
 
This year’s anniversary also comes as advocates for 9/11 responders and survivors are pushing Congress to extend two federal programs that promised billions of dollars in compensation and medical care. Both programs are set to expire next year. 
 
Army Sgt. Edwin Morales had those responders in mind as he attended the ground zero ceremony in remembrance of his cousin firefighter Ruben “Dave” Correa. 
 
“People are still dying because of what happened,” both on battlefields and from illnesses that some who responded to the attacks have developed after exposure to toxic dust, Morales said. 
 
After Jyothi Shah read names in memory of her slain husband, Jayesh Shantitlal Shah, she paused to send him her love and the public her appreciation. 
 
“My kids and I would like to humbly thank everyone who has helped us, through the last 14 years, to be able to gently go through the sorrows, the suffering, the pain,” she said. “Thank you all very much — the city, the nation, the friends, the family.”

6996,"UPDATE : Bolsinger is starting Sunday, so we’re rolling with Martin Perez (@OAK, @HOU) in his place. 
 
We’re coming down the home stretch, and with it we’ve found a little bit more luck with regards to wins and losses. Hopefully that can continue as players are in crunch time with fantasy league playoffs. Onto this week’s recs… 
 
Here are the totals through week 21 (with updates from previous listing): 
 
35-48 record (4-1) 
4.67 ERA (-0.07) 
7.0 K/9 (same) 
2.3 K/BB (same) 
1.41 WHIP (same) 
 
Here’s a look at this week’s recs, with team wRC+ in parentheses. Y! ownership numbers usually pulled courtesy of twitter pal @PandapPete21 (but not this week) whom you should give a follow: 
 
LHP Eduardo Rodriguez – 36.3% ESPN – v. TBR (99), v. BAL (97) 
 
Rodriguez has quietly strung together five really nice starts since the Marlins cleaned his clock five weeks ago (eight earned in five innings). That stretch has brought his season ERA down from 4.83 to 3.94, and looked a little like this: 1.72 ERA, .666 OPS against and 26-7 K/BB ratio in five starts (31.1 innings). He’s strangely been hit harder by lefties (.380 wOBA) than righties (.285) this season, so I do have a little concern about he’ll fare against Chris Davis . But given this week’s paucity of good recs and Rodriguez’ most recent success, I still think he has a good chance to be an asset. 
 
RHP Chris Heston – 39.4% ESPN – @SDP (90), @OAK (97) 
 
Heston and the Giants have been snakebitten, as the team has lost his last seven starts dating back to early August. And while Heston hasn’t been great over that time frame, he’s been a bit better of late, allowing three earned runs in five innings with eight strikeouts last time out against the Reds. The issue for Heston has been going deep into games. Since Aug. 1, Heston has completed six innings just once in eight starts. And while some of that is surely the NL at play, and perhaps in September it might also be expanded rosters, it’s less encouragement than you’d like to see from a guy who completed six innings in all five of his July starts. But I’d like to bet on Heston rebounding against a couple of offenses that have been stuck in neutral for much of the season. The Padres have hit markedly better in the second half, but I still don’t see that as an offense that emits considerable worry from fantasy owners. Oakland has just a 95 wRC+ in the second half, and is quite often churning out lineups that look like outfits from the Salvation Army. It’s worked better in September, but I don’t think that’s enough of a sample size to chase me off Heston. 
 
RHP Mike Bolsinger – 13.7% ESPN- v. AZ (96), @COL (84) 
 
The Rockies on the road can be a little scary, but this is also a team whose second-half wRC+ is just 78. Only the woebegone Braves (77) are worse, and they’ve lost 26 of their last 30 games. Bolsinger has had a couple so-so outings after returning from Triple-A, with a win and a no-decision in which he lasted only 3.2 innings. That the Dodgers could send a guy to Triple-A with a sub-3.00 ERA in more than 15 starts is pretty impressive, but with Mat Latos scuffling and now DFA’d, it looks like Bolsinger is pretty safe as the team’s No. 5 guy. That’s a pretty luxurious thing. I’m not terribly worried about the Diamondbacks even though they gave him trouble last time out, as I think sometimes those struggles in the first outing of a back-to-back can benefit the pitcher in terms of game planning and that sort of thing. And again, I’d rather use him than someone like Matt Wisler this week.

2404,"Running game story... 
  
PHOENIX - During most of Tuesday s pregame session with reporters, Giants manager Bruce Bochy discussed the imperative need to make offseason adjustments to an aging and tire-slicked rotation. 
  
Then 40-year-old Tim Hudson returned to the rotation, spun six effective innings and even blasted a home run into the left field seats in the Giants 6-2 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks 
  
This game will age you. And yet there are nights when it can make you feel like a kid again. 
 
 
  
At this point where I am, I never know if it s going to be my last one, said Hudson, a day earlier. I ll go for as long as I can get, and hopefully it s further than what people would expect for me anymore. 
  
Odds are, this one won t be the last. Hudson raged against the dying light while picking up his 221st major league victory, the most among all active pitchers, after holding Arizona to a run on four hits. He joined 38-year-old Ryan Vogelsong, who homered five days earlier on this trip, as the oldest Giants pitchers to hit a home run since 41-year-old Steve Carlton in 1986. 
  
His home run in the third inning loosened up a Giants dugout that had become a tense place as the club fell to the extreme fringes of two playoff races. But it was not all guffaws and grins. 
  
The Giants had their All-Star middle infield combination reunited on the field again for all of four innings. Second baseman Joe Panik made his first start since Aug. 1, but shortstop Brandon Crawford left the game in the fourth after aggravating both his tight oblique and his swollen calf. Crawford made a difficult play to his right in the first inning and then did not appear comfortable while striking out twice. 
  
Hudson, making his first start since July 26, utilized his middle infield as much as he could. His first six outs were ground balls to Crawford or Panik, and his sinker remained true all night. 
  
Hudson was making the start in place of Vogelsong, who struggled in his last two outings. It s the kind of cobbling that Bochy has done most of the season, hoping to get a reliable run of starts from a rotation that had far too many flaws after Madison Bumgarner. 
  
Bochy made no secret that he would like to re-sign Mike Leake, who will be a free agent. Jake Peavy is under contract for another year and should have a longer offseason to recuperate. Bochy also is committed to Matt Cain reestablishing himself after a rocky season of self-discovery while pitching with a different range of motion following elbow surgery a year ago. 
  
With Cain, time will help him and he ll be a fixture in this rotation, Bochy said. 
  
Tim Lincecum could return, too, although the Giants cannot put themselves in a position to rely on him. They learned their lesson after this season. 
  
The window doesn t stay open all the time, Bochy said. It s amazing how healthy they ve all been until recently. It s why you sit down and discuss it, because we are getting a little older and we ll have to make some adjustments. 
  
Could the Giants get by with a rotation that includes Leake and the returnees, with Chris Heston a part of the starting five and Clayton Blackburn in position to provide depth? Could they seek to win by outhitting teams, instead? Or do they need to be in the wildly expensive market for a potential free agent such as Jordan Zimmermann, David Price or Zack Greinke? 
  
Bochy made it clear: he d like his new window to resemble the old one, stressing pitching and defense. 
  
That would be our preference because of the success we ve had, and because of our ballpark, Bochy said. Also when you look at the pitchers we have in our division, you ve got to match up with them. The reason for our success is our pitching and being able to match up against those other teams top three. 
  
The thing you don t forget is what these guys have done for you. You always have a special place for these guys. We ll have to get this figured out, though. 
  
Vogelsong is almost certainly in his final month as a Giant after a heartwarming career renaissance. Hudson, who plans to retire after this season, pitched the first eight innings of the Giants critical, 18-inning win at Washington in the NL Division Series last year. 
  
Oh, he s been a pleasure, Huddy, a great teammate and a great asset, Bochy said. He was a big part of our winning a World Series. I ve enjoyed my time with Huddy. That was a great sign for us. One of the huge motivators we had was to win with Huddy on the club. 
  
The Giants five-run third inning started from the bottom up, as the Nos. 8-9 hitters crushed back-to-back home runs. Gregor Blanco initially slid into third base with a triple before umpires singled that his drive to center cleared the yellow line and sent him home. Then Hudson turned on a 1-1 fastball from Chase Anderson and sent the Giants dugout roaring its applause. Hudson s fifth career home run, and his first since 2013, was a no-doubt shot off the bat. And it was a reminder that long ago, he once broke Frank Thomas single-season RBI record at Auburn. 
  
First Vogelsong. Then Hudson. Since when is Budweiser a performance enhancing drug? 
  
Panik tapped into the power show as well, following up his pinch double Monday night with a banner game that included an RBI double and his eighth home run of the season. 
  
-- 
The Giants activated left-hander Jeremy Affeldt from the disabled list and made one other roster move, purchasing the contract of right-hander Cory Gearrin from Triple-A Sacramento. 
  
Gearrin, 29, had a nice year in relief for the River Cats, posting a 2.72 ERA in 33 games while striking out 46 against 14 walks in 43 innings. Gearrin made 77 appearances for the Atlanta Braves from 2011-13 before undergoing Tommy John surgery. The Giants transferred catcher Hector Sanchez to the 60-day disabled list to clear a space for Gearrin on the 40-man roster.

Published: View comments With meadows and gardens strewn with an abundance of wild and beautiful flowers, stunning blooms are a spring and summertime given.

But as the days shorten and luscious gardens begin to wind down, many flower lovers find themselves struggling to carve out their own autumnal style.

Traditionally, as autumn approached, flower lovers went for warmer tones to provide a much-needed romance and intensity following the bright colours of summer.

But the autumnal palette has evolved over the years and experts say people are now opting for bold flashes of colour to add warmth to those gloomy pre-winter days.

They even predict a surge in the unlikely but ever faithful chrysanthemums, previously seen as a pervasive and somewhat unexciting bloom.

Simon Richards, flower expert at Marks & Spencer, says: 'Traditionally everyone thought russets, orange and gold was the only way to go for autumn arrangements in the home.

'But we're now much more sophisticated and varied in our choices, with people choosing to inject more flashes of vibrant colour – like hot pink gerberas - in autumn instead.' 

There's also a growing trend for potted trees - which hark back to the natural, more foraged style of horticulture - as well as bright, rich tones for the blushing autumnal bride.

So, what should you be picking - or, more likely, buying - now summer is on its last legs? We give you the top new floral trends from autumn: 

1) ROSES

The delicate rose will, of course, always be a popular choice to prettify the home. But because they are available in almost any hue, these beautiful and opulent flowers are perfect for an autumnal colour scheme.

Bi-colour roses really stand their ground during this season and are great either mixed in with some dark green foliage or simply standing alone in a contemporary vase.

Popular colours include deep oranges versions that run into misty colours such as peach, and dark red that run into cerise. Mix both together for an burst of excitement which will bring masses of colour into your home.

2) ROSEHIPS

The British public has always gone mad for rosehips in autumn - and this year is no exception.

The cherry-sized red fruits are available until November, meaning they can provide a freshly-picked, almost stripped-back feel right through the autumn months.

The red-orange hedgerows can look as good on their own as they do mixed up with strong, deep-green foliage and soft, classic cream roses.

'Foliage in general really picks up in autumn – with rosehip and hypericum berries most popular,' says Simon. 

'After the brightness and vibrancy of summer, autumnal berries, fruits and seasonal foliage can add new and different texture and character.' 

A perfect example is this stunning wicker basket of rose hips, pittosporum and dyed eucalyptus, which is available from M&S for £35. 

3) THE COMEBACK OF THE CHRYSANTHEMUM

Previously seen as ubiquitous and naff, flower experts are predicting a comeback for the reliable chrysanthemum, as flower lovers seek to inject a bold splash of colour into their vases.

'We're not talking the all-year-round garage forecourt style versions but instead, beautiful versions in autumnal colours that are also English grown,' says Simon. 

Boasting an extensive variety of hues, chrysanthemums can be suited to almost any colour scheme, but work particularly well for autumn in shades of white and pale pink, teamed with foliage or berries.

This warm and striking bouquet, consisting of Ruscus, standard carnation and orange chrysanthemums, is available from M&S for £35

4) CELEBRATE VALUE 

With several types of flowers nearing the end of their season, there is some great value to be found in autumn.

Recently back in fashion after several years off-trend, gladioli - seen by many as similar to the summer tulip - are still in season for the next four weeks and, with their structure and elegance, are a cheap and striking way to make a statement in the home.

Simon advises picking deep purple gladiolis before placing them in a tall vase.

This stunning bunch of gladiolis makes a fabulous and dramatic gift, and costs just £25 online at M&S, while smaller bunches are available in-store.

5) SUNFLOWERS 

Everyone's favourite summer bloom, sunflowers are still in season until the end of September, meaning they are not only easy to find but come at exceptional value.

The gloriously vibrant flowers look fabulous on their own but can also be mixed with autumn foliage and a flower such as the orange gladioli to create a more earthy ambiance.

6) DARING AUTUMN COLOURS

Choosing occasion flowers during spring and summer is a no-brainer: any pastel or bright, sunny colour scheme feels appropriate.

But for the bride that dares to be different, picking flowers during the autumn months can be invigorating, with a huge range of bolder colours with an autumnal twist to choose from. 

While darker richer tones - such as burgundy Chocolate Cosmos and Scabious - often appear in arrangement, the likes of hot pink gerberas and refreshing orchids are also becoming increasingly popular.

This orchid and rose collection, specifically developed with autumn weddings in mind, consists of one brides's bouquet and two bridesmaids' bouquets featuring pink orchids and deep pink roses, elegantly tied with cream ribbon. It is available to order for £175 from M&S. 7) PLANTED FLOWERS

A new trend spotted among horticultural experts are planted flowers, which make a great contrast to cut flowers at weddings and other formal occasions. 

This collection of potted plants, which is brimming with stunning soft pink roses and cascading ivy, not only looks divine, but could be used instead of written boards to show guests where they are to sit at the tables. 

A collection of soft pink roses and cascading ivy comes with a white wooden crate with cut-out heart detail to show the seating plan for the top table, plus five white terracotta planters filled with a soft pink rose plant to represent the seating on the other tables. 

There are also wooden chalkboards to write names or table plans on, and 50 wooden plant labels on which you can write your guests' names.

It is available at M&S for £70.

8) BACK TO BASICS 

The natural, 'just picked from the garden' style continues to heavily influence wedding flower designs this autumn, with captivating dahlias and garden roses taking centre stage.

Wedding planners should also look out for textural elements in the form of berries, grasses and ferns - all essentials for autumn flowers - to spruce up an existing arrangement.

Free-flowing bridal bouquets are sought after, with arching branches of foliage and vines providing movement and interesting textures.",7e91d072-b626-423b-9b50-324471e6eca8,News,2015-09-13T23:01:02Z,Mail Online UK,"Fabulous floral trends for now!

6132,"ONE in seven Scots believes they deserve eternal damnation – more than any other group in Great Britain. 
 
Across the country just one in ten believes that if hell existed they would end up there – but Scots seem to have a far dimmer view of their own virtue. 
 
A YouGov poll showed that a staggering 14% of Scots believe they deserve to burn in the fiery pits of hell. 
 
One in seven Scots believe they deserve eternal damnation 
 
  
 
The survey also showed that Scots are less afraid of death than the rest of Britain – and that they are less likely to believe in the afterlife. 
 
When Scots were asked “If there were a heaven and a hell, which would you end up in?” 48% claimed they would go to paradise – in line with the national average. 
 
But a staggering 14% said they would be sent to hell – 4% more than the figure for Great Britain as a whole. 
 
Meanwhile, when asked “How much does death scare you?” 28% of Scots claimed to be “not at all” scared – 3% higher than the national average. 
 
And just 16% of the population said death scared them “a lot” – less than the national average of 20%. 
 
Then asked whether they believed in the afterlife 30% said they definitely did not – significantly more than the national average of 24%. 
 
Freddie Sayers, YouGov editor in chief, said: ‘’Taking British adults as a whole, 1 in 10 believe that if there is an afterlife, they’re headed for hell. 
 
“This figure is slightly higher among Scottish people, at 14%, despite them being less afraid of death and less likely to believe in an afterlife than the rest of the population. 
 
“Taken together you could point to a certain cheerful resilience in this mindset – a kind of black humour. 
“One thing to remember is that only a minority of people (36%) believe in an afterlife at all. So this is really a measure of how people rate their own virtue more than a religious conviction.’’ 
 
Rev Colin Sinclair, minister at the Church of Scotland’s Palmerston Place Church in Edinburgh, and convener of the church’s mission and discipleship council said: “Death has been called “the last taboo,” so a survey on attitudes to death can make for uncomfortable reading. 
 
“In this survey the small differences between the attitude of those living in Scotland and the rest of the UK could reflect the down-to-earth nature of Scots character, the impact of cultural Calvinism and a refusal to run away from the reality of life.” 
 
Of the groups surveyed, Londoners seemed to have the highest estimation of their moral worth – with 52% believing they would go to heaven. 
 
And 40% of Brits said that if they died today they would die happy. 
 
27% of Scots also said that they would live forever if they could chose to – whilst 50% said they would turn down the offer, with the remaining 24% on the fence.",e3217711-0bd8-4490-b6a1-df917cec5f91,News,2015-09-10T17:07:03Z,Deadline News,14% of Scots believe they deserve Hell,0.0,Blog

3960,"Arsenal coach  Arsene Wenger and his partner Annie are understood to have completed their separation. 

According to the Mirror , the pair have divided their assets, agreed on a financial package and intend on going their separate ways. 

The tabloid report that court papers have been filed in Strasbourg, the manager’s birthplace and the closest city to Duttlenheim, the village where the coach was raised. The documents apparently indicate that the 65-year-old manager and his partner, 59, have not been together since the beginning of the summer. 

While not a full divorce, the papers—a ‘separe du corps—represent a legal separation. 

The report adds that the couple have not been pictured together since 2013, and note that the coach has previously confessed that the pressure of running the London giants has placed strain on his relationship. 

Back in 2008, as quoted by the Mirror, Wenger revealed a promise he had made to his wife to one day quit football in order to dedicate more time to their relationship. 

“Ten years ago I said to my wife [Annie], ‘Five more years and that’s all’, and I am still here. 

“It is difficult to find time to see them but there are jobs [which are worse]. You have guys who leave for work on Monday and come back on Friday. 

“In my job I travel, but the problem is not so much the quantity of time you spend with your family, it is the quality.

“That is where this job is more damaging. You do not always give them the quality they deserve when you are at home because you are thinking of the next game. 

“My wife likes watching football, she watches all the games of Arsenal at home. She is not a fanatic but she likes watching sports. No, she does not have much choice.” 

The couple have an 18-year-old daughter together, and were married in December 2010. 

Wenger is not the first manager to acknowledge the fact that a full-time role as a manager is hard to combine alongside a committed and dedicated family life. 

When Sir Alex Ferguson left Manchester United and retired from football, he admitted that his duty of supporting his wife, particularly following the death of her sister, was not something he could easily do alongside his responsibilities at Old Trafford [ Express ].

Carlos Carrasco tossed a shutout, striking out 15 batters and allowing one hit, a seventh inning single to Alex Rios. It was the second time this season Carrasco took a no-hit bid into the seventh inning, previously on July 1 when he went 8 2/3 before allowing a hit.
But that was not the most impressive part of his performance Friday.Shutout with 15 K & 1 or Fewer Hits Allowed
Carlos Carrasco became the 5th pitcher in MLB history to strike out at least 15 batters and allow 1 or fewer hits in a road shutout. Max Scherzer also did so earlier this season.

Making History
With those 15 K's, he now has 211 strikeouts on the season. With Corey Kluber, who has 230 strikeouts, Carrasco and Kluber become the first pair of Indians pitcher to strikeout 200-plus batters in a single season since the mound was lowered in 1969.
According to the Elias Sports Bureau, with his performance, Carrasco became the first pitcher in Indians team history to toss a shutout allowing one hit and striking out 15.
He also became the fourth American League pitcher in MLB History to toss a shutout striking out 15 and allowing one or no hits.
How Carrasco was able to dominate
Carrasco induced a miss on 40 percent of swings, his third-highest rate in a start in his career. Each of his career-high 15 strikeouts was on a swing and miss.
The Royals were 0-for-17 with 12 strikeouts against Carrasco’s off-speed pitches. The 12 K's against his off-speed pitches was also a career high.
Kansas City hitters chased 49 percent of Carrasco's pitches out of the zone, the fourth-highest rate in a start of his career.

Kudos to Howard Mandel for booking this act to open the Jazz Journalists Association Awards 2015 at the Blue Note Jazz Club. The focus of the evening was on Jazz piano, with Randy Weston receiving a lifetime achievement award, Women in Jazz (with Mimi Jones and Antoinette Montague performing) and African-Jazz ties (Fula Flute, made up of Bailo Bah –the master– and Sylvain Leroux, both playing the tambin.) 
I asked Sylvain to write about Fula Flute, and he was so eloquent, there was little for me to add: 
 
“Bailo and I have gone through many incarnations as Fula Flute and this time around we are going back to the fundamentals: the sound and energy of the tambin. Bailo and I have known and worked together since 1999—16 years now. We have gone through many phases and our relationship is strong. I consider him the way a martial arts student considers his master. I am good, but he is superior. However, although I am a student of his style of flute playing, I also have to some extent integrated the language of the Fula flute into my own expression which itself is informed with classical and jazz training and some wider World music experience and this gives me an ability to innovate in ways that he cannot. But it is very doubtful that I can ever approach his power, steeped as he is in the culture of his traditional village, located in the heart of the ancient and profound Fulani culture of Guinea, high in the mountains of the “Fouta Djallon.” 
 
In any case, I feel it is a privilege to be allowed to keep an accompaniment while he solos… to be like Noel Redding to Jimi Hendrix (to whom Bailo is often compared). Bailo respects me sufficiently to allow me to take solos and, from time to time, I play something that challenges him, which inevitably stimulates him to go further and then we see amazing fireworks as he is capable of playing at the highest level. He’s a “karamoko,” a sorcerer, and can generate real magic. Great African players are master of “nyama,” the life energy (kudalini, chi…) that they know how to stimulate and bring on the nirvanas that we experience as listeners. 
 
Bailo is an incredible person, he has had an amazing life—worth a book, at least—and is heir to profound knowledge, inherited as a child from his grandfather, of a rich but deeply different nature than what we normally refer to as “knowledge.” In his playing and in the message of the Fula flute is a hint of ancient ways that we would all be improved as a species if we integrated their lessons.”

3115,"From my intro thread... buddy and I rebuilt a 7ECA from the bones up.  We installed an O-320 via STC, a pretty 0 SMOH engine.  Added 10 gallons of fuel, she was ready to fly. 
My A&P buddy who did 90% of the work taxied out, added power for the maiden flight, rolled about 100' and the engine rolled back, WAY back, coughed once or twice. 

He did another high power runup... same deal.  The engine would not sustain TO power.  You could taxi all day, though.  Thank God he did not get airborne.  He'd have gone down straight ahead. 

Our best guess was that the tanks were not venting properly.  We checked the venting - it seemed OK - but just to be sure, we are going to use vented fuel caps for now to be on the safe side.  The wings came with unvented caps. 

Next step, checked fuel flow and cleanliness from the gascolator feeding the carb.  Pretty bright blue fuel, seems clean. 

Today, I am going to disconnect the fuel line from the carb and drain about 5 gallons of fuel, time it to see if fuel flow from the entire system is appropriate. 

Any other thoughts? Besides fuel, it MIGHT be air.  Inadequate air flow would result in an extreme over-rich condition at high power settings. 

Could mag timing cause power loss at high power settings? 

Right now, my bird is entirely unsafe to fly until we can correct this problem.   Inputs HUGELY appreciated.  Thanks!",30d355fe-677f-4444-bcb8-4df7b08127d1,News,2015-09-23T13:51:38Z,Pilots of America,My Citabria can't take off...,0.0,News

All of the roughly 19,000  members of the TV Academy belong to one of 29 ""peer groups"" (i.e., actors, writers, etc.) and are entitled to vote for the nominees — and, as of this year, also the win­ners — in the categories that pertain to their specific area of expertise; for series categories, all members vote. THR 's awards analyst Scott Feinberg spoke with one producer who has won an Emmy himself but who has no ties to this year's nominees to learn how he voted — and why. 
 
OUTSTANDING DRAMA SERIES 
 
I would have dumped Homeland , House of Cards and Downton Abbey and put in Bloodline , which was incredibly well done; The Good Wife , which made a really strong comeback this year and would have been nominated if it was on cable or a streaming service; and — don't laugh — Daredevil , a comic book show done ridiculously well that features the most watchable actor on television, Vincent D'Onofrio — in $5,000 suits! Downton Abbey , I confess, is not a show I watch; I've sampled it but I cannot get through it — I'd rather have hemorrhoid surgery. I wrote ""WTF?"" next to Homeland 's nomination; its first two seasons were as good as anything on television, but as soon as they — spoiler alert — hanged [ Damian Lewis during season three], it stopped being watchable and sort of became the drama version of the Tim Robbins show [ The Brink ]. I'm glad Orange Is the New Black , which has incredibly fresh performances and direction, was moved to the drama category; shows written in a room by comedy writers should compete against each other, but Orange isn't written that way and isn't that kind of a show. 

 
Kudos to Netflix for giving really creative people free range, which is how the best work gets made — although it also can go terribly wrong, as in the case of House of Cards . I binge-watched the first season in two days and was a huge fan; then it had a weak second season; and then it totally jumped the shark this season — I was literally looking around for Henry Winkler , a small pool, a shark and a motorcycle. They just lost their way with a Sam and Diane moment: [ Kevin Spacey 's Frank Underwood] wants to be president in the worst way — and they made him president! Don't. Do. That. (It did have one good episode, the season finale, thanks to Michael Kelly , who was the only reason I kept watching.) I did not expect Better Call Saul to get nominated, but it absolutely deserves to be in there. Mad Men will probably win for its last season, which was very good — I liked that they didn't wrap everything up in a bow but also didn't just cut to black like The Sopranos . But Game of Thrones is the most important show on television. The scale of it and the amount of talk it generates is unparalleled; nobody wants to get to Monday without having seen what happened on Sunday, and that takes me back to the way TV was when I was growing up. 
 
MY VOTE Game of Thrones (HBO) 
 

 
OUTSTANDING COMEDY SERIES 
 
I'm delighted Parks and Rec was nominated — there's an unfortunate prejudice against broadcast network shows, but Amy Poehler 's work was outstanding and the cast is extraordinary. Silicon Valley and Transparent should have been nominated — [ Silicon 's] T.J. Miller plays one of the funniest characters on television and [ Transparent 's] Judith Light is one of the most underappreciated actresses out there. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is terrific, but I was surprised it made it. I adore Modern Family and would have voted for it for the first three seasons, but it's now being nominated on its reputation — it did not have a very good season. Veep is a nice comedy — Julia Louis-Dreyfus is amazing — but I don't think the show is Emmy-worthy. (I would've taken out Modern Family and Veep and replaced them with Black-ish and Jane the Virgin .) But the bottom line is, there's Louie and then there's everything else. I don't understand how it hasn't already won. It's so groundbreaking and original; we'll look back on it as one of the great comedy series of all time. 
 
MY VOTE Louie (FX) 
 

 
'Louie' 
 
OUTSTANDING LIMITED SERIES 
 
First of all, it's nice to see a limited series category, but they still need to figure out what it means — it's like the three-card monte game of the Emmys. It should be easy to distinguish a limited series from a series: If you have a giant staff of writers and you're putting out a show with a different director every week, and you have actors who have contracts with options for multiple seasons, you're a series, and you shouldn't be able to compete as a limited series; if one or two guys are doing six or eight or 10 hours, you're a limited series. American Horror Story , which is not really my thing, is an out-and-out series — it's had a continuous writing staff, supervising director and EP. The same actors appear in every season and know, when they wrap one, that they're coming back for another — maybe as a different character in a different story, but so what? The same was true for The Twilight Zone , which was a drama series. Putting a colon in the title and changing the subtitle every year does not make you a limited series — and gives you the same sort of unfair advantage that putting "" Hallmark Hall of Fame: "" at the front of titles used to, which is frustrating for people who actually make limited series. 
 
American Crime is coming back, so it should be a drama series, but I liked it very much. I would never have nominated Wolf Hall or The Honorable Woman — they were like watching paint dry. HBO shows get nominated because they're on HBO, which spends an enormous amount of money telling America: ""We're not TV. We're HBO."" And it has worked — people internalize that and then vote for something in a category like this solely because it aired on HBO. There is no way Olive Kitteridge , with its pedantic pacing and obtuse storytelling, would have gotten the number of nominations it did — or would win, which it's going to — if it was on any other network. I'm going with American Crime , mainly because I can't vote for The Missing , which was the best thing on television this year. The fact that it wasn't nominated illustrates why it was a mistake to get rid of the blue-ribbon panels, which I used to serve on, for the nominations phase of voting. I didn't even know The Missing existed until someone told me to watch the screener, and thankfully Starz sent screeners of the whole thing, unlike some networks that send episodes one and seven or whatever ran­dom selections. 

 
MY VOTE  American Crime (ABC) 
 

 
'American Crime' 
 
OUTSTANDING TV MOVIE 
 
There are a lot of really hard-working TV movie producers out there and the mission of the Television Academy is to celebrate people like them who work in television every day — come to work, put on their headset and do everything they can to make movies in probably the most difficult genre left in our business. I think about the number of places that made TV movies 10 years ago and the number of places that make them now, and I take my hat off to the people who are still doing it. So what do they do? They nominate two feature films [ Grace of Monaco and Nightingale ] that just couldn't get theatrical releases and give them two slots that could have gone to people who actually make TV. Furthermore, are we really still so in love with the Brits that we're nominating stuff like Agatha Christie's Poirot: Curtain, Poirot's Last Case ? Prime Suspect is one thing, but are you kidding me — Poirot for the 400th time? I watched 15 minutes of it and fell asleep. Peter Ustinov put that to bed. I didn't care for Hello Ladies or Killing Jesus — I wish they had nominated Whitney , which had a stunning main performance. That leaves Bessie , which is absolutely a deserving winner. 
 
MY VOTE Bessie (HBO) 
 

 
'Bessie' 
 
OUTSTANDING VARIETY SKETCH SERIES 
 
I think SNL had a really off year — they're obviously the institution, but they're slacking. I love [ Inside Amy Schumer 's ] Amy Schumer  — she goes right out to the edge of the diving board every episode and never falls off, and her 12 Angry Men parody was the best episode of any of these shows. Portlandia and Drunk History are hit or miss. I voted for Key & Peele because it's the funniest show on television and I am so crushed they are going off the air — they are completely original, completely without parameters and will go after anyone in an unbelievably clever way. 
 
MY VOTE Key & Peele (Comedy Central) 

 
OUTSTANDING VARIETY TALK SERIES 
 
I can't quarrel with any of these nominees. [ Jimmy ] Kimmel and [ Jimmy ] Fallon are really good and reshaping the format — and I don't know why anyone would ever host an Emmys or an Oscars with some­one other than one of them. With [ Stephen ] Colbert , [ Jon ] Stewart and [ David ] Letterman all saying goodbye this year, this is sort of the farewell-tour category. I'm a dedicated Stewart fan — he changed the game and will always be the gold standard — but I think he was sort of mailing it in this year, as Letterman has been doing for several years. (I would have been happy to replace Letterman and Colbert with Conan [ O'Brien of Conan ] and [ Real Time 's Bill ] Maher .) But in my opinion, the best show, week to week, was John Oliver 's. Granted, he has a whole week to prep his show, while the others have to do four or five a week — but I imagine all those other guys also work with much bigger writ­ing staffs, which sort of evens the playing field. 
 
MY VOTE  Last Week Tonight With John Oliver (HBO) 
 

 
OUTSTANDING REALITY COMPETITION PROGRAM 
 
Boring. These are the same nominees every year and I wouldn't choose to watch any of them — I have never seen So You Think You Can Dance or Project Runway , but I have watched Amazing Race , Dancing With the Stars and The Voice because they have been on in my house. I called up my family and asked them what I should vote for and they told me The Voice , which I found acceptable because I do think [creator] Mark Burnett is the Ed Sullivan of our day. But at the end of the day, does anyone besides the people who make these shows really care? The Amazing Race has won 10 out of the 12 years: They're like the Celtics in the '60s — I don't know why anybody else bothers to suit up. 
 
MY VOTE The Voice (NBC) 
 

 
OUTSTANDING STRUCTURED REALITY PROGRAM 
 
I have seen every one of the nom­inated shows except Property Brothers . I'm a fan of MythBusters , but it's been on a long time and they've sort of run out of myths. There have been episodes of Undercover Boss that I've liked, but each one really depends on whether or not they've found a great boss. Nothing comes close to Shark Tank . I'm a huge Mark Burnett fan, and this one is so well done that its title has now become part of the lexicon. And any time I can see Mark Cuban berating other billionaires, how would I not be into that? 
 
MY VOTE Shark Tank (ABC) 
 
OUTSTANDING UNSTRUCTURED REALITY PROGRAM 
 
I don't watch any of these reg­ularly. I saw two episodes of Wahlburgers on an international flight when there was nothing else left to watch on my little TV. And I've seen a few episodes of Intervention and I respect what they do for people battling addiction.

The problem though is there is no good reason to feel that way.  If God wanted you to be in the same position as another person, He'd put you there & nothing could stop Him.  God has you where you are in life for a reason.

Bearcats quarterback Hayden Moore (8) during the game against the Memphis Tigers at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium. (Photo: Justin Ford-USA TODAY Sports) 

MEMPHIS, Tenn. – Redshirt freshman Hayden Moore broke the 47-year-old University of Cincinnati single-game passing mark held by Bearcats great Greg Cook, but the bottom line was a 53-46 UC loss to Memphis here Thursday night. 

Moore completed 31-of-53 passes for 557 yards, four touchdowns and two interceptions in playing just over three quarters, in relief of injured starter Gunner Kiel. 

Cook's record was 554 yards against Ohio University in 1968. UC had 752 total yards overall, breaking the school mark of 711 set against UConn in 2009. UC also set a school mark with 38 first downs. 

Scoring summary, stats: Memphis 53, UC 46 

Memphis running back Sam Craft scored from 3 yards out with 53 seconds left, breaking a 46-46 tie in the game-long shootout. It was the 12th lead change of the zany game. 

Moore quickly marched UC from its own 25 to the Memphis 19-yard line in the waning seconds. Then, Moore was spun around while attempting to pass and flung a pass forward, which hit the hands of UC running back Tion Green and then was intercepted by Memphis defender Leonard Pegues. 

With 10 seconds left, that was that. 

Moore relieved Kiel, who was knocked out of the game with a head injury late in the first quarter . This injury one appeared more serious than the hit that took Kiel out of UC's last game. 

A crowd of 45,172 was watching at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium, along with a national television audience on ESPN. 

Kiel left with 3:25 remaining in the first quarter, after a hit to his head by Memphis cornerback Chauncey Lanier. Memphis led 14-10 at the time. 

Kiel was hurt while rushing for a 3-yard gain. Replays showed Lanier hit Kiel with his shoulder, and there was no targeting foul called. Meanwhile, Kiel was down on the field for several minutes before being taken off on a cart. 

UC spokesman Ryan Koslen said Kiel later was awake and moving all four limbs in the Bearcats locker room. Kiel was taken to a Memphis hospital for further evaluation and his parents were with him, but there was no further update from UC. 

Kiel's playing status had been uncertain this week, after he also left with an injury during UC's 37-33 win at rival Miami University last Saturday. 

UC coach Tommy Tuberville initially indicated Kiel had suffered a head injury against Miami, but later said it was more to Kiel's shoulders. 

Thursday's game matched the preseason favorites to win the American Athletic Conference East (UC) and West (Memphis), as voted by league media. UC also was voted to win the inaugural AAC championship game, which will be Dec. 5. 

UC fell to 2-2 overall and 0-2 in the AAC East. Memphis is 4-0 overall and 1-0 in the AAC West, and the Tigers were a 10-point favorite. 

Memphis also entered with a 10-game overall winning streak, dating back to last year. 

UC entered with a seven-game winning streak in road AAC games, dating back to 2013. 

Kiel scored on a 4-yard run as UC took a 7-0 lead just 1:44 into the game. The score came shortly after a fumble by Memphis running back Craft, with the recovery by UC linebacker Eric Wilson at the Memphis 36-yard line. 

Memphis answered with a 59-yard interception return for a touchdown by defensive back Arthur Maulet, as Kiel threw the ball short. 

Maulet had nothing but open field ahead, and the Liberty Bowl crowd leaped to its feet as Maulet raced home to tie it 7-7 with 10:34 left in the first quarter. 

Andrew Gantz put UC back ahead 10-7, with a 35-yard field goal with 5:07 left in the first quarter. 

Memphis went up 14-10 on an 82-yard pass from quarterback Paxton Lynch to wide receiver Anthony Moore with 8:42 left in the first quarter. 

Kiel was knocked out with 3:25 left in the first quarter. Redshirt freshman Hayden Moore replaced Kiel, as he did last week against Miami. 

Moore threw a 68-yard touchdown pass to UC senior wide receiver Chris Moore (no relation) to give UC a 17-14 lead with 14:06 left in the second quarter. 

Memphis went back ahead 21-17 on a 9-yard run by receiver Mose Frazier, off of a straight handoff with 11:03 left in the second quarter. 

Gantz drew UC within 21-20 on a career-long 49-yard field goal with 9:14 left in the second quarter. 

Gantz put UC ahead 23-21 on a 32-yard field goal with 5:02 left in the second period, but that lead did not last long. 

Memphis went ahead 28-23 on a 4-yard TD run by Jarvis Cooper less than a minute later, set up by a 61-yard pass play. 

UC regained the lead at 30-28 on a 21-yard pass from Moore to Shaq Washington, with 1:46 left in the second quarter. 

Memphis put more defensive pressure on Moore in the second half, as the scoring pace slackened for both teams. 

Moore threw an interception that put Memphis at its own 48, and the Tigers took a 31-30 lead when Jake Elliott hit a 40-yard field goal with 3:36 left in the third quarter. 

UC regained the lead 33-31 on the fourth field goal of the game by Gantz, this one from 36 yards with 1:27 left in the third quarter. 

Memphis took the lead again, 38-33 on an 8-yard TD pass from Lynch to tight end Alan Cross with 13:30 left in the game. That was the ninth lead change of the night. 

UC marked the 10th lead change on a 40-yard pass from Moore to wideout Max Morrison with 10:02 left. A two-point conversion pass failed, leaving UC up 39-38. 

Lead change No. 11: Memphis with a 5-yard TD run by running back Sam Craft, and a two-point conversion run by Lynch gave the Tigers a 46-39 lead with 7:07 left. 

UC tied it 46-46 on a 30-yard TD pass from Moore to Morrison with 5:56 left, with Gantz adding the tying point with his PAT kick. 

With 2:22 left, UC's Mike Tyson appeared to force and recover a fumble at the Memphis 33-yard line. But, a replay review awarded the ball back to Memphis. 

UC entered the night ranked No. 7 nationally in total offense and Memphis was No. 8. The Tigers also were No. 5 nationally in scoring offense at 54.0 per game. 

BOONE OUT: UC sophomore running back Mike Boone (ankle) did not make the trip. Boone led UC last week with 118 yards rushing against Miami University, but he left that game with a tender ankle. 

Entering Thursday, Boone was No. 2 on the team in rushing with 220 yards and tied for the team lead with three touchdowns.

4845,"ISTANBUL:  A new march by migrants trying to reach Europe overland from Turkey was blocked by police outside Istanbul Monday. 
 
Around 700 mostly Syrian men, women and children from a group that had been blocked for the past week at Istanbul’s main bus station set out overnight on footfor the northwestern city of Edirne, 250 kilometres (150 miles) away. 
 
After spending the night camped on the hard shoulder of the motorway, some of the migrants, who carried bags over their shoulders, managed to clamber aboard buses or private vehicles.

But a few hundred continued to walk along the emergency lane, in the midst of snarling morning traffic, before being brought to a halt by police about 50 kilometres (31 miles) from Istanbul, an AFP photographer witnessed. 
 
Situated around 10 kilometres (six miles) from the Greek border and 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the Bulgarian frontier, Edirne has become a new rallying point for migrants trying to reach Europe. 
 
Encouraged by the #Crossingnomore social media campaign, which calls for migrants to be allowed to travel overland to Europe rather than risk their lives at sea, around 2,000 refugees flocked to the city last week.

Edirne’s governor has warned that any migrants trying to smuggle illegally into Europe through his province will be returned to refugee camps in southern Turkey. 
 
On Saturday, a group of migrants that spent five days camped behind police lines on the road outside Edirne, under a scorching sun, agreed to disperse after talks between a group of refugees and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu. 
 
“We are ready to send people to countries who open their doors to them, but unfortunately no country has given a favourable response so far,” Davutoglu wrote afterwards on Twitter.

Many of the Syrians pouring into Europe have been living in Turkey for months, sometimes years. 
 
Turkey has taken in over two million Syrians since 2011, of whom around 260,000 live in refugee camps.

Enjoy your bug-free burgers and cakes now, because worm-filled ice cream is coming.  Feeding the world's growing population is a challenge – there will be 11 billion of us by the end of the century. The problem is compounded by the effects of climate change. More extreme weather that results from global warming, like heavy rains and heat waves, threatens the global food supply.  Scientists have suggested for a while that we eat bugs as one way to solve looming food shortages. The Economist also made the case for bugs as a source of cheap and easy protein in an article last year.   Bugs are full of protein, calcium, and fibre, cheap to raise, and more sustainable than livestock. The major hurdle has been getting people, mainly Western cultures, to eat them.  According to The Economist, ""not having to look at the bugs, and emphasising the environmental benefits might make the idea of eating insects a bit more palatable.""

A LIFESAVING service committed to helping addicts get clean  would be severely impacted if Burton Magistrates' Court is axed, its founder has said. 

Noreen Oliver, founder of Burton Addiction Centre (BAC), has said the closure of the 105-year-old court would cost the service too much in manpower to provide support for its users elsewhere. 

Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service is currently consulting on whether to close the court, in Horninglow Street, and transfer all its cases to either Cannock or Southern Derbyshire magistrates' courts. 

Currently the BAC works with the criminal justice system to provide treatment which defendants are required to complete via conditions set out in a court order. Mrs Oliver said: ""If magistrates give out an order for rehabilitation and treatment, going to the court makes it a lot easier for us to work alongside them. 
 
""If the work went to Cannock or Derby then we would have a long trek to (be able to) work with the magistrates and determine what treatment they need. 

""I think if the court was moved there is the danger that people won't turn up for court. 

""It is a long trek for us and we don't have the resources to have someone out all day at court because of the cuts. So it will have an impact."" 

Mrs Oliver is the latest in a long line of people voicing their opposition to the plans. 

Burton's court is one of  91 courts and tribunals buildings across the country that are under threat of closure under the new proposals. 

The courts service claims that these courts are underused and Burton costs £200,000 a year to maintain, with a 52 per cent usage. 

However, protesters, including Burton MP Andrew Griffiths, believe the closure could be the end of local justice,   leading to victims, witnesses and defendants and their families travelling for more than an hour to attend another court.

1881,"The Queen will soon make history when she becomes the longest reigning British monarch - but on the day it will be business as usual for the head of state and her family. 

On Wednesday, she will pass the record set by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria who, Buckingham Palace has calculated, reigned for 23,226 days, 16 hours and 23 minutes. 

There has been speculation a celebratory private event is planned but it is understood that in keeping with the Queen's business-as-usual approach it will be a normal working day for the monarch with no special dinner party. 
 
At this time of year the Queen is taking her traditional summer break at her private Scottish home of Balmoral. 
 
But on the day she passes Victoria's milestone, the monarch, joined by the Duke of Edinburgh, will open the new Scottish Borders Railway and take a steam train ride on the new £294 million railway. 
 
Members of the Royal Family including the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall will also be working. 
 
Charles will be filming a documentary with TV presenters Ant and Dec, believed to be about his Prince's Trust organisation which celebrates its 40th anniversary next year, while Camilla will visit the ITV studios in London to celebrate the organisation's 60th anniversary. 
 
A royal source said: ""You need to remember for the Queen this is a date whose calculation rests on the death of her father and great-great-grandmother, that naturally colours the way she sees it. 
 
""While she acknowledges it as an historic moment, it's also for her not a moment she would personally celebrate, which is why she has been keen to convey business as usual, and no fuss."" 
   Promoted stories   
Historian Dr Kate Williams described the length of the Queen's reign as a great source of strength for the monarch. 
 
""It's a very significant milestone. The Queen will become the longest reigning British monarch in history. She came to the throne when she was older than Victoria. Victoria was only 18,"" Dr Williams said. 
 
""It shows that our female monarchs last the longest. The Queen's longevity is a great source of her strength and popularity. She has lived through World War Two and throughout the 20th century. Many people will not have known a different monarch."" 
 
Queen Victoria, who died in 1901, acceded to the throne on June 20 1837 and became the figurehead of a vast empire amid great industrial, cultural and scientific changes to society. 
 
But she mourned the early death of her consort Prince Albert in 1861 for the rest of her life. 
 
Princess Elizabeth became Queen Elizabeth II when she was 25 on the death of her father King George VI on February 6 1952. Like Victoria, she has acted as a figure of continuity as the country has modernised. 
 
She has served, with Philip at her side, through the 20th century and into the 21st century, witnessing technological advances and a succession of British governments of different political persuasions. 
 
The Queen has become accustomed to countless milestones during her decades on the throne. 
 
In December 2007, she became the longest living British monarch, overtaking Victoria who died when she was 81, and in May 2011 she became the second-longest reigning monarch in British history when she overtook George III. 
 
According to Guinness World Records, the Queen also holds the world record for most currencies featuring the same individual. 
 
The Queen is also the first British monarch to have sent an email, to have a message put on the moon, have conducted a royal ''walkabout'' and to have held a public concert in her back garden. 
 
She is the second-longest serving monarch in the world after King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand, who took to the throne in 1946 but who is now rarely seen in public. 
   
 Share article  
   
The record of length of time on the throne can be calculated in different ways, but the Palace considers the total number of days plus hours and minutes to be the most accurate. 
 
The Queen passes Victoria's record at around 5.30pm on Wednesday when she will have reigned for 23,226 days 16 hours and approximately 30 minutes - but the exact moment she became Queen is hard to calculate as George VI died in his sleep in the early hours of the morning, possibly at around 1am.",ecec4d75-d3ac-447d-ad39-f3132d7dd861,News,2015-09-06T02:26:44Z,Northern Echo,Queen to become longest reigning monarch with business-as-usual approach,0.0,News

1311,"MUMBAI: Union Minister for Minority Affairs Najma Heptulla has said that her ministry is working to achieve PM Modi’s vision of making India the skill capital of the world and making it a reality amongst the minorities. 
The first Education Minister of India, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad always considered education as the basis of human development and thus he wanted each and every citizen of India to get educated, she said. 
The minister was speaking at the closing ceremony of skill development training programme here last evening, by Maulana Azad National Academy For Skills (MANAS), organized for awarding certificates to the students and disburse loan to the candidates preferring self employment. 
Azad always emphasised on creating a uniform education system so that the intellectual class of the country will have a balanced thought and concern, she added. 
The PM today is concentrating more on skilling India according to modern requirements so that everybody is benefited, she said. 
Heptulla said Mumbai is the financial capital of the country and there is a trend of entrepreneurship and running one’s own business here. 
“Through MANAS, I would like to experience and prove that this trend of the city, can not only be implemented for the empowerment of Minorities, especially for women but will also open a new chapter in the history for the welfare of minorities in India. I am very happy to share with you that our efforts in Mumbai regarding empowering minorities have validated the results,” she said. 
This initiative of MANAS will give strength to PM’s Make in India effort. Based on the positive results of the skill development efforts in suburbs like Bhandup, Mumbra, Sakinaka, Kurla and Meera Road, minorities in other areas of Maharashtra such as Bhivandi, Nagpur, and Baramati, will be trained according to the local requirements of the region, she said. 
While reminding people about the PM’s vision of empowering minorities and that he would like to see all Muslim youth in India hold Quran in one hand and computer in the other, she said that this will empower them and enable them in getting education as well as employment. 
Skill development centre has been created in madarsas for the benefit of minorities and this is a positive step towards involving minorities into the PM’s skill India mission towards realising Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas agenda. 
Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who was also present assured the minorities that the government of Maharashtra will give full support and cooperation to the works done towards their welfare. (AGENCIES)

816,"I have a modicum of faith in films starring my beloved TV actors, mainly because I know their demanding schedules only allow them to devote but so much time to their theatrical endeavors. The Forest was a movie I was aware of but didn’t have much of an interest due to the premise seeming somewhat generic. If I remember correctly my exact thought was “It’s gonna take a lot of skill to get me to watch this”. Either I’m much more of a pushover than I thought or this film actually has some potential. Gramercy Pictures released a trailer today and I’m kinda intrigued but the hand I was dealt. Here, see for yourself: A supernatural thriller set in the legendary Aokigahara Forest at the base of Mt. Fuji in Japan. A young American woman, Sara  (Natalie Dormer of “Game of Thrones” and “The Hunger Games”), goes in search of her twin sister, who has mysteriously disappeared. Despite everyone’s warnings to “stay on the path,” Sara enters the forest determined to discover the truth about her sister’s fate – only to be confronted by the angry and tormented souls of the dead that prey on anyone who wanders into the forest. Now there are things that seem a little generic and you might write this one off without much thought if you’ve already seen films like The Cabin in the Woods but I’m a genuine Dormer Supporter. The Forest will release January 2016 so there’s still plenty of time to get a clearer picture on what’s in store.

3118,"Stone Energy confirmed layoffs occurred this week. (Photo: File photo) 

Layoffs this week at Stone Energy follow the company’s yearlong effort to manage resources carefully while oil and gas prices remain low globally. 

“We’ve seen this coming for a while,” Stone Energy President and CEO Dave Welch said Wednesday. “We started reducing last year.” 

Welch said employee rolls have dipped from about 400 to about 300 employees since late 2014, a number that includes retirements and natural attrition. He declined to say how many jobs were lost this week but said losses were felt around the company, which has sites in Lafayette, Houston, West Virginia, New Orleans and deepwater. 

In January, Stone Energy announced it was cutting its operating budget from $875 million in 2014 to $450 million this year. About three-quarters of its budget was allocated to Gulf of Mexico deepwater activity; 8 percent to Appalachia, primarily around West Virgina; 4 percent to business development and 13 percent to abandonment expenditures. The company's emphasis in deepwater and in Appalachia was because of lower operating expenses. 

Lease operating expenses were cut by some 40 percent, he said, administration by about 20. 

“When the price for your product drops in half, people are telling you they don’t need more of your profit,” he said. Some financial forecasters are predicting that prices will remain low through 2016, although Welch said that’s not certain. The careful choice for leadership, he said, is to keep expenses “lower for longer” within the company. 

Stone Energy strengths include two Gulf of Mexico sites that provide additional development opportunities. The company’s risks in the Gulf are lower and Stone Energy can “carry its product forward over the next few years,” he said. 

“We are hoping for a rebound, but we cannot plan on it,” he said. The intention going forward, he said, is to spend within the company’s profits. 

Stone Energy did not file Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notices of the layoffs with the state because layoffs were diffused and did not meet minimum benchmarks for WARN notices in Louisiana. 

Welch declined to name specific positions where layoffs occurred, but said since the workforce reductions have started, there have been one executive and six managers laid off. Other individual contributors who have lost their jobs include “highly trained and educated” people whose jobs were important to the company. 

Layoffs represent “the worst part of the job by far,” Welch said — for managers who make the announcements but especially for those who lose their jobs. 

“Sometimes these cycles come and we do what we have to do,” he said. Welch, who has served as president and CEO for 12 years, said recent downturns include those of 1999-2000; 2008, which he said was short term; and the current downturn. 

He said the company would continue community volunteering efforts, which include a high-profile cookout for United Way and work in the public schools. 

“Our people will continue to step up. It’s part of who we are,” he said.

5117,"Ron Roenicke, magic man? Well, no, but it certainly can’t be mere chance that the Dodgers’ newfound ability to run the bases happens to pretty much coincide with Roenicke’s arrival as their new third base coach.
Nor is it coincidence that it happened as Carl Crawford was coming off the disabled list and speedster Jose Peraza was called up from the minors. Yet there’s no denying the Dodgers have become a more aggressive team on the bases of late. Get news and notes on all the Dodgers matchups Open link In their last 12 games they’ve stolen 20 bases. They’ve been caught stealing once. No other team in baseball has more than 10 steals in that stretch.
It took them their 85 previous games to steal 20, and during that stretch they were caught stealing 14 times.
That is some kind of turnaround. Certainly the return of Crawford and the addition of Peraza were a major boost, but Justin Turner has three stolen bases in that run. Scott Van Slyke stole a base, Austin Barnes picked one up and so did Corey Seager. Scott Schebler stole two and Jimmy Rollins three. cComments Got something to say? Start the conversation and be the first to comment. Add a comment 0 Suddenly everyone wants in on the act. The Dodgers have gone 9-3 since discovering that they too can steal a base.
Baserunners on the move mean infielders are too. Gaps are created, infielders are not necessarily in a set position to retrieve a grounder. It just makes for a more aggressive team, one that can actually manufacture runs and not simply rely on a home run to produce offense.
The Dodgers’ struggles on the bases had been clear all season, though it came as a surprise that the front office brought in Roenicke on Aug. 17 to take over for Lorenzo Bundy as the third base coach.
But Roenicke, the former Brewers manager, had been third base coach for the Angels when they were running wild and capturing their only World Series in 2002. He knows how to direct an aggressive team on the bases.
And right now, unexpectedly, that’s what the Dodgers are.

2434,"New Delhi, Sept 22: There appears to be no solution in sight where the fate of the Karnataka  Lokayukta is concerned. Justice Bhaskar Rao, the Lokayukta has been on leave for the past two months and there have been allegations that he has not deputed his work to anyone else. 

Read more:  Does Karnataka Lokayukta have moral right to probe corruption? 

The Lokayukta's office is facing corruption charges and to add to it the son of Justice Rao has been accused of making extortion calls using his father's name. Former Lokayukta of Karnataka, Justice Santhosh Hegde says, ""enough is enough."" 



In this interview with OneIndia he says that the time has come to arrest the Lokyaukta for permitting his son to indulge in illegal activities. 

Is there any solution in sight? 

The Lokayukta's office is in disarray and Justice Rao is on leave for the past two months. 
It seems as though the people have gone quiet now. Yes the Lokayukta is on leave for the past two months and he has not deputed his work to anyone. Files are piling up and cases are pending. 

Do you think Justice Rao needs to be arrested? 
Yes, he should be arrested. Section 109 of the Indian Penal Code states that whoever abets a crime must be punished. I feel this should be made applicable here. I want to ask if Section 109 is applicable only to the poor? 

How has Justice Rao abeted the crime? 

Can he deny that he was not aware of what his son was doing? He allowed both his house and office to be misused. 

The investigation shows that call of the alleged extortion were made from the home number of the Lokayukta. Moreover why is on leave for the past 2 months? He himself has admitted that he had been misled. 

The Lokayukta is almost non-functional today. What are your views? 

He cannot think that the Lokayukta is only him, it is an institution. For a person who has been a Chief Justice of a High Court he should have handled this better. 

If you recall the High Court Bar Association had passed a resolution against his appointment as Lokayukta. 

What effect is the absence of the Lokayukta having on the institution? 

The Lokayukta of Karantaka today is in disarray. Files are accumulating and the pendency of cases has shot up. Basically the Lokayukta himself is not present. He is on extended leave and it appears he has not delegated the work to anyone else. 

This is leading to the pendency and files accumulating. Ideally the Upa-Lokayukta should have looked into these cases, but in the absence of any authorization cases are pending and work has come to a virtual standstill. I even get to hear that the administrative work has not been delegated. This is creating problems and also adding to the existing mess. It is a total breakdown and failure of the system. 

Do we need a Lokayukta at all? 
The intention should be to cure the defect and the problem. Shutting down an institution due to corruption allegations against a few is not the solution. Think about all those people who depend on the Lokayukta. That appears to be the problem. None are acting in the right direction. 

Another point I would like to make out here is that if there are rumours of corruption one needs to act immediately upon it by thoroughly investigating into the matter. Do not let issues prolong forever, it never does any good.

4149,"Linebacker Derrick Johnson hoped to arrive for the Chiefs’ “Monday Night Football” game against the Green Bay Packers as the team’s career leader in tackles. 

That didn’t happen, but Johnson said he wouldn’t force the issue. 

“In some games there are many opportunities, in other games there are less,” Johnson said before the game. “My main focus can’t be on that. I can’t worry about it.” 

But it didn’t take long for Johnson to match the record. It happened in the first half Monday with his fourth tackle. 

The record-breaker — career tackle No. 1,000 — came early in the third quarter, when Johnson was the first to reach James Starks, who went down after a 2-yard gain. 

Johnson entered the night with 995 career tackles. Gary Spani, the former Kansas State star who played spent his entire NFL career with the Chiefs, retired in 1986 with 999 career stops. 

Johnson recorded three tackles in the first quarter on a rainy night Lambeau Field, all of which came at the end of big gains and prevented even bigger plays. 

The tackle that tied the record was vintage Johnson. Late in the second quarter, he broke through, wrapped up Starks and dropped him for no gain on second and 1. 

The record was his, a year after he figured to break it. 

Last season, Johnson, coming off his third straight Pro Bowl season, was fewer than 20 tackles away from the record. He recorded four in the opener against Tennessee before disaster struck. 

A torn Achilles’ ended Johnson’s year. He spent the season and months after recovering and thinking about returning to action and picking up where he left off. 

In the season opener Sept. 13 at Houston, Johnson was on pace with eight stops. He wanted to break the mark in the home opener against the Broncos on Sept. 17, in a primetime spot before a national television audience. 

The game remained tight throughout the second half before the Broncos won it 31-24 on a fumble return in the final minute. 

“I looked up late and saw I didn’t have many tackles, and I knew it was going to be difficult to get (the record) that night,” Johnson said. 

He finished with two tackles against the Broncos. 

Johnson was the Chiefs’ first-round draft selection, 15th overall, in 2005 — the same draft that produced Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith at No. 1 with the 49ers and Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers at No. 24. Johnson started from the outset, but in 2009, he went to the bench, starting three times in 15 games. 

That season ended with perhaps the best game of his career, when he returned two interceptions for touchdowns in a victory at Denver. 

Starting in 2011, Johnson made three straight Pro Bowl appearances, and in 2011 was selected first-team All-Pro by The Associated Press. 

The honors now include a position among the best players in franchise history, at least statistically, although tackles are not an official NFL statistic. 

Tackle statistics are kept by the home team’s stats crew and, unlike interceptions or fumble recoveries, can be a judgment call and sometimes changed after film review by coaches. 

That happened on Monday. It appeared Johnson would be given an assist on a tackle early in the second quarter. But the Packers’ statistics crew didn’t credit him, and the chase continued. 

The Chiefs started keeping tackle stats in 1977, and they’re part of the team’s record book. Johnson holds the season record with 179 in 2011. 

He’d have loved to have arrived in Green Bay with the record. But there’s something he wanted more. 

“It would have been better if we had won the game,” Johnson said. “I could have zero tackles, and if we win, that’s what I want.”",f1d87be6-b47c-407f-8747-08bafe1fc600,News,2015-09-29T02:45:04Z,KansasCity.com,Derrick Johnson reaches top of Chiefs’ career tackle list,0.0,Blog
5987,"Logging in from multiple locations may be the cause.

Posted: Monday, September 14, 2015 11:43 pm Speaking personally, football season at UF is the most fascinating phenomenon I’ve ever witnessed. The campus transforms overnight into an entirely new atmosphere, complete with elaborate tailgates, massive tides of orange-and-blue-clad families and endless optimism. Everyone’s a little friendlier and anyone sporting Gator memorabilia is automatically a new friend. These Saturdays have an almost religious undertone as students, alumni and fans alike come together to invoke the holy name of Gator football.

I don’t get it.

This is my third football season at UF and I’ve never had season tickets. I’ve been to at most five games, and experienced maybe six hours of game time in total. I feel like I’ve truly given it the ol’ college try, but every time I get dragged to a game, it always ends up the same.

It all just seems so anticlimactic: the cheering, the music, the inescapable good mood — for what? How could 11 minutes of men chasing each other possibly deserve all this excitement? I’ve been waiting for it to click, for some revelation to hit me as I stand in getting progressively more sunburnt and looking down on the game. Everyone else seems to be having the time of their lives; I must be missing something.

I was raised by a football-loving family. I’ve sat through countless numbers of Pop Warner, high school and NFL games. My little brother is the first-string quarterback at my former high school, and no conversation with my family lasts 10 minutes without football coming up to some degree. To think that I’ve lasted 20 years without absorbing any of their enthusiasm or knowledge of the game is impressive, to say the least.

I’ve attempted to pretend I understand the sport, but it usually just ends up with me embarrassing myself. I tried this approach for the 2014 UF vs. Florida State University game and unknowingly cheered the Noles to victory the entire four hours. The enthusiasm was there, just not the competence.

It’s gotten to the point where I’ve become unapologetic of my distaste for football games. Of course I get the typical responses: ""But the games are such an important part of your college experience!"" or ""You’re going to look back and wish you went to more games!"" Honestly, if my only regret is that I should’ve watched grown men tackling each other more often, I think I’ll be OK. It’s a risk I’m willing to take.

Sure, it’s exciting to look around the stadium and see The Gator Nation all in one location, but it’s not the only place you can get those warm fuzzies. Grab some Krishna lunch and people-watch on the Plaza of the Americas. Look around at the people in your lecture hall. Do something philanthropic with your friends. Football is just one way to feel connected to this town, your fellow students and the UF community. The Gator Nation doesn’t cease to exist outside the stadium.

As for me, I’ll continue to celebrate game days like I always have, by reveling in the widespread good mood, drifting around campus with my friends, retreating to the comfort of my apartment and possibly checking the score every hour or so. At this point, I’m assuming I’ll never love or even understand football, and I’m OK with it. UF has so much more to offer than a single sport, and for that, I’m forever grateful.

2477,"Record numbers of people are dying from drug poisoning, new figures reveal. 
 
There was also a sharp jump in fatalities involving cocaine last year, while the number of deaths linked to anti-depressants was at its highest level for 15 years. 
 
Data published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show there were  3,346 drug poisoning deaths registered in England and Wales in 2014, the highest  since comparable records began in 1993. Two in three involved illegal drugs. 
 
The mortality rate from drug misuse was the highest ever recorded, at 39.9 deaths per million population.  Statisticians said the increase in mortality rate for all drug-related deaths for both men and women is likely to be related to the availability and consumption of heroin and morphine. 
 
Campaigners described the figures as ""tragic"", while public health officials said they showed an increase in availability and purity of heroin around the world is taking effect here. 
 
The figures cover accidents and suicides involving drug poisonings, as well as deaths from drug abuse and dependence. 
 
They indicate that drug-related fatalities are now concentrated among the middle aged.   For the first time the highest mortality rate from drug misuse is for people aged between 40 and 49. 
   Promoted stories   
The ONS report said the pattern is broadly in line with figures showing people receiving treatment for drug misuse are getting older. 
 
Deaths involving cocaine increased to 247 from 169 the previous year, an increase of almost 50%, with research suggesting an increase in purity has been a factor in the trend. 
 
There were 517 deaths involving anti-depressants in 2014, the highest number since 1999. 
 
Deaths involving heroin and/or morphine increased by almost two-thirds between 2012 and 2014, from 579 to 952, with increases seen across all age groups except people aged 70 and over between 2013 and 2014. 
 
The ONS highlighted evidence that suggests an increase in purity and volume of the substance following a ""heroin drought"" in 2010/11, while also citing cost as a possible factor. 
 
""Prices  of heroin have also changed over this period - the purity-adjusted price of heroin per gram in the  United Kingdom has fallen from £74.32 in 2011 to £49.55 in 2013,"" the report said. "" This means people can now take stronger heroin for the same price."" 
 
There were 67 deaths involving new psychoactive drugs (NPS) - sometimes referred to as ""legal highs"" - and a record 258 linked to diazepam, which is used to treat anxiety. 
 
Fifty fatalities involved ecstasy, following reports raising concerns about ""super strength"" versions of the party drug. 
 
The drug misuse mortality rate increased in England but fell in Wales. Regionally, it was highest in the North East, and lowest in London. 
 
Simon Antrobus, chief executive of substance misuse charity Addaction, said: "" These tragic figures paint a stark picture of the shifting landscape of drug misuse in England and Wales. 
 
""Drug treatment services across the country have seen an increase in the number of people seeking help for opiates and/or crack cocaine and this is only likely to increase further as the effect of increased opiate availability and purity is felt.""

7833,"#Yogi Berra Will not be Forgotten  By Howard Goldin
BRONX, NEW YORK (BRONX NEWS)- “It’s not over until it’s over.’” Unfortunately, the life of Yogi Berra is now over.
The beloved former baseball great passed away this week at the age of 90. Berra was born to an immigrant couple from Italy on May 12, 1925 in St. Louis, Missouri. He grew up in an Italian neighborhood, the Hill, in his native city. One of his childhood friends, Joe Garagiola, also reached the majors as a catcher, but was better known as an outstanding baseball broadcaster.
As a teenager, during World War II, Berra joined the U. S. Navy, he was assigned to a navy gunboat and took part in the D‐Day invasion on June 6, 1944. He earned several medals for his service including a Purple Heart and the distinguished Unit Citation.
In 1946, Berra became a member of the New York Yankees. His yearly success from 1946‐1963 earned him many honors. He was elected to 15 consecutive American League All‐Star teams, 1948‐1962. He was among the top four candidates for the American League MVP Award for seven straight seasons and the winner in 1951, 1954 and 1955.
In addition to earning individual honors, he was a major contributor to his team’s success. In 18 seasons with the Yankees, the club won the American League pennant 14 times. In 10 of those years, the Yankees were World Champions.
Although his offensive skills led him to a lifetime batting average of .285 and 358 home runs, Berra was an outstanding catcher. He is remembered as the catcher of Don Larsen when the latter through the only perfect game in a World Series. He also caught the two no hitters thrown by Allie Reynolds in 1951. On Yogi Berra day on July 18, 1999, Berra and Larsen and 42,000 fans witnessed the perfect game thrown by David Cone at Yankee Stadium.
The accomplishments of his playing career led to Berra’s election to the baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown in 1972, his second year of eligibility, and to the retirement of his and Bill Dickey’s #8. Not very well known is that Berra wore #38 in 1946 and #35 in 1947. Twelve years later, he and Dickey each had plaques in their honor placed in Monument Park at Yankee Stadium. Berra’s leadership qualities led to him being named a player/coach in 1963. The following year, 1964, he managed the yanks to the American League Championship.
In 1965, he travelled to Queens to be a player/coach although he only played in four games. He remained a coach with the Mets through 1971, and succeeded Hodges in 1972 after the latter’s untimely death. He took the Mets to the national League Championship in 1973 and managed them until the middle of the 1975 season.
The next year, Berra returned to the Yankees as coach from 1976‐1983. He succeeded and was succeeded by Billy Martin as Yankees manager from December 16, 1983‐April 28, 1985.
Berra’s innate decency, sense of humor and sparkling personality has made him a much admired individual in households where baseball is not even followed. This year, more than 100,000 persons signed a petition to qualify Berra for consideration to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom. A statement by Hal Steinbrenner, the Yankees Managing General Partner, represents the feelings of multitudes of people regarding Berra, “Yogi Berra’s legacy transcends baseball. Though slight in stature, he was a giant in the most significant ways through his service to his country, compassion for others and genuine enthusiasm for the game he loved. He has always been a role model and hero that America could look up to...His imprint in society stretches far beyond the walls of Yankee Stadium. He simply had a way of reaching and relating to people that was unmatched. That’s what made him such a national treasure.”
R.I.P. Yogi.

6149,"James Trading Group's Croker Kids Ireland hoodies have been recalled Drawstrings can get caught or entangled on playground slides or moving objects No incidents or injuries have been reported Customers can return hoodie for full refund     
About 1,200 hoodies for kids are being recalled because it has a drawstring around the neck that can cause a strangulation risk. 

No incidents or injuries have been reported, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said Friday. 
   
James Trading Group is recalling its Croker Kids Ireland hoodies (above) because of possible strangulation risk, even though no such incidents have been reported

They were sold in kids' sizes '2YR' through '12YR' stores and online at thejtg.com from November 2012 to August 2015. They cost about $20. 

Customers should take away the hoodies from children and remove the drawstring to eliminate the hazard, the CPSC said.

HOUSTON, TX -- (Marketwired) -- 09/10/15 -- Heritage Texas Properties (Heritage), the largest independently owned residential real estate firm in the Greater Houston region, names Chaille Ralph, last year's Chair of the Houston Association of Realtors®, as its new President. 

Mrs. Robin Mueck, owner and CEO of one of Houston's most recognized and honored real estate brokerages, becomes Chairman and CEO to lead the firm's business development and local community outreach efforts. Jerry Mueck, Executive Vice President and husband of Robin, is also an owner. 

""Our people are our greatest strength,"" says Mueck, ""and we now have in place a vibrant new management team -- led by an admired and proven leader, Chaille Ralph. Our leadership team has a shared vision to provide exciting new growth and innovation that will deliver even greater geographic reach, and inspired personal service to delight our clients."" 

 Heritage , which will celebrate its 40th Anniversary next year, has grown under Mueck's leadership from a few dozen agents in one office to 16 locations from the Gulf Coast to Central Texas, home to more than 300 licensed Realtors. It has been recognized as one of the top brokerage firms in the U.S. by REAL Trends. As a member of the prestigious Leading Real Estate Companies of the World and Luxury Portfolio, and a past recipient of its Most Innovative Brokerage Award, Heritage also is part of a global marketing network of 500+ real estate firms with 3,500 offices and 120,000 sales associates spanning 50 countries. This exclusive partnership allows Heritage to promote its properties to potential buyers all over the world. 

Ms. Ralph, a licensed real estate broker since 1982, has been with Heritage since 2009, most recently as Senior Vice President of Sales for the company's Post Oak, Downtown and Galveston locations. A respected industry leader, she serves as a Director of the National Association of Realtors, the Texas Association of Realtors and the Houston Association of Realtors. She's a native Houstonian, alumnae of St. Thomas Episcopal School, and graduated from Texas Christian University with a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration. 

Ms. Ralph will lead the day-to-day operations, heading the new leadership team for Heritage . In related moves, Sandy Benson, Senior Vice President, is now responsible for sales companywide, supporting top line growth and overseeing branch leaders. Kristen Abney, Senior Vice President, heads up the highly profitable relocation division as well as strategic initiatives and special projects. Senior Vice President Bill Jones has been selected to head up an exciting new venture that Heritage will reveal in the coming weeks. 
  
""This may be the most exciting time in our company's treasured journey,"" says Mrs. Mueck. ""I am honored and humbled to help Chaille and our management team write our next chapter of success. We are the company to watch."" Mrs. Mueck believes that her burgeoning enterprise will continue to expand, as it attracts the best talent from both the ""Next Gen"" and seasoned veterans. 

""While these innovative moves create an energy and excitement among the Heritage family that will help us grow and serve our clients better than ever,"" Mrs. Mueck adds, ""Our traditional values remain unchanged: We have built our culture around attracting people of integrity who genuinely care and have concern for our clients and each other, which is rare. We do it right. That won't change."" 

Mrs. Mueck, as Chairman and CEO, will be focusing on expanding Heritage market share throughout the communities it serves, both through business development and taking a more direct role in local community leadership activities throughout the Greater Houston Region. ""I'm thrilled to transition Chaille to lead the day-to-day operations to allow me to focus on exciting new growth initiatives and deepen our long-standing relationship with the community."" 

Mrs. Mueck notes that Ms. Ralph's appointment to President is the third major initiative Heritage has undertaken in recent months. In June, the company unveiled its new logo and brand identity. The effort, says VP of Marketing Jaclyn Reed who spearheaded the effort, was designed to ""visually align our brand with the modern company Heritage has become, yet underscore our long-standing image of quality, service and sophistication based on our tradition of excellence and integrity."" 

Second, Heritage is renovating its flagship Post Oak Park office, which reopens on October 1, 2015. ""It's a complete overhaul of the entire 12th floor of this Class A office building,"" Mrs. Mueck says, ""and it symbolizes our penchant for quality in everything we do."" 

With 360-degree sweeping views of the downtown Houston skyline, River Oaks, Uptown Park, the Galleria and 1,500-acre canopy of Memorial Park, Ralph, Mueck and the rest of the leadership team will have created a stellar environment for its agents, staff and clients. ""This expansion will enable increased marketing support,"" says Mrs. Mueck, including marketing for builders, development support, and personal branding for agents. ""Our flagship office paints a new picture of innovation and progress, still suitable for our established traditions,"" she adds. The location will be used for state-of-the-art corporate video production, video conferencing, and distance learning to support Heritage Texas Properties located throughout the state. 

 Heritage Texas Properties has a legacy of leadership that includes five former Chairs of the Houston Association of Realtors, with four still part of the Heritage Texas Properties team, including Mrs. Mueck, Ms. Ralph, Mr. Jones and Lynn Zarr, Sr.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Ride services Lyft and Uber have poached dozens of key Twitter Inc employees over the past year, including top engineering managers, to help personalize their apps. 
 
Twitter's management turmoil and 44 percent stock fall over the last 12 months have helped Lyft and Uber recruit key talent, as the micro-blogging site's employees look to recreate its early success elsewhere, tech recruiters said. 
 
At least 25 former Twitter employees have joined Uber since January 2014, according to a search by Reuters of LinkedIn, including top managers such as Raffi Krikorian, an engineering lead at Uber since March. 
 
Lyft has poached approximately 15 former Twitter employees, including senior managers and engineers such as Peter Morelli, now a key engineering manager at Lyft. 
 
That is an unusually large number of people leaving in a short time span, tech recruiters said. 
 
Ride-sharing companies are especially attractive because they aim to disrupt the transportation industry, much as Twitter disrupted communication, said Dave Carvajal, founder and CEO of Dave Partners, a tech recruiting firm. 
 
""Twitter is having harder times and there are only a few places in town that are larger companies that are going to go public. Lyft and Uber are some of the best of those places,"" added Mehul Patel, CEO of Hired, a tech recruiting firm. 
 
Twitter employees are especially valuable as they have data skills that help Lyft and Uber understand consumer behavior, critical for the ride services as they look to personalize customers' experiences with their apps. 
 
""These people are some of the brightest talent out there,"" Carvajal said. 
 
Recruiting has grown increasingly competitive in Silicon Valley as start-ups valued at more than $1 billion, including Lyft and Uber, ramp up hiring as they look to go public. 
 
Lyft's staff has grown more than 70 percent since the start of 2015, a spokeswoman told Reuters, but she declined to say how many employees it has. Uber has added nearly 1,000 employees over the past year, according to the company. The numbers do not include drivers, who the firms class as contractors rather than employees. 
 
Twitter did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Salesforce president Keith Block 
    
If you’ve been following Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, you’re probably familiar with his trash-talking  habits over his former employer Oracle. 
 
But when it comes out at Dreamforce, Salesforce’s massive, week-long customer conference, and involves Oracle’s VP-turned-Salesforce president Keith Block, it only adds extra mustard. 
 
“Keith has been going through a very dramatic transformation during his time at Salesforce,” Benioff quipped after someone asked why Block’s not wearing a tie at Dreamforce on Friday. “You can see him today wearing jeans, his sports coat, looking actually somewhat relaxed.” 
 
He continued, “We get these guys who get shot out of the Oracle cannon. They show up at Salesforce, ready to go, filled with a very deep PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder), and our job is to kind of shake them down.” 
 
    
Business Insider 
 
Salesforce President Keith Block speaking at Dreamforce 
    
Block was a bit of a controversial figure when he joined Salesforce over two years ago. He had left Oracle the year before joining Salesforce, after court documents revealed him saying nasty things about  then Oracle’s president and current co-CEO Mark Hurd, and Sun Microsystems, a company Oracle acquired for $7.3 billion under Hurd’s watch. 
 
Since hiring Block in 2013, Benioff has been all praise about his president. Last year, at a press event, he went as far as to say , “[Block's]  probably the best sales executive the enterprise software industry has ever seen.” 
 
In fact, Salesforce has seen nothing but growth since Block’s appointment. It’s been consistently beating earnings guidance, while hitting record-high share prices. Coincidentally, Oracle  has missed sales expectations in five of the past six quarters. 
 
There’s been some reports that Block’s arrival and his more rigorous sales culture has caused some long-time executives to leave Salesforce. But regardless, investors largely seem impressed with his results. 
 
“The kind of things that Salesforce is telgegraphing to the Wall Street community is that it’s broadening out it’s suite, it’s increasing deal sizes, it’s going after larger customers, and it’s revamped its whole sales structure — and in large part, it’s around the hiring of Keith Block of Oracle,” Deutsche Bank analyst Karl Keirstead told us in a previous interview.

Parker was the second overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft. He was playing well before tearing his left ACL in December, ending his rookie season after 25 games.

6634,"Photo Credit: Philippine Daily Inquirer    Lawsuit to force budget department to pay nurses the correct salary grade  Law entitles nurses to Salary Grade 15, but are paid under Salary Grade 11  Salary increase would mean much to nurses  
MANILA, Philippines – Accusing the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) of repeatedly turning a blind eye to their plight, a party-list group representing nurses has filed a lawsuit against the budget department to force it to pay the correct salary grade for those nurses employed by the government, ABS-CBN has  reported . 
 
In its petition before the Supreme Court, Ang Nars party-list noted how government nurses were supposed to be receiving pay equivalent to Salary Grade 15 as mandated by Section 32 of Republic Act (RA) 9173, otherwise known as the Philippine Nursing Act of 2002, yet were still being compensated under Salary Grade 11. 
 
In order to enhance the general welfare, commitment to service and professionalism of nurses, the minimum base pay of nurses working in the public health institutions shall not be lower than salary grade 15 prescribed under Republic Act No. 6758, otherwise known as the “Compensation and Classification Act of 1989,” reads Section 32. 
 
Under Salary Grade 15, nurses are entitled to a monthly salary of P24,887 and above. Under Salary Grade 11, they receive only P18,549. 
 
According to Ang Nars Rep. Leah Paquiz, the group was forced to seek the high tribunal’s help after their appeal was rejected by the DBM, the Department of Health (DOH), and the Department of Justice (DOJ). 
 
She said the DBM directive relegating nurses to Salary Grade 11 was illegal as it clearly runs counter to RA 9173. 
 
The additional P6,000 to P7,000 under Salary Grade 15 would definitely mean a lot to nurses as they could use it to pay for their food or children’s education, she said, and added that the least the government could do to recognize the hard work of its nursing workforce is to pay them the correct amount.",aa1dbcc6-6425-4d73-877f-572952f458e0,News,2015-09-08T16:49:39Z,Kicker Daily News,Ang Nars sues DBM before SC for ignoring gov’t nurses’ salary plight,0.0,Blog
5043,"With more and more professionals on the look-out for a new job opportunity in sales, it’s time to establish where in the country you’re most likely to land the role of your dreams. The UK recently reached its highest level of employment since records began some 45 years ago but it’s clear that some cities are performing better than others. Let’s take a look. Narrowing down the search Surprisingly, Edinburgh is the best city in the UK for growth in job vacancies – posting a staggering 79% more job adverts in April 2015 than at the same time last year. By comparison, London saw a growth rate of 42% with almost 22,500 jobs posted in April out of a nationwide total of 134,232 based in the English capital. Sales professionals looking for roles in and around Birmingham are also in for some good news as the city had the second highest growth rate; a 54% increase of 7,866 jobs being posted. Manchester and Liverpool each saw a 47% rise in job vacancies so there is plenty of hope there too. Competition gets fierce While it’s great to see so many more job vacancies available throughout the cities in the UK, sales professionals need to be prepared to fight for the role they want.

682,"Pierce Brosnan has said he may be over 60 but he can still throw a punch and he is not ready to retire from action just yet. 
 
The former James Bond star revealed he is planning a sequel to his 2014 film The November Man, in which he played an ex-CIA man who found himself pulled out of retirement for a special mission. 
 
Pierce said: “I’m 62 years of age and so you just have to be aware that unless you’re really physically fit you can damage yourself pretty fast in these pieces. So there will come a slower time, yes. 
 [embedded content] 
“I’m aware of my physicality as a man, as an actor and you can only do action movies for so long, and then it’s time to bow out gracefully and let younger men do it. 
 
“But I think I can still run, I can still throw a punch, it remains to be seen…” 
 
He added: “We are going to try and do a November Man 2. I got away with the last one and I think this next one, if everything goes to plan, will up the ante a little bit more, give it a bit of a sheen and just juice it up a little bit more.” 
 [embedded content] 
Pierce stars alongside Salma Hayek and Jessica Alba in new romantic comedy Lessons In Love, which also stars 72-year-old Malcolm McDowell as his father. 
 
The Mamma Mia! star said: “Malcolm was a kick in the pants! He’s actually as charming and reverent and naughty and as bold as the day he was born. He is a unique talent, from the landscape of thespians. I was very, very proud to work with him, that he wanted to work with me was an utter joy. 
 
“I did say, ‘Listen you’re too young to be my father, this is crazy! But I don’t care, if you want to do it, do it.’ And that’s what happened.”

2664,"TOKYO, Sept 25 Japan's government is considering
new steps to tighten regulations on coal-fired power stations,
but some experts said these would not be enough to help meet its
goals on curbing carbon emissions over the next couple of
decades. 

Tokyo is trying to manage the competing demands of cutting
greenhouse gas emissions while burning coal at record levels
after the Fukushima disaster decimated public trust in nuclear
power. 

Climate change is centre stage internationally ahead of U.N.
environmental talks in Paris later this year, with Japan's
government coming under fierce criticism from environmentalists
over its support for coal. 

The nation's industry ministry is discussing rules forcing
all new stations to have a thermal efficiency equivalent to at
least around 40-42 percent of levels seen in so-called
ultra-super-critical plants, which typically get the most energy
from coal through the most advanced technology available for
commercial use. That would hit the construction of small plants
with a capacity below 112,500 kilowatts, whose maximum
efficiency usually stands around 36 percent. 

At the same time, the environment ministry is considering
making all plants go through a costly assessment that takes
around four years before being built. Currently only larger
plants are subject to the process, with smaller facilities often
only requiring local government approval. 
 
""These measures may help reduce the number of small plants,
but they won't be enough for Japan to keep its emission goal,""
said Takeo Kikkawa, professor at Tokyo University of Science. 

The world's No.5 emitter of CO2 has watered down emissions
targets, but still has a goal to cut greenhouse emissions by 26
percent from 2013 levels by 2030. 
 
That is despite plans to construct 40 more coal stations in
the next decade, including over 10 small plants that are cheaper
to build, as the country opens up its retail electricity market
from next April, exposing 10 regional power monopolies to new
competition. 

Any new steps would come on top of a voluntary plan
announced in July by electricity providers to cut greenhouse
emissions by more than a third by 2030 compared with 2013. But
the environment minister has questioned the plan, demanding
more-detailed measures. 

Hiroshi Takahashi, professor at Tsuru University, said
broader steps were required to meet Japan's goals. 
 
""Japan will need to bring in some compulsory measures such
as a (higher) environment tax or emissions trading."" 

An industry ministry official said the sector's voluntary
plan would be ""effective"" in achieving emissions goals, while an
official from the environment ministry said it was considering
all possible measures to help Japan reach its targets. 

Meanwhile, industry ministry officials denied a report by
the Nikkei business daily this week saying that it was
considering limiting each utility to using coal-fired plants for
a maximum of half their thermal power generation.

1846,"The Washington Post’s Barry Svrluga has a deep, perfectly-timed dive into the Washington National’s disaster of a season. Not only is it a complete tick-tock of how the team fell apart, it features a number of quotes and anecdotes from inside the locker room, each one revealing that Matt Williams’s performance as manager was, somehow, even worse than you imagined. 
 
There’s a lot to be drawn from Svrluga’s story, so you should definitely go read the whole thing , but the biggest revelation is that nobody on the team seems to think much of Williams. 
 
Here’s one anonymous Nationals player talking about Williams’s various strategic missteps : 
  
   
“The first time he does something odd, you’re like, ‘All right, I see, I get it, I’m with you,’” one Nationals veteran said. “The next time you’re like, ‘Ooookay. All right. I’m trying to get it. Yeah.’ And then when it keeps happening, guys are watching him like, ‘Well, here comes this guy again.’” 
 
Not every manager needs to have Joe Maddon’s ability to inspire confidence in order to be successful, but I’m fairly certain that “Well, here comes this guy again,” is not a thing that many good managers have had said about them by their own players. 
 
It gets even worse! One of the things consistently brought up to Svrluga by the players he talked to is Williams’s apparent lack of interest in communicating with his players, a source of friction that eventually led to a blowup when Williams failed to inform Jayson Werth that he was going to be out of the lineup one day: 
 
According to individuals with direct knowledge of the situation, Werth hadn’t received such a message from Williams. This wasn’t the first time, and Werth wasn’t the first veteran to experience what players considered an oversight once, an egregious error beyond that. 

What might have been a minor blip in a successful season became a boiling point. Incensed, Werth ripped the lineup card off the wall, bellowing that it was going to change. Then, according to several people who were present, he confronted Williams — not just about whether he would play that day, but about what most of the clubhouse considered to be a chronic lack of communication with his players. Among the most jarring barbs, from Werth to Williams: “When exactly do you think you lost this team?” 
 
Referencing that same confrontation, another player had this to say about Williams: 
 
“He’s like the guy in his house who hears a sound, like someone breaking in,” one player said. “And his reaction isn’t to take care of the problem or investigate. It’s to put his head under the pillow and hope it goes away.” 
 
About a year ago, Matt Williams was voted the N.L. Manager of the Year. Since then, he’s presided over the stunning collapse of a team that should have been a lock for the playoffs and transformed himself into baseball’s version of Michael Scott. It’s just too bad we’ll never see what he had in store for next season, because this dude is definitely getting fired. (In fact, how has he not been?)

Six a.m. mass said in the cold, dark of winter with one little old lady dressed in black occupying the back row. Ringing the church bells for Mass and allowing the rope to carry you up 15 feet to the ceiling. Christmas High Mass at midnight with hundreds of parishioners and many altar servers. The doors to the church open late everyday so you could pray when it came on you. Dreading confession. Genuflecting as you walked passed the church doors, even if you were on the sidewalk outside. Intense three-day wakes for a dead relative, with prayers said over and over. Priests who were sometimes tough and drank too much, mostly Irish. Nuns who were tough and could play baseball in a habit. These are the memories of a child. Memories of a world that was hard but made sense, memories that make today’s world a nightmare which reinvents itself daily.

3130,"""Thou hast ascended on high, Thou hast led captivity captive: Thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell among them."" (Psalms 68:18) Now I know that we can not prove that it is so; besides the testimony of the Bible, all that we have is the testimony of the Holy Spirit that lives inside of each and everyone of us. But don't you think that the simple fact that there is so much opposition to the name of Jesus is proof enough? Any time that I get a chance to share about this, it gives me so much pleasure, because there is so much opposition against the name of Jesus Christ; there is just something about that name! Why do you think that is? We know who is behind it, and we know why; it is called jealousy, but of whom? Many think that he rebelled when he first learned of God's plan to make man; I think that there is something to that, because he really seems to have it out for us. I watched ""Cinderella"" last night, for the third time, and the evil stepmother reminded me of just how jealous the devil is of us, and just how hard he will try to stop us from becoming the Bride of Christ. We don't realize this enough in our daily walk, but we should always be on guard against his endless ways of causing us to take our eyes off Jesus. It's not enough to cause us to stumble; no, he wants us to not get up; he wants us to ""lay naked in a field, kicking about in our own blood."" I am reminded of a song by DA, it's called ""Safety Net"", and my favorite part in the song, is where it says, ""Shoot like a bullet till kingdom come."" I have always picture God having one of those black powder muskets, with His powder being the Holy Spirit, as He places us in His musket and fires us off; after we propel out across the land, by the power of His Spirit, we come to rest somewhere in a field, and He finds us, picks us up, and loads us in again. Don't you ever forget that your His child! He is not going to leave you laying there, because you matter to Him; no matter what the enemy might say, your a son of the KING...  ""Therefore I, a prisoner for serving the Lord, beg you to lead a life worthy of your calling, for you have been called by God. Always be humble and gentle. Be patient with each other, making allowance for each other's faults because of your love. Make every effort to keep yourselves united in the Spirit, binding yourselves together with peace. For there is one body and one Spirit, just as you have been called to one glorious hope for the future. There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father; who is over all and in all, and living through all. However; he has given each one of us a special gift through the generosity of Christ. That is why the Scriptures say, ""When he ascended to the heights, he led a crowd of captives and gave gifts to his people."" Notice that it says ""he ascended."" This clearly means that Christ descended to our lowly world. And the same one who descended is the one who ascended higher than the heavens, so that he might fill the entire universe with himself.""

4178,"Canada's main stock index fell broadly on Friday as mixed employment data provided little clarity for investors hoping to receive more guidance ahead of this month's central bank monetary policy meetings on both sides of the border.   
Job growth in the United States slowed in August, rising 173,000, while the unemployment rate dropped to a near 7-1/2-year low and wages accelerated. Canada unexpectedly added 12,000 new jobs last month, versus the expected decline of 4,500, but the country's unemployment rate hit 7 percent, a one-year high. 
 
""At the end of the day, when you look at the data release this morning, there isn't a clear answer and if there's one thing the market doesn't like, it's uncertainty,"" said Patrick Blais, senior portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management. 
 
""The market's just having trouble reading the timing of the (Federal Reserve's) rate increase. I think that's just throwing the market off. There's a little bit for everyone, but at the end of the day, no one's happy."" 
 
Blais said the odds of the Bank of Canada cutting rates have dropped heading into the meeting next week, but added that headwinds in Canada remained fairly strong, and that the improving trends were not sustainable. 
 
At 11:06 a.m. EDT, the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index <.GSPTSE> was down 119.1 points, or 0.88 percent, at 13,477.31. It weakened more than 1 percent earlier, to touch 13,445.72. Healthcare was the lone gainer among the index's 10 most significant sectors. 
 
The biggest drags on the index were Royal Bank of Canada  ( >> Royal Bank of Canada ) , which fell 1.7 percent to C$70.76, and Toronto-Dominion Bank  ( >> Toronto-Dominion Bank ) , which declined 1.6 percent to C$50.98. 
 
The hefty and influential financials retreated 1.4 percent, with seven of the top 10 losers all falling within the sector. 
 
Despite less volatility in crude prices on Friday, energy stocks were also performing poorly, slipping 0.8 percent. Canadian Natural Resources  ( >> Canadian Natural Resources Limited ) was down 2.9 percent at C$27.51. 
 
Materials, home to mining companies, gave up 1.2 percent.

2519,"Matching our deserts is such a fun way to enter into any party! In this second edition of our Cake & Cuts matching party series we are pairing miniature victory roll cakes (aka cinnamon rolls) with a victory roll hair style reminiscent of the 1940’s jubilee for classically fun fall style. Be the Betty of the brunch table with this simple match that boosts of golden hues and supreme style victory. First let’s start with the victory cinnamon rolls. These tasty little treats are one of my favorite sweets. I love cinnamon rolls because they are an acceptable form of birthday cake to eat everyday. Even for breakfast! A miniature version flecked with gold is a fabulous way to present sweets at any birthday, anniversary, shower, bakesale, or even a busy Monday morning. Victory Cinnamon Rolls To make these miniature victory rolls you will need: For the dough: 1 package (2-1/4 tsp) active dry yeast, 3/4 cup whole milk, warmed, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, 4 large eggs, 4-1/2 cups flour, plus more as needed, 1-1/2 tsp kosher salt, 6 tbsp unsalted butter, at room temperature, cut into chunks. For the caramel: 6 tbsp butter, melted, 1 cup firmly pack light brown sugar, 3 tbsp dark honey, pinch of salt, 1 cup coarsely chopped pecans. For the filling: 4 tbsp butter, at room temperature, 1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar, 1 tsp ground cinnamon. For the cream cheese icing: 2-1/2 oz cream cheese, softened, 3 tbsp milk, 1-1/2 cups powdered sugar, more if needed. Plus edible gold flakes. 1. Start by making the dough. In the bowl of a stand mixer, dissolve the yeast in the warm milk and let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. Add the granulated sugar, eggs, flour, and salt. Attach the dough hook and knead on low speed, adding a little more flour if needed, until all your ingredients come together. 2. Toss in the butter and continue to knead until the dough is smooth and springy, about 7 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl. 3. Form the dough into a ball, put it in the bowl, and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise at room temperature until it is doubled in size, 1-1/2 to 2 hours. 4. While the dough is rising butter the pans, using a cupcake pan will give you a perfect mini cinnamon roll. 5. Make the caramel by stirring together the melted butter, brown sugar, honey, salt, and pecans. Divide and spread the mixture in each pan.
6. Punch down the dough and dump onto a floured work surface. Cut the dough in half. Roll out each half into a rectangle about 10 by 15 inches. Position the rectangles vertically. 7. Fill the dough. Spread each rectangle with 2 tablespoons of the room temperature butter, then half of the brown sugar and half of the cinnamon. Take a pizza cutter or sharp knife and cut about 8 strips from each rectangle. 8. To make the center of each “victory roll” take one strip and starting at the end closest to you, loosely roll up the strip. Place the roll in the center of the pan. Coil two other strips around the center roll by joining the strip to the end of the previous one, until the cupcake pan is filled. 9. Cover the pans loosely with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm, draft-free spot until puffy, about 1 hour. 10. Preheat the oven to 350F. Bake until the victory rolls are golden brown, 12-18 minutes (watch for doneness sooner). 11. Let the cakes cool in the pans on a wire rack for 5 minutes. 12. While cakes are cooling, make the icing by whisking the cream cheese in a stand mixer until creamy. Add the milk and whisk until combined. Sift in the powdered sugar and whisk until smooth. Drizzle cream cheese icing over the top of each of the victory rolls adding small pieces of gold foil with tweezers as you go. Serve on golden plates and enjoy! Victory Roll Hair To make the matching victory roll hairstyle start with a clean head of wavy hair. 1. Take a 2 inch section from one side of the head (the best way to find a starting spot for this section is by lining it up with the outside eyebrow line). Back comb the section to add dramatic height to the hair. Spray 2. Take a smoothing comb and gently pull the section over the top front of the head smooth out the top while keeping the height underneath. 3. Use a curling iron to get a wide thick curl right at the end of this section and use a couple Bobbie pins to hold the curl into shape. Pair this fresh party look with pink lipstick for a nod to the perfect 40’s hostess in a completely modern way. Grab your sweet rolls and make a serious statement at brunch this week.

Crescent (United States) (AFP) | 20 September 2015 5:43 

Located in the middle of the country, far from any major fault lines, Oklahoma experienced 585 earthquakes of a magnitude of 3.0 or greater in 2014. That’s more than three times as many as the 180 which hit California last year. 
 
“It’s completely unprecedented,” said George Choy, a seismologist at the US Geological Survey. 
 
As of last month, Oklahoma has already experienced more than 600 quakes strong enough to rattle windows and rock cars. The biggest was a 4.5-magnitude quake that hit the small town of Crescent. 
 
Sandra Voskuhl, 76, grew up in the rural oil boomtown and said she has never felt the earth shake like it did on July 27. 
 
First came a thunderous boom. Then the red earth shook hard, Voskuhl said. 
 
“You heard it coming,” she said. “Everything shook.” 
 
She recalled screaming as framed pictures toppled over in her home. 
 
Then, when things got quiet, she drove over to the town’s Frontier Historical Museum to help clean up antique dishes that had crashed to the ground and shattered. 
 
“We need the oil for our workers and our economy,” she said. “But these earthquakes are a little scary.” 
 
– Could a ‘Big One’ hit? –

Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is the process of shooting water mixed with sand and chemicals deep into the earth to crack rock formations and bring up oil and natural gas trapped inside. 
 
The process has unlocked massive amounts of oil and gas in Oklahoma and other states over the past decade. 
 
But along with the oil and gas comes plenty of that brackish water, which is disposed of by injecting it into separate wells that are dug as deep as a mile (less than two kilometers) below ground. 
 
The unnatural addition of the water can change pressure along fault lines, causing slips that make the earth shake, said Choy of the US Geological Survey. 
 
There is debate among scientists over how large of a fault could be reawakened, and how hard that fault might shake. 
 
One camp believes Oklahoma won’t see bigger than a 4.0 to 5.0-magnitude earthquake, which would be enough to break windows and knock things off shelves. 
 
Others believe a 7.0-magnitude earthquake could come about, which would be strong enough to topple buildings. 
 
“What’s at risk is that when you put water into the ground, it’s never going to come back out. You’re putting it in places it has never been before,” Choy told AFP. 
 
“The bigger the volume, the greater the area will be affected. And we don’t know what the long-term effect will be.” 
 
– 4,500 injection wells – 
 
The pace at which earthquake activity has increased has rattled many in Oklahoma, who are also worried about groundwater contamination brought on by fracking. 
 
From 1975 to 2008, the state experienced anywhere from zero to three earthquakes a year which registered at 3.0 or higher. 
 
Then the numbers jumped: there were 20 in 2009, 35 in 2010, 64 in 2011, 35 in 2012, 109 in 2013 and 585 in 2014. 
 
“We are the only state where once this problem came up, we just kept going (with fracking),” said Johnson Bridgwater, the executive director of the Oklahoma chapter of the Sierra Club, a prominent environmental group. 
 
“We want public safety to come first, rather than treating this state as a giant lab.” 
 
The danger is particularly acute given that Oklahoma has such an enormous oil and gas industry, and its pipelines, refineries and storage facilities were not built to withstand constant quakes, Bridgwater said. 
 
Oklahoma has about 4,500 disposal wells, with about 3,200 operating on any given day. 
 
State Governor Mary Fallin, a pro-business Republican, was slow to accept the link between fracking and earthquakes. 
 
She took action earlier this year after the science became clear, spokesman Alex Weintz said. 
 
It appears that an area known as the Arbuckle rock formation is most vulnerable because of its “unique geological features,” he noted. 
 
State regulators are now scrutinizing the operations of disposal wells in that area to ensure they don’t go too deep or inject too much water. 
 
Some operators have been told to cut the amount of water they inject into their wells and the state has also stepped up its monitoring. 
 
Three wells were shut down on Friday after two quakes – a 3.5 and a 4.1 – struck near Cushing, which has one of the largest crude oil storage facilities in the world. 
 
“We are hopeful that the actions taken by the Corporation Commission will have a significant impact on seismicity, but the process is ongoing and we’ll continue to evaluate the results that we’re getting now and potential future actions,” Weintz told AFP. 
 
The Sierra Club insists that much more needs to be done and has called for a moratorium on wastewater injection wells in the 21 Oklahoma counties identified to be most at risk.

3519,"(CNN) -  
It can be argued that there are fewer things more New York than a slice, the subway and a rat. 
 
Combine the three, and it's magic. 

Behold Pizza Rat, the world's newest viral star and, for some, a symbol of the ultimate New Yorker. 

A YouTube video was uploaded of a rat attempting to carry a slice of pizza down some subway stairs in the Big Apple. 

No matter that the slice is way bigger than Pizza Rat and at any minute the rodent could be squashed by scampering humans who are also just trying to get to their destination. Pizza Rat was on a mission. 

""He appears poised to complete the descent and return to his squalid rat hole with his unnecessarily large prize -- an inspiring demonstration of the grit and determination one needs to make it in New York City,"" Caroline Bankoff wrote for the Daily Intelligencer. 

Suddenly, Pizza Rat was being hailed as ""Carrie Ratshaw"" (a nod to the ""Sex and the City"" character) and an all-around winner at life. There's even a quiz that can determine whether you are Pizza Rat. 

The Internet, of course, has been all embracing it, with ""Watch What Happens Live"" host Andy Cohen speaking for us all when he tweeted simply ""obsessed with #PizzaRat."" 

Naturally, there is already a New York Pizza Rat Twitter account, which offers a simple explanation for the trek: ""Wasn't trying to make a statement, humans. Just trying to get some damn pizza down some subway stairs.""

Toronto said Tulowitzki will be monitored for the next week for the Blue Jays to determine a timetable for his return. The Blue Jays said he will speak about the injury Sunday. Tulowitzki backpedaled into short center to catch Didi Gregorius' popup with two outs. After Tulowitzki caught the ball, he was hit from behind by Pillar. Tulowitzki at first held the ball and transferred it to his right hand as he collided with Pillar, then seemed to be stunned and fell to the field as the ball rolled out of his hand. Tulowitzki was attended to by a trainer and walked off on his own Saturday, although with a limp. After saying X-rays of his rib and chest were negative, the Blue Jays said he would have an MRI.

With Jay Cutler expected to miss at least two weeks with a hamstring injury, the Bears promoted quarterback David Fales from the practice squad Tuesday. Fales spent much of last year on the practice squad, too, before being promoted late in the season. The Bears drafted Fales in the sixth round in 2014. Cutler was injured while trying to make a tackle on a Tony Jefferson interception return last Sunday vs. the Cardinals, leaving Jimmy Clausen as the starter for now and making the promotion of Fales the logical next move. Cornerback Bryce Callahan was waived to make room for Fales. The Bears also announced a series of other practice squad moves, signing cornerback Demontre Hurst and wide receiver Deontre Thompson and releasing wide receiver Emugedi Umodu from the practice squad.",3416624a-ba0f-4ecd-ae09-b43c1185b97e,Blog,2015-09-23T00:25:11Z,ProFootballTalk,"With Cutler down, Bears promote Fales to active roster",1.0,News

Labor has promised another $3.2 million in funding to tackle crime and domestic violence in the Canning electorate as it continues its by-election campaign. 

Speaking at a drug and alcohol support centre in Armadale on Thursday, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said community safety and security was a key issue in Canning. 

Labor candidate Matt Keogh said people were particularly concerned about the effect the drug ice was having on those in the area. 

If elected in 2016, Labor would give $2.7 million in funding to Palmerston Association and Hope Community Services over the years to 2019. 

Labor would also spend $200,000 on CCTV in Armadale and Mandurah and $200,000 on the Peel Community Legal Service. 

The latest funding announcement comes after Labor pledged last week to support the state opposition's push to make Armadale police station open 24/7 to the public.

4828,"This is a newly revised + expanded guest blog from our OSSTF Activist readers:
Why it may be worth “gambling” on a NO vote:
It means agreeing to a continued decline in our real incomes!!! The Memorandum of Settlement is not a net gain as would appear on first glance.  Consider the following realities of accepting the proposed contract: The “lump sum” of 1% during the 2015-2016 does not work to increase our base salary.  In effect, our salaries are s for another year. That set-back will be compounded for the remainder of our respective careers (i.e. we lose that 1% for each year following the 2015-2016 year). In 2012 our salaries were frozen for three years – that set-back is already “in the mix”.  In comparing our salary to the Cost of Living Increases since 2012, and an estimated yearly increase of 1.6% over the duration of the proposed contract we will observe significant gross losses in salary. (See Calculation Summary below) If we account for the cost of living over the 5 years (2012 - 2017) we will have worked ¼ of a year for free!!
THAT IS EQUIVALENT TO A HALF SEMESTER FOR FREE! Here are two examples of a teacher on the salary grid: “Level 3” Teacher who started working in 2003 School Year Gross Earnings (incl. delayed grid movement) Contract Gain % CPI % Salary with  grid movement and indexed to CPI Difference Total Loss 2011-12 $80, 256 We’ll use this salary as our base value of the last negotiated salary. 2012-13 $81, 641 0 1.5% $85, 111 $3, 470 $3, 470 2013-14 $85, 651 0 1.2% $89, 826 $4, 175 $7, 645 2014-15 $87, 449 0 2% $91, 622 $4, 173 $11, 818 2015-16 $88, 323 0 + 1% Lump 1.6%* $92, 539 $4, 215 $16, 033 2016-17 $88, 544 1% + 0.5% on 98th day 1.6%* $94, 019 $5, 475 $21, 508 * Estimates based on the average of the CPI% from previous three years. “Level 4” Teacher who started working in 2005 School Year Gross Earnings (incl. delayed grid movement) Contract Gain % CPI % Salary with  grid movement and indexed to CPI Difference Total Loss 2011-12 $76, 600 We’ll use this salary as our base value of the last negotiated salary. 2012-13 $78, 063 0 1.5% $81, 460 $3, 397 $3, 397 2013-14 $82, 055 0 1.2% $86, 132 $4, 078 $7, 475 2014-15 $85, 861 0 2% $91, 622 $5, 971 $13, 446 2015-16 $90, 140 0 + 1% Lump 1.6%* $96, 345 $6, 205 $19, 651 2016-17 $94, 007 1% + 0.5% on 98th day 1.6%* $101, 753 $7, 746 $27, 397 * Estimates based on the average of the CPI% from previous three years. It fails the fairness test:
Teachers have been told that wage increases for us would be unjust to taxpayers.
Given that real incomes are rising across the province, and are expected to continue to do so, this austerity-based reasoning questionable.
We have already paid through a 5% decline in our real incomes between 2012 and 2014.  Under the proposed contract, the total decline in our real salaries (2012 and 2017) would, in all likelihood, exceed 10%.
If we continue to bear the financial burden, through decreasing real wages, the Provincial Government has little incentive to resolve its cash flow problem in other ways.
Agreeing to this deal sends some troubling messages about what we think is OK: Shocking us with blatantly unacceptable demands (and then removing them) works, because we are so shocked that we will then accept anything. It is OK for the Province to arrive at the bargaining table empty handed. The enforced contract strips from 2012 will become permanent. There is a viable alternative: The negotiation process is equipped to cope with the rejection of a tentative deal. When negotiation recommenced, OSSTF would return with a mandate to raise the bar.
Suggested Contractual/Bargaining Position(s) in terms of Compensation:      Immediate Lump Sum to off-set the freeze since 2012.          A provision of a cost of living adjustment as the minimum salary adjustment.  (See the accompanying Excel file to track other examples, noting that the calculations do not adjust  for movement across grid levels or leaves of absence.) [Ed: Most regretfully, Excel documents are not  compatible with my blog program. Ditto embedded charts and varied indentation features. In solidarity! David C]

5059,"A blood test for healthy ageing has been developed that could identify people who are growing old too fast and at risk of dementia. 
 
The genetic test is the first to provide an objective measurement of biological age and can provide an early warning of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia years in advance. 
 
Scientists analysed thousands of blood, brain and muscle samples to find 150 markers of gene activity associated with good health at the age of 65. 
 
These were used to produce a score-based rating system for healthy ageing that could be incorporated into a blood test. 
 
When a group of more than 700 healthy 70-year-olds were given the test they were found to have widely ranging healthy ageing scores that varied by up to four times. 
 
In particular higher scores were associated with better mental ability, kidney function and longevity over a period of 12 years while low scores were linked to Alzheimer's. 
 
Lead researcher Professor James Timmons, from King's College London, said: ""We use birth year, or chronological age, to judge everything from insurance premiums to whether you get a medical procedure or not. Most people accept that all 60-year-olds are not the same, but there has been no reliable test for underlying 'biological age'. 
 
""Our discovery provides the first robust molecular 'signature' of biological age in humans and should be able to transform the way that 'age' is used to make medical decisions. This includes identifying those more likely to be at risk of Alzheimer's, as catching those at 'early' risk is key to evaluating potential treatments."" 
 
The test involves looking at RNA associated with genes in different body tissues. The RNA acts as a ""messenger"" that carries genetic instructions to protein-making machinery in cells. It can be used to measure levels of gene activity. 
   Promoted stories   
Study participants' scores were found to correlate strongly with long-term health over two decades, said the scientists writing in the journal Genome Biology. 
 
Individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease were found to have an altered RNA signature in their blood and a lower healthy age score. 
 
Prof Timmons said: ""This is the first blood test of its kind that has shown that the same set of molecules are regulated in both the blood and the brain regions associated with dementia, and it can help contribute to a dementia diagnosis. This also provides strong evidence that dementia in humans could be called a type of 'accelerated ageing' or 'failure to activate the healthy ageing programme'."" 
 
The ""healthy age score"" could help identify middle-aged individuals suitable for clinical trials of preventative Alzheimer's treatments, said the researchers. 
 
Scores were not found to correlate with common lifestyle-associated conditions such as heart disease and diabetes. 
 
Dr Eric Karran, lead scientist at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: "" One of the biggest questions in human biology is how we age, and how this process impacts our wider health and risk for conditions like Alzheimer's. This study suggests a way to measure a person's 'biological age' and could reveal insights into the ageing process and why some people are more susceptible to age-related health conditions."" 
 
Dr Doug Brown, research director at Alzheimer's Society, said: ""Previous studies have identified sets of markers in the blood of people with Alzheimer's, but they have not yet been accurate enough to be used regularly in research or in the clinic. This study takes a novel approach, using healthy older people to identify a pattern of 'healthy ageing' markers and then showing that people with Alzheimer's deviate from this pattern. 
 
""People shouldn't take these findings to mean that most cases of Alzheimer's are inherited as this is not true. The markers identified in this study are affected by the complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors and we'll need further research to fully understand what they are telling us about the disease process.""

1501,"An employee is suing a Plano-based business, alleging it failed to provide her and other employees with a minimum wage and overtime pay. 

Beth Degrassi, individually and on behalf of all others similarity situated, filed a lawsuit Aug. 24 in the Sherman Division of the Eastern District of Texas against Nicka & Associates Inc. of Plano, alleging violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act. 

According to the complaint, Degrassi worked for the defendant as medical coder for three years prior to the lawsuit. Although the FLSA mandates employees be paid a minimum wage, the suit states Degrassi and other medical coders were or are paid based on the number of files/cases they entered into the defendant's technology system. The plaintiff contends the production rate pay doesn't amount to what they would be paid under a minimum wage. 

The plaintiff also alleges she and other medical coders didn't receive overtime compensation when working more than 40 hours in a given week. She says the defendant's actions were done intentionally and willfully. 

Degrassi seeks unpaid minimum wages and overtime compensation, liquidated damages, attorney fees and court costs, and other relief deemed appropriate by the court. She is represented by attorney Chris R. Miltenberger of The Law Office of Chris R. Miltenberger in Southlake.

1089,"Pranks may be for giggles. But gay rights -- not so much, Elton John says. 
 
The pop star responded to a prank by a Russian TV celebrity who called him this week pretending to be President Vladimir Putin. 

""Pranks are funny. Homophobia, however is never funny,"" he said in a post Thursday. ""I love Russia and my offer to talk to President Putin about LGBT rights still stands."" 

The call 

During the prank call, the singer apparently thought he was chatting about gay rights with the Russian leader. 

Russian state television broadcast excerpts from the phone call Wednesday night. 

""Hello Sir Elton,"" a man claiming to be Putin says in the recording. ""I was told that you wanted to discuss important problems of Russian reality."" 

John purportedly responds that he's eager to meet in person. He later posted an Instagram message thanking Putin for the call. 

Man admits to prank 

A Russian TV personality known for his pranks later said he made the call -- not the Kremlin. 

Russian celebrity prankster Vladimir Krasnov described how he and his comedy sidekick pranked the British singer, playing the roles of Putin and a press secretary during the call. 

'Happy to be pranked' 

John said while the pair can brag about the gotcha moment, he is proud to be pranked if it sheds light on gay rights. 

""If this unfortunate incident has helped push this vital issue back into the spotlight, then I am happy to be pranked on this occasion,"" he said. 

While Putin's office has insisted it had no conversation with the pop star, it told state-run Sputnik News he would be open to meeting with John. 

Human rights groups have criticized a Russian law passed two years ago that forbids discussion of gay issues near children. 

The prank came after John told the BBC that he'd like to meet Putin to discuss gay rights in Russia.",b4cdb6a8-390f-4621-bd6f-0d2f9b5d41d3,News,2015-09-18T09:48:20Z,WYFF4.com,Elton John 'happy to be pranked' for gay rights,0.0,News
3778,"The Roxby Miners made a clean sweep of the Roxby Downs Netball Association senior grand finals on Friday night. 
Locals flocked to the courts in their team colours to witness the A, B and C grade games. 
The tension was high and emotions were close to boiling point as players and spectators prepared for the first whistle. 
Opening the night was East Roxby B grade against Roxby Miners in a highly anticipated rematch of this year’s semi-final game.  
After the Miners’ disappointing loss in the semi-finals, they took the court with renewed vigour and determination.  
In a surprising move Miners coach Tony Weir elected to retain B grade Best and Fairest Renee Wurfel on the bench for the first quarter.  
This sent trembled whispers throughout the stands as many wondered at Weir’s game plan.  
The Miners took the first centre pass, resulting in the first goal to steady their nerves, with Emma Neilson leading the charge.  
East Roxby’s Jess Hassett and Karen Wegner did not let this rattle their calm and worked hard in the goal ring to gain momentum and keep within three goals of the Miners’ lead at the first quarter break, 13-10.  
The second quarter saw Wurfel take the court in a flurry of action, creating an immediate impact on the game.  
Spectators held their breaths when Miners goal defence Mikayla Davis went down with an injury and had to be assisted from the court in the second quarter and was unable to return.  
Centres Holly Mortimer (Miners) and Demmy Orr (East Roxby) fought hard for the ball and created turnovers. Their battle continued throughout the game, with both players providing an engaging display.  
At half time the Miners had found their stride and took a 10-goal lead, 28-18.  
The third quarter saw the Roos gain ground, scoring 12 goals to the Miners’ 10, however this failed to curb their opponents’ 38-30 lead.  
The supporters in their red and white, along with the sea of blue and white, voiced their encouragement in the fourth nail-biting quarter, with the Miners maintaining their lead into the final whistle, 49-39. 
Wurfel received the Best on Court award as part of her team’s first B grade premiership since 2011.  
The crowd of red and white moved over to support the C grade interclub clash between Roxby Miners Red and the young guns, Roxby Miners White.  

Both teams came out strong in a tense and nerve-wracking first quarter, with Miners Red taking the first three goals as defenders Amy Turley and Laura Johnson worked hard to keep Miners White’s shooters at bay.  
Miners White took a one-goal lead heading into the first break, 10-9.  
Mid-court pocket rockets Millie Young and Matilda Cordy were hard and fast when working the ball down the court and feeding into the goal ring.  
Miners White increased its lead to eight goals at half time, 26-18.  
The side came out renewed and revitalised after the break, while Miners Red appeared to be pushing to keep up. 
Dynamic duo Hayley Wurfel and Miranda Syvertsen (Miners White) worked the Miners Red defenders hard with their fast pace and scoring accuracy.  
The third quarter saw Miners White start to pull away on the score board as players worked to increase their lead to 17 goals, 43-26.  
It was a disappointing and bitter-sweet ending for Miners Red as Miners White took out the game by 19 goals, 55-36.  
Continuing the trend, another Wurfel won Best on Court. 
The final match of the night saw the highly anticipated A grade clash between reigning champions Roxby Miners and the underdogs, the Hornridge Magpies, who until the last games of the season were without a set team.  
The first quarter was goal for goal, with both sides unable to get the upper hand. 
Centre passes tended to generate a goal for the corresponding team, and Hornridge was able to keep the Miners’ mid-court from dominating. 
The first quarter break saw the Miners gain a one-goal lead, 16-15, and the crowd’s excitement built at the possibility of an upset.  
However, the Magpies were unable to maintain the intense pressure of the first quarter and the Miners began to forge ahead, with defenders Hannah Wurfel and Georgia Mandemaker blocking opportunities for Hornridge goalies Jemma Howe and Amanda Giles.  
The score line going into half time saw the Miners up by six goals, 32-26, with Hornridge still in the game.  
In the third quarter Kelsey Hampel (Miners) dominated the mid-court as centre, pushing her counterpart Georgia Sleep hard, creating turnovers and disrupting the Magpies’ line of play.  
The tension and emotive atmosphere of the third quarter saw the umpires further resorting to the whistle as players fought hard for control of the ball.  
Hornridge goal keeper Fiona Hooper had an uphill battle against Miners powerhouse Joice Takaidza, though she did create some outstanding turnovers.  
The Miners had a 13-goal lead by the end of the final break, 47-34.  
In the final quarter, the Miners changed player positions with Elly Anderson moving into goal defence, Hannah Wurfel into centre and Kelsey Hampel on wing defence.  
The Miners’ fitness and agility allowed them to increase the pace of the game to move the ball quickly down the court and push Hornridge hard.  
In the final throes of the game, Takaidza left the court to allow Erika Syvertsen a run in the goals for the last few minutes.  
The final whistle saw the Miners take the 2015 premiership by 21 goals, 65-44.  
Completing a clean sweep for her family, Best on Court went to Hannah Wurfel.  ",a3475df7-08d4-4932-955a-fb95b166c7ad,News,2015-09-08T19:37:03Z,Roxby Downs Monitor,Miners’ clean sweep,0.0,News

4145,"WASHINGTON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday expressed concern over reports that 100 mostly Muslim candidates in Myanmar's Nov. 8 general election have been disqualified and called on the authorities in the Southeast Asian country to address its concerns.

State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement about half of the candidates were rejected based on questions about their citizenship.

""The move to disqualify some 100 candidates, through an opaque and discriminatory process, risks undermining the confidence of the Burmese people and the international community in these elections,"" Kirby said.

""We urge the Burmese authorities to redouble their efforts to address these concerns and ensure that the upcoming elections constitute a step forward for the country,"" he added.

The November poll will be Myanmar's first since military rules ended in 2011. Washington has said it is important for continued U.S. support that the election marks progress in the country's fledgling democracy.

2077,"CHANDLER, Ariz. , Sept. 29, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --Microchip Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MCHP), a leading provider of microcontroller, mixed-signal, analog and Flash-IP solutions, today announced that its MOST50 Intelligent network Interface Controllers (INICs) are powering the infotainment systems of the new Toyota Vellfire executive-lounge vehicles. This is the latest deployment among a wide variety of the Toyota Motor Corporation's brands, which have been using MOST50 in their infotainment systems for more than a decade, including both volume and luxury vehicles. In the new Vellfire implementation, Toyota is once again using MOST technology to ensure high-quality digital audio throughout the vehicle. 
  
To learn more about Microchip's MOST networking products, visit http://www.microchip.com/MOST-092915a . 
 
To date, more than 170 million MOST devices have been installed in 191 car models since 2001. Toyota and all major carmakers have for many years successfully implemented MOST technology in their multi-node infotainment networking systems, as it provides a field-proven, low-risk, whole-system solution. Toyota's networks utilize Microchip's MOST50 INICs, which feature an Electrical Physical Layer (ePHY) that is optimized for use with Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) copper wire. The result is a system that can predictably and efficiently transport video, audio, packet and control data throughout the vehicle without time-synchronization protocols, using dedicated channels for minimal processor overhead in the main infotainment control unit processors. The remote-connection-management and remote-control capabilities of all MOST INICs enable further options, including the ability to build slim (processor-less) network nodes. MOST INICs also provide industry-standard hardware interfaces to processor and peripheral devices for the efficient routing of audio, video and packet data, which greatly simplifies module designs. End users can immediately access the vehicle's infotainment system, due to the MOST INIC's ultra-fast network startup feature. 

 
""The Toyota Vellfire emphasizes strength and luxury, and uses our MOST50 technology in its infotainment system to provide high-quality digital audio,"" said Dan Termer, vice president of Microchip's Automotive Information Systems Division. ""Toyota has been using MOST technology for more than a decade, and Vellfire is the latest entrant into the market. MOST provides a flexible platform to develop feature-rich infotainment systems."" 
 
The MOST Cooperation standards enable automotive OEMs and their Tier 1 suppliers with a proven and well-supported methodology for defining and implementing high-bandwidth infotainment and Advanced Driver Assistance (ADAS) systems, including a standard physical layer and a robust method for system management and control with superior reliability and Quality of Service (QoS). Using MOST technology also results in reduced weight for easier compliance with environmental regulations.

26,"The leader of Iran's legislature has definite views on his country's nuclear deal with world powers. 

Ali Larijani says the agreement is good enough. He adds that United States' reading of that deal, particularly when it comes to sanctions, is not good at all. And he's hoping that the agreement brings change in his country — though not as much as many Iranians would want. 

The lawmaker expressed those views to NPR during a visit to New York. While he is not one of the clerics who hold ultimate power in Iran, he is a consummate insider. He was a top national security official before his election to parliament. His brother leads the judiciary, and the family has important business interests. He is considered a true conservative in his country, and his views open a window into Iran's complex governing elite. 

Larijani supported the negotiations that led to the agreement, which places limits on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of global economic sanctions. He called the final terms ""acceptable."" 

""I believe that we can use this deal as a step we can take to move forward. And at the same time, it is not flawless,"" he said. 

Indeed, Larijani expects lawmakers in Iran's sometimes contentious assembly to complain. 

Critics In The Iranian Legislature  

The assembly speaker met with NPR at a New York hotel. He was dressed in a suit and no tie, in the style of the Islamic Republic. He's in his 50s, old enough to recall all the years from the 1979 Islamic revolution to this historic moment. 

He has held positions in the revolutionary government since its early years. He now leads a legislature that, like Larijani himself, is considered conservative. He says many lawmakers are skeptical of the deal. 

He pointed to provisions he considered unequal. The U.S., for example, can make sanctions snap back into place if it thinks Iran breaks the deal. 

""But that is not true for us. We cannot return to the situation that we were in the past,"" he said. 

Larijani sees many of Iran's concessions — like removing the core of a reactor – as permanent. 

His concerns are the opposite of those voiced by American critics. U.S. skeptics worry Iran is temporarily setting back its nuclear program to get out of sanctions forever; Iranians argue they're setting back their program for sanctions relief that may be temporary. 

Larijani's anxiety was evident in our conversation. ""If something ... happens in the U.S. Congress, or if there are new types of sanctions on us, then they should not expect us to go — to implement. Or if the Americans don't stay true to their obligations on their part, they shouldn't expect us to do it."" 

His remark pointed to one of the sticky points in this agreement. 

It's designed to lift nuclear sanctions against Iran. 

The U.S. says it offers Iran no assurances about sanctions imposed for non-nuclear issues. 

U.S. Says Sanctions Remain An Option  

The United States has insisted it will keep up the pressure against Iran on other issues. 

In an NPR interview in August, President Obama underlined this point:""We'll still have our sanctions in place with respect to non-nuclear activities like sponsorship of terrorism or violation of human rights."" 

That matches what Secretary of State John Kerry told NPR shortly after negotiating the deal. He said the U.S. was, ""absolutely"" free to punish Iran for acts like supporting the militant group Hezbollah. 

So how would Iran respond if the U.S. imposes new sanctions, or reimposes old sanctions, for issues other than nuclear issues? 

Larijani suggested that could lead to trouble. 

""There are different points mentioned in the text that need to be read carefully,"" he said. ""The text said that no country will go after new sanctions."" 

If Iran views the other side as violating the deal, ""we will respond accordingly."" 

The two sides may agree on what the nuclear deal says on paper. But arguments loom over what it really means in practice. 

""I think there are some people who want to wreck the deal, so they are trying to find new ways to make holes or to perforate the deal, but we are not going to do this,"" Larijani said. But, he added, ""if anybody wrecks the deal in any way, then we will know how to respond to it."" 

Will Reforms Follow?  

Larijani's answer to one question was particularly revealing, both in what he said and what he did not say. 

This was the question: Is there a specific economic, political, or social reform that is likely to become reality now? After all, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has indicated that he would like reforms inside Iran to follow a nuclear deal. 

""I think he meant, mostly he meant, economic reforms,"" Larijani answered. ""So, I see very much eye-to-eye with him in this matter,"" Larijani said. ""I think we can make it possible for the economy to thrive."" 

He dismissed questions about political or social reforms. He said nothing of easing Iran's constraints on personal freedom, or the media, or the Internet. He argued instead that Iranian society is more free than that of its neighbors. 

Asked if Iran might now free political candidates who've been under house arrest since a disputed election in 2009, Larijani said only that it was up to the justice system. 

Asked if Iran might free several imprisoned Americans, such as the journalist Jason Rezaian , Larijani suggested that the United States should trade Iranian prisoners for them. 

A Way To Move Forward  

Larijani cautioned that the nuclear deal alone might not transform Iran's relations with the West. ""Iran and the U.S. have this past history that is very dark,"" he said. 

Larijani recited the Iranian view of that history. He didn't mention moments on Americans' minds, like the 1979 hostage crisis, or Iran's calls to eliminate Israel, or Iran's past secret nuclear activities. He talked instead of 1953, when the U.S. supported a coup in Iran. In the 1980's the U.S. supported Iran's mortal enemy, Saddam Hussein of Iraq. 

Working through this history, the soft-spoken Iranian gradually became more heated. 

""I'm not saying that we should live in the past, but we should not try to find dramatic solutions,"" he said, ""and if we see that there is a change in the U.S. attitude toward us, then we can do something with each other."" 

As translated by his official interpreter, Larijani went on to say: 

""You know, these days we are supposed to paving the ground for the ratification and the implementation of the deal. We have to prepare the public opinion for this, but everyday it seems that your secretary of defense [Ash Carter] wakes up in the morning, opens the window, he shouts something at Iran and says that the military option is still on the table. 

So what does this mean? If you really want to do — to have war, then just go with it. Why are you just talking about it all the time? Why is it that you just talk about it? I mean, does — does it solve anything? Is it of any use?"" 

A Farsi speaker employed by NPR heard Larijani's wording slightly differently—he did not literally say ""go with it""—but added that the interpreter properly captured Larijani's meaning and tone. 

A provocative question had led to Larijani's outburst: would he like to invite U.S. lawmakers, many of whom disapprove of the nuclear deal, to visit Iran? 

Larijani concluded his long answer by saying, in effect, that this is not possible yet. 

He described the nuclear agreement as a test for the United States — just as the United States has posed the agreement as a test for Iran.",e9c9d2d9-a5f0-45fa-89ca-bf8470bf87c6,News,2015-09-08T10:07:31Z,WAMC.org,"Iran Parliament Chief: Nuclear Deal Is 'Acceptable,' U.S. Interpretation Is Not",0.0,News

4682,"Chinese President Xi Jinping addresses the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit 2015 at the UN headquarters in New York, Sept. 26, 2015. (Xinhua/Ma Zhancheng) 
 
UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping announced here on Saturday that China will provide 2 billion U.S. dollars to support South-South cooperation, and called for an equitable development path for all countries. 
 
China will set up a fund, with initial contribution of 2 billion dollars, to support South-South cooperation and assist developing countries in implementing their post-2015 development agenda, Xi told the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit at the UN headquarters in New York. 
 
Xi said China will also do its best to raise its investment in the least developed countries (LDCs) to 12 billion dollars by 2030. 
 
In addition, China will exempt the debt of the outstanding intergovernmental interest-free loans due by the end of 2015 owed by the relevant LDCs, landlocked developing countries and small island developing countries, the president said. 
 
Xi's announcement of those support and assistance measures met with warm applause from the audience. 
 
As part of China's plan in implementing the post-2015 development agenda adopted by the UN summit, Xi also announced that China will establish an international development knowledge center to facilitate studies and exchanges by countries on theories and practices of development suited to their respective national conditions, and will propose discussion on establishing a global energy network to facilitate efforts to meet the global power demand with clean and green alternatives. 
 
The president added that China is ready to work with other relevant parties to move forward the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative, achieve an early operation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the BRICS New Development Bank, and contribute to the economic growth and people's well-being of the developing countries. 
 
XI'S OUTLINE FOR POST-2015 DEVELOPMENT 
 
Sharing his view on the post-2015 development agenda, Xi called for an equitable, open, all-round and innovation-driven development path, stressing that no country should be left behind. 
 
""We need to ensure equitable development to make access to development more equal,"" Xi told the audience. 
 
""Countries may differ in capacity for and achievement in development, but they have common yet differentiated responsibilities with shared objectives,"" he said. 
 
He called for improving global economic governance, increasing the representation and voice of developing countries, and giving all countries equal right to participating in international rule-making. 
 
""We need to ensure open development to deliver its benefits to all parties,"" Xi said, noting that all countries should uphold the multilateral trade system, build an open economy and come to share its benefits through mutual consultation and joint collaboration. 
 
The president also asked for ensuring ""all-round"" development to make the groundwork of development more solid, stressing the need to uphold equity and social justice, and to achieve harmonious coexistence between man and society and between man and nature. 
 
""We also need to ensue innovation-driven development to fully tap the development potential,"" Xi said. 
 
All countries should look to reform and innovation for ways to bring out their development potential, build stronger engines for growth, and cultivate core competitive edge that they have not had before, he said. 
 
To well implement the post-2015 development agenda, Xi put forward a four-point proposal for the international community: building up the development capacities; improving the international environment for development; updating the partnership for development; and strengthening the coordination mechanisms for development. 
 
""The international community has a duty to help developing countries with capacity building and provide them with support and assistance tailored to their actual needs,"" the president noted. 
 
He called on all countries to work together to maintain international peace for the sake of development. 
 
Meanwhile, international institutions should step up governance reform, and multilateral development agencies should increase their supply of development resources, he said. 
 
Xi proposed that the international community, while maintaining the role of South-North cooperation as the main channel, should work to deepen South-South and tripartite cooperation. 
 
In addition, Xi said, countries need to step up their macroeconomic policy coordination to avoid as much as possible negative spillover effects, and regional organizations should accelerate their integration process and build their overall competitiveness by mutually complementing intra-regional advantages. 
 
CHINA'S ROLE IN MDGS 
 
During his address, the president briefed the audience on the role and contributions of China in implementing the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) laid down 15 years ago. 
 
China has lifted 439 million people out of poverty and made remarkable progress in areas of education, health and women's welfare over the past 30-plus years since the country embarked on reform and opening-up, Xi said. 
 
Over the past 60-plus years, China has provided 166 countries and international organizations with nearly 400 billion yuan (about 63 billion dollars) worth of assistance, and dispatched over 600,000 aid workers, over 700 of whom have laid down their lives in helping the development of other countries, he said. 
 
""Looking to the future, China will continue to take a right approach to justice and interests by putting justice before interests and join other countries in the concerted efforts to realize the post-2015 development agenda,"" the president stressed.",0df8aa49-7f45-405c-b2ff-4f1df991e23b,News,2015-09-27T04:20:32Z,Tianshannet,"·China pledges 2 bln USD to support South-South cooperation, calls for equitable development",0.0,Blog

3413,"The tech giant’s patent envisions mobile phones, and even laptops, that could power up for weeks on one charge 

If there were a few things you could tweak about your mobile
phone, chances are a better battery life would top the list. Sure, the things
we can do with these pocket-sized computers is nothing short of astounding, but
as the quality of new devices seems to improve each year, the battery life of
even the most advanced phones stays nearly the same. 

Of course Apple dove into this well-known issue and has been
looking into a battery that could power up a phone, or even a laptop, for weeks.
The tech giant’s new patent, filed in March and published on September 3,
describes a “fuel cell system for a portable computing device.” 

Apple's patent for a fuel cell system for a portable computing device. 

The patent envisions a system consisting of a fuel cell,
which converts fuel to electrical power, an interface to the portable computing
device (which would be a smartphone or laptop), and a controller that monitors the state
of the fuel cell while, obviously, controlling it. 

Though Apple has submitted plenty of patent applications in
the past that we have yet to see, this one seems especially broad. One example
would be that it mentions a variety of possible fuel sources, from lithium
hydride and water mix to liquid hydrogen. The patent also says that it’s “extremely
challenging” to design portable, cost-effective hydrogen fuel cell systems. Of
course, a patent filing doesn’t mean we’ll soon see a product using the
technology. 

But for the time being, this idea is fun, and
interesting, to dream about. Maybe, just maybe, we’ll see a fuel cell iPhone sooner rather than later. 

Do you think this type of technology will exist anytime
soon? Let us know your thoughts — leave a comment below.

This is where your dinner party guests get really stimulated when discussing the explosion in house prices in the Emerald City and the wealth effect this represents for them.

Or living in Mosman. The party isn’t for you. The fact that access to housing wealth is increasingly unavailable to large sections of Sydney society might not concern Baby Boomers minting it and buying two, three or more homes while others cannot buy one.

6061,"Portland High junior Emmanuel Johnson breaks free from White House junior Danny Stoutt for a two-point conversion. (Photo: Dave Cardaciotto / For Sumner County Publications) 

WHITE HOUSE — The Portland High football team opened Region 5-4A play by ending a two-game skid against White House, pulling out a 28-17 win at Dewey H. Whitson Stadium. 

The Panthers (2-1, 1-0) used a big play before halftime to take a 16-10 lead and never trailed again. 

“Our kids just continued to battle and battle all night,” Panthers head coach Greg Cavanah said. “I’m just so tickled for them and for where we are at right now as a team.” 

White House was able to start fast out of the gates as they raced to a 10-0 lead after a 26-yard Logan Trimmer field goal was followed up by a 34-yard touchdown run by senior Trey Hyde. 

After the White House touchdown drive, the Panthers drove 80 yards in 11 plays as Ethan Brummett scored from 1 yard out. The Panthers converted on the two-point try. 

The Blue Devils were able to quickly cross back into Panther territory early into their next possession but were unable to change the scoreboard as Trimmer missed a field goal from 30-yards out with 33 seconds left in the first half. 

After a 24-yard run by senior Dylan Parker, it seemed like the Panthers would only have one play left in the half. That play saw them lose 4 yards and the clock expire. However, a penalty on the Blue Devils gave the Panthers one more opportunity from midfield with an untimed down. 

The Panthers dipped into their bag of tricks and converted as Brummett completed a 20-yard pass to Michael Hussey. Hussey lateraled the ball back to a streaking Emmanuel Johnson, who raced to the end zone for the touchdown. 

“Coach (Mark) Nelson has been working on that play for about three weeks now,” Cavanah said. “After they called a timeout and backed up their defense, he said that he was going for it. I told him it was his baby, go for it and he did.” 

The play left the home crowd stunned as the Panthers converted on another two-point conversion and took a 16-10 lead into the locker room. 

“We gave up way too many big plays tonight, gasoline plays that got them fired up,” White House head coach Jeff Porter said. “Obviouslym one of them was the play before the half, and that was on us.” 

The second half saw the Panthers take advantage of a Luke Hopkins fumble midway through the third quarter. Portland took over on the Blue Devil 14 yard line and used a big play on a fourth-and-12 play that saw Brummett connect with Kemper Dixon for a 16-yard touchdown and a 22-10 lead. 

The Blue Devils marched right back down the field and answered the Portland touchdown with one of their own as Hopkins ran 25 yards straight through the middle of the defense to cut the lead to 22-17. 

It appeared that White House had turned the momentum completely around as the host squad recovered a Panther fumble just three plays later. However, the Blue Devils would give it right back two plays later as junior Ronald Honeycutt fumbled while attempting to gain extra yardage. 

White House had one more chance to take the lead later in the half. On first and goal at the 2 yard line, a Hopkins fumble gave the ball back to Portland. 

The Panthers sealed the victory with a 95-yard drive that was highlighted by a 56-yard Brummett run and capped by a 5-yard touchdown run by Johnson. 

“Even after we had the late fumble, I thought we still had a shot,” Porter said. “We just couldn’t get a stop when we needed, and I give them (Portland) all the credit for that.”

2893,"Stacey Pennington, the 46-year-old woman shot and killed outside her Mount Gretna gift shop Monday morning, had obtained a Protection From Abuse order against her alleged assailant last December after he attacked her in her home. 
 
Patrick Lynn Derr, 47, who was accused of fatally shooting Pennington , was to be sentenced Wednesday on charges of assault and harassment stemming from a Dec. 26 incident in her South Lebanon Township home. 
 
This wasn't Derr's first violent episode involving a woman. 
 
In 2008, a former girlfriend had also obtained a PFA against him after an attack in Millcreek Township in which she said he tried to rape her. He was found innocent in a jury trial of attempted rape, but was found guilty of assault and harassment. 
 
In the PFA order obtained by Pennington, she said Derr was drunk when he came into her bedroom, took a TV remote from her hand, grabbed her by the throat, threw her against the headboard and a corner cabinet, and began strangling her. 
 
Pennington said he trapped her in the bedroom, threw her into the closet, told her she wasn't going to leave for 48 hours, and blocked the doorway. 
 
As she tried to leave, he threw her down and stepped on her throat, Pennington told authorities. She was able to get away, and asked him for ice for her injured knee, and fled to a neighbor's home for help. 
 
South Lebanon Township police said Pennington told them her live-in boyfriend, Derr, had pushed, slapped and struck her multiple times and choked her. They charged Derr with two counts of simple assault and one of harassment. 
 
Derr pleaded guilty to the charges and was to be sentenced Wednesday in Lebanon County court. 
 
In the restraining order, Pennington said she wasn't aware that Derr owned any firearms. The order prohibited him from acquiring any firearms for the duration of the order, which was to be Jan. 29, 2018. 
 
In the 2008 charges from Millcreek Township, Derr was found innocent of attempted rape, aggravated assault, terroristic threats and false imprisonment in an October 2008 trial. But he was found guilty of simple assault and harassment, and sentenced to one to 12 months in prison. 
 
That victim told police Derr became violent after she declined to have sex with him, and ripped her underwear off, hit her in the head and tried to choke her.

4009,"FILM REVIEW A Walk in the Woods Robert Redford, Nick Nolte; Dir: Ken Kwapis It’s nice to see two older actors starring in a film, but a little hard to reconcile it with the fact that the book, written by Bill Bryson, depicts two travellers in their Forties. The plot is simple. Following a funeral, Bryson (Redford) has something of a very late mid-life crisis, and decides to walk the Appalachian trail, all 2000-odd miles of it. His wife (Emma Thompson, as usual portraying someone far older than her years) is completely against the idea, but grudgingly lets him go provided he takes along a companion. Enter, staggering, Nick Nolte as his old friend who gets invited by accident and decides he is in great shape and can do the walk. There is little more to it than that. The film starts with Bryson being interviewed on television by someone who clearly has no idea about him, and there are several more funny scenes dotted like way markers throughout the film. Otherwise there’s only so much you can do with two grumpy/jolly/chatty old men coming into shot, passing, then walking away again. The scenery looks wonderful and there are some nice small parts for Thompson and Mary Steenbergen. The chemistry between Redford and Nolte (a part he originally wanted to play with Paul Newman) is nicely portrayed, and there’s a familiar moment when they look at a lake from an impossibly high cliff top. You almost expect him to say “you do the thinking, Butch – that’s what you’re good at!” It’s a small film, good fun while it lasts, and has some poignant moments, but you really do need to suspend your disbelief that two inexperienced unfit old-timers could actually even attempt something this gruelling, a problem that didn't arise with Reese Witherspoon in Wild. Still, it’s pleasant to see the stars flexing their acting muscles again.

1876,"Transaction Marks Third Disposition for JV in 2015 

DALLAS, TX--(Marketwired - September 16, 2015) - Sealy & Company, a fully-integrated commercial real estate investment and operating company and recognized leader in the industrial real estate market, and AEW Capital Management (AEW) announced the disposition of 200 Interstate South Drive in McDonough, Georgia. The Class A, multi-tenant bulk warehouse is located in the South Atlanta Industrial market, the second-largest submarket in Atlanta. The 434,760-square-foot property features modern amenities, a superior location, and national credit tenants. 200 Interstate South is located in the Interstate South Business Park and features four (4) ingress/egress points with excellent access to I-75 and high visibility. AEW sold the property on behalf of AEW Partners VII, L.P. 

When the property was acquired in 2013, it was 90% occupied and the in-place rents were 5 to 10% below historical market rental rates. Over the 24-month ownership period, Sealy & AEW successfully executed their strategy to increase occupancy to 100% and brought rents to at or above market while maintaining national credit tenant quality. This was achieved by completing a new 10-year lease for 300,000 square feet to a national credit tenant prior to the existing tenant’s termination and by renewing an existing tenant at a rental increase, both of which created value and enhanced the return upon disposition. 

“Sealy’s partnership with AEW has been a tremendous success due to our entrepreneurial approach, local market expertise, and ability to implement creative strategies that add value. We look forward to potential future opportunities with AEW,” stated Scott Sealy Jr., Vice President and Business Development for Sealy & Company. 

The JV is actively pursuing assets and portfolios in major industrial markets with a defined investment size between $5 million and $100 million.

8114,"I have been a fan of the Fire and Water Podcast for a while now, listening to Rob (of Aquaman Shrine fame)  and Shag (of Firestorm Fan fame) discuss Aquaman, Firestorm, Who's Who comics, and comics in general. That show is sort of my Monday morning ritual, listening to them banter while I sip my coffee in my office and start my work week.
So I was thrilled to be asked by Rob to appear on the show as a guest. Today Fire and Water Episode 140 drops, discussing a story from 1989's Christmas with the Super-Heroes #2, a story written by Alan Brennert and drawn by Dick Giordano. This is the famous Deadman story 'Should Auld Acquaintance Be Forgot', a story with a famous secret guest star.
Head over to Firestorm Fan, Aquaman Shrine, and Tumblr  to see posts about this particular show and to listen.
I can't t thank Rob enough for asking me on to talk about this story and Supergirl in general.
This is a pretty famous (or infamous) story that I have already covered on this blog way back in 2010 here.
This book came out about a year after the Matrix Supergirl was introduced into the DCU. It also was a couple of months after we saw Matrix, shapeshifted into Superman, go insane and flee to outer space to try to find herself.
This was really a tough time for Supergirl fans. Not only had the original Supergirl been removed from continuity, completely forgotten but Matrix had come on board, gone nuts, and left. We had (at least at this point) a true imposter in the role. And it was going to get worse before it got better.
So this story was a complete treasure for Kara fans.
In the podcast, I talk about how I insert this panel into lectures I give trainees at the hospital (medical students, residents, and fellows). I, of course, insert trademarks and copyright information at the bottom of the slide.
I put this in lectures that are early in the academic year, when the trainees are realizing how hard their job is going to be and need a little inspiration. They are often fatigued and feeling unrecognized. So this panel is perfect.
This story was being showcased on podcast because TwoMorrows Back Issue magazine is doing a Supergirl centric issue (out this week) which includes Rob's interview with Alan Brennert. Here is a link! Go and buy it here at TWOMORROWS’ BACK ISSUE! - http://twomorrows.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=98_54&products_id=1210&zenid=7h10ejk34ml83ol190oo48qvr3

5574,"Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'BBB' rating on the following City of 
      Atlantic Beach, Florida Health Care Facilities bonds issued on behalf of 
      Naval Continuing Care Retirement Foundation, Inc. d/b/a Fleet Landing 
      (Fleet): 
 
--$40,050,000 Revenue and Refunding Bonds (Fleet Landing Project) series 
      2013A; 
 
--$17,610,000 Revenue Bonds (Fleet Landing Project) series 2013B. 
 
The Rating Outlook has been revised to Positive from Stable. 
 
SECURITY 
 
A gross revenue pledge and mortgage. A debt service reserve fund 
      provides additional security. 
 
KEY RATING DRIVERS 
 
POSITIVE PERFORMANCE TREND CONTINUES: The Positive Outlook reflects the 
      continued strengthening in Fleet's financial results, with Fleet's 
      operating ratio (97.3%), net operating margin - adjusted (41.3%) and 
      maximum annual debt service (MADS) coverage (4.1x) in 2014, all 
      exceeding their respective Fitch's 'BBB' category medians and all at 
      their highest levels over the four year historical period. The strong 
      2014 performance led to continued growth in unrestricted cash and 
      investments, which has now grown 206% since year end 2011 and totaled 
      $37.2 million at June 30, 2015. 
 
LAND PURCHASE: In 2014, Fleet borrowed $2.8 million to purchase a 6.7 
      acre parcel of land contiguous with its campus, which is currently being 
      used for commercial purposes. While the additional debt is not a credit 
      concern, Fleet is exploring the potential development of the land, which 
      could be part of a larger campus repositioning project and include a 
      debt issuance. 
 
PROJECTS PROGRESS: Fleet is in the third and final phase of a capital 
      project, funded with the 2013B debt issuance, which has included 
      renovation and expansion of Fleet's assisted living (AL) and health 
      center. A new AL/memory care support building opened in 2015 and 
      occupancy of the 24 units is at approximately 95%. Fleet is renovating 
      its health center in phase three, which will reduce the number of beds 
      to 64 from 78, while moving to mostly private beds. Fitch notes 
      positively that Fleet's interim results remain strong in spite of the 
      renovations, including 20 skilled nursing beds being offline. 
 
OTHER CREDIT STRENGTHS: The Positive Outlook also reflects Fleet's other 
      credit strengths including high occupancy across all levels of care, its 
      sizable and attractive campus, and competitive IL entrance fee pricing. 
 
RATING SENSITIVITIES 
 
RESOLUTION OF OUTLOOK: The Positive Outlook reflects the Naval 
      Continuing Care Retirement Foundation, Inc. d/b/a Fleet Landing's strong 
      financial profile; however, an upgrade is precluded at this time due to 
      the potential development of the new property, which could happen over 
      the next three to five years and include a debt issuance. Fitch expects 
      more clarity on the project within the next two years, and should the 
      Naval Continuing Care Retirement Foundation, Inc. d/b/a Fleet Landing's 
      financial profile continue to strengthen, indicating that it could 
      handle the additional debt at the higher level, an upgrade would be 
      likely within the next 12 to 24 months. 
 
CREDIT PROFILE 
 
Fleet Landing is a type-A continuing care retirement community located 
      in Jacksonville, FL. The community consists of 354 independent living 
      units, including 190 cottages, 73 assisted living units, 24 memory care 
      units, and 58 skilled nursing beds. In the year ended Dec. 31, 2014, 
      Fleet had total operating revenues of approximately $32.5 million. 
 
Rating Affirmation/Positive Outlook 
 
The 'BBB' affirmation and Positive Outlook reflect Fleet's high 
      occupancy, solid financial results, and above median coverage. In June 
      2015, Fleet had IL occupancy of 94%, AL occupancy of 96%, memory care 
      occupancy of 93%, and SNF occupancy 87%. The strong demand for services 
      across all care levels helps drive and sustain Fleet's operating 
      performance. 
 
Its net operating margin-adjusted has averaged 35.7% over the past four 
      audited years, comparing favorably to Fitch's 'BBB' category median of 
      20.4%. In addition, good fill up on turned over apartments has led to 
      net entrance fee receipts growing each year over the last four years, 
      and net entrance fee receipts were a healthy $12.9 million in 2014. 
 
The strong cash flow has helped Fleet generate solid MADS coverage. Over 
      the past four audited years Fleet's MADS coverage averaged 3.1x and 
      stood at 4.1x at June 30, 2015, relative to a median of 2x. MADS of $4.1 
      million represented 12.4% of revenues at June 30, 2015, which compares 
      well to Fitch's category median of 12.3%. 
 
Unrestricted cash and investments have materially improved as a result 
      of the strong cash flow. At June 30, 2015, Fleet had $37.2 million in 
      unrestricted cash and investments, which was up from $28.8 million at 
      June 30, 2014 and equated to 550 days cash on hand (DCOH), a 9.2x 
      cushion ratio, and 61.6%. All of these figures are at or above category 
      medians. Fitch views Fleet's improved liquidity position as a credit 
      positive and believes continued building of the balance sheet will be 
      key, should Fleet move forward with an expansion project. 
 
Land Acquisition/New Debt 
 
In 2014, Fleet purchased a 6.7 acre parcel of land that is contiguous to 
      its property. The land is currently being used for commercial purposes, 
      housing retail stores, although only two tenants remain. Fleet took out 
      a $2.8 million bank loan to purchase the land. The loan is a five-year 
      note, with a 3.7% fixed rate. 
 
Fitch anticipates that Fleet will look to develop this land over the 
      medium term and expects clarity on this over the next two years, 
      including any additional debt plans. Fleet does have debt capacity at 
      the current rating level given the strengthening of its financial 
      profile over the past few years, and should the positive trend in 
      performance be sustained, Fitch believes Fleet could be positioned to 
      undertake the project and the higher rating level. However, any impact 
      on the rating will be determined by the final size and scope of the 
      project and the magnitude and timing of any new debt. 
 
Competitive Service Area 
 
There are three continuing care retirement community (CCRC) competitors 
      in Fleet's primary service area. Life Care Ponte Vedra (d/b/a Vicar's 
      Landing - rated 'BBB' by Fitch), The Glenmoor, and Cypress Village. 
      However, Fitch believes that Fleet's long presence in the market, modest 
      IL pricing, and well maintained campus help mitigate competitive 
      concerns. 
 
Outstanding Debt Profile 
 
All of Fleet's debt is fixed, and Fleet has no outstanding swaps. 
 
Disclosure 
 
Fleet covenants to provide annual financial information to EMMA no later 
      than 150 days after the fiscal year-end.

2086,"Planning for a bypass road around Batemans Bay, from the Princes Highway to Surf Beach, began, perhaps, 30 years ago. 

PLANNING for a bypass road around Batemans Bay, from the Princes Highway to Surf Beach, began, perhaps, 30 years ago.

When the Batemans Bay bypass is eventually completed, traffic density in the Batemans Bay CBD is predicted to lessen significantly.

The problem is that no-one seems to be able to say when the bypass road (or spine road) will be completed, the state government being the current hold-up.

Surely the Minister for Transport can use some influence with RMS to sort out funding for this connection and make it a properly funded priority, and forget about the boundary change and amalgamation idea that will prove to be a financial liability on the shire’s

residents if it ever were to proceed.

3008,"Forget 2016. Kanye West says he's planning to run for president in 2020. 
 
In a candid and at times heartfelt acceptance speech at Sunday night's MTV Video Music Awards, the rapper concluded his remarks by announcing a presidential bid for the election five years from now. 
 
""I don't know what I finna lose after this. It don't matter, though; It's not about me. It's about ideas. New ideas. People with ideas. People who believe in truth,"" West said. ""And yes, as you probably could've guessed by this moment, I have decided in 2020 to run for president."" 
 
It was unclear how serious West was about his plans for running for president. He told the audience that if they are wondering ""Did he smoke something before he came out here,"" then ""the answer is 'Yes, I rolled up a little something. I knocked the edge off.'"" 
 
The declaration came after his reflections on whether he would have acted differently if he could change his behavior during the infamous 2009 incident when he grabbed the microphone from VMA award winner Taylor Swift. 
 
Last night, Swift presented West with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award and an impassioned West told the audience that he still doesn't understand award shows--- ""I don't understand it, bruh,""--- and he pondered out loud whether he would have disrupted Swift's speech if had had a daughter at the time. 
 
""I'm not no politician, bruh,"" West said, remarking on the decision to have Swift present him with the award this year. ""You know how many times they announced Taylor was going to give me the award. Because it got them more ratings. Listen to the kids, bruh!"" West said.",3d951442-7d72-45ca-b23a-b5c88311af97,News,2015-09-01T01:25:32Z,Our Weekly,"Kanye West declares 2020 presidential bid at VMAs Aug 31, 2015, 10:51 a.m. read more →",0.0,News

874,"In part 1 of this series I discussed the deeply discounted preferred shares of National Bank of Greece (NYSE:NBG) and the bank’s difficult path forward. Here, I’ll take a look at the deeply discounted preferred shares of Fannie Mae (OTCQB:FNMA) which have some similarities but a lot more differences. Background Most people know Fannie Mae and its cousin Freddie Mac (OTCQB:FMCC) as two companies that required a massive bailout and were taken over by the government. But there is much more to the story. Instead of actually acquiring all the equity of Fannie and Freddie, the Treasury acquired a senior preferred stock stake with a 10% dividend and warrants to purchase 79.9% of the common stock of each. In 2012, the Treasury modified the agreement ending the 10% dividend and replacing it with a net worth sweep where payments would not count towards reducing the outstanding Treasury-owned preferred stock. Since then, profits at Fannie and Freddie have surged and the companies have returned more money to the Treasury than they were provided in total. Despite this, dividends on the privately-owned preferred shares remain suspended since all profits are still taken in the net worth sweep. Prospects Under the status quo, the preferreds have no value except as bets on a change since there would not be any profits left at the company to pay them. But a variety of stakeholders from hedge fund managers to consumer advocates are challenging the legality of the net worth sweep in the courts and even proposing their own solutions. At the same time, political plans are being drawn up to reform the mortgage system with varying outcomes for Fannie and Freddie stakeholders. Full recovery Like most large financial firms, Fannie Mae has a long list of preferred series but all of them have their dividends suspended, trade around 15 cents on the dollar, and are not convertible (with the exception of the $100,000 liquidation value convertible FNMFO shares). This implies a potential gain of 550% to liquidation value. Full recovery to liquidation value would require the dividends to be restored which could only happen after the net worth sweep is ended. I won’t go into an extended legal discussion as many SA authors have already done an excellent job of this but to summarize it would likely require a court to find the 2012 amendment that created the net worth sweep to be overturned. There is also the possibility that Congress could take action to end the net worth sweep as part of a broad-based mortgage reform package. However, given that current plans have relied upon wiping out private investors, I view a political solution as far less likely. Delayed recovery It is important to recognize that the return to liquidation value would not immediately follow an end of the net worth sweep. Fannie and Freddie would likely have to grow capital levels to create a capital cushion to protect against a future mortgage downturn. Bill Ackman, manager of Pershing Square (OTCPK:PSHZF), has proposed a 2.5% requirement but that would still require a few years to raise done solely through retained earnings. Since the preferred shares are non-cumulative, Fannie Mae may choose to keep preferred dividends suspended until capital levels are rebuilt. With preferred dividends suspended but the net worth sweep ended, I would expect the preferred shares to trade at around 75 cents on the dollar until dividends are restored. This valuation would be similar to those of the preferred shares of Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS) and National Bank of Greece when the dividend remained suspended but a reinstatement appeared near. This situation would imply roughly 400% upside from current levels. Settlement or conversion to common As the plaintiffs continue to press their claims against the net worth sweep, the government may choose to opt for a settlement rather than pursue a long costly case it may end up losing. It’s unknown what valuation a settlement would offer although the plaintiffs are likely to push for a substantial sum given the amount they have invested in Fannie and Freddie. A settlement could also come in multiple forms including an upfront cash payment, conversion to common shares, or rolling into a new class of preferred. Recently Dick Bove speculated that a settlement in the Fannie and Freddie cases may be near based on request from the White House. In my view, this is just speculation and not necessarily indicative of an upcoming settlement. However, this does not mean a settlement can be ruled out now or in the future. Wipeout Fannie and Freddie preferred are trading at 15 cents on the dollar for two main reasons: The potential for total loss and the potential for a resolution to take several years. Until the net worth sweep is ended, these preferreds only have value as bets on a potential future outcome. This does not necessarily make them bad investments but without a change to the net worth sweep investors have little chance at receiving capital appreciation or dividends. The preferred also have the potential for total loss in the event that the plaintiffs lose their cases or give up for any reason. Given what the plaintiffs have invested, I expect them to pursue their cases to the end but circumstances can change so a change in strategy cannot be ruled out. The plaintiffs could also lose their legal cases since courts are unpredictable and could interpret the law in multiple ways. At that point, investors would be reliant upon a much less likely solution from Congress that gives private investors value. Fannie Mae preferred takeaway Although the preferred dividends remain suspended, the company could easily pay them if the net worth sweep was ended. However, the current legal and political situation throws a lot of risk and uncertainty into these shares causing them to trade at a significant discount. As with most preferreds at 15 cents on the dollar, Fannie Mae preferreds remain a speculative investment. But those with a long-term investment horizon and a tolerance for risk may want to consider a position in these shares.

4179,"WASHINGTON – Agriculture Deputy Secretary Krysta Harden and Dr. Susan Kelly, Director of the Department of Defense's Transition to Veterans Program Office, today announced the integration of agriculture into the career training and counseling programs Service members receive as they transition out of the military. Information about USDA resources and programs will now reach 200,000 transitioning Service members every year. 

""Rural America disproportionately sends its sons and daughters to serve in the military. When Service members return home, we want them to know that rural America has a place for them --no matter where they're from,"" said Deputy Secretary Harden. ""This expanded collaboration between USDA and DOD will help to ensure that returning Service members know that there are a wide variety of loans, grants, training and technical assistance for veterans who are passionate about a career in agriculture, no matter their experience level."" 

""Our transitioning Service members leave the military with a variety of essential skills - including leadership and discipline - that could be directly applied to a career in agriculture,"" said Dr. Susan S. Kelly, Director of the Department of Defense's Transition to Veterans Program Office. ""For those members who are considering farming or ranching as a post-service career, I encourage them to learn more about the opportunities, preferences, and incentives offered by the USDA."" 

Every year, approximately 200,000 Service members complete the Transition Assistance Program as they prepare for civilian life. This partnership will help to ensure that returning Service members know about the incentives for military veterans in USDA programs, and the many ways USDA can support military veterans and their families, from farm loans to conservation programs to nutrition assistance to rural rental housing and homeownership opportunities. Veterans can also visit www.usda.gov/veterans , a website designed specifically to educate them about USDA programs. 

Since 2009, USDA has provided $438 million in farm loans to help more than 6,482 veterans purchase farmland, buy equipment and make repairs and upgrades. Our microloans, which offer smaller amounts of support to meet the needs of small- or niche-type farm operations, have also grown in popularity among veterans. Since it was launched in January 2013, USDA's microloan program has provided more than $22.6 million in support to help 1,083 veterans grow their farming businesses. 

Today's announcement reflects USDA's continued commitment to assisting veterans as they start or expand farming and ranching operations, in order to strengthen the American economy and provide livelihoods to our returning veterans. Today, more than 5 million veterans live in rural areas, a higher concentration than in any other part of the country. 

Our veterans have incredible stories to share, including:

Two women on board a JetBlue flight from Kingston, Jamaica to JFK airport in New York got into a brawl as the flight arrived at the gate, resulting in two arrests. 
 

 
USA Today reports that, according to New York media, 61-year-old Jean Ballentine of Brooklyn, NY tried to climb out of her window seat over 52-year-old Mary Cannady of Linden, NJ. 
 
The New York Daily News reports that Cannady pushed the older woman out of the way, and got punched in the face when she did. Port Authority spokesman Joe Pentagelo said that when another person tried to intervene between the two, Ballentine pulled out an eyebrow razor and slashed the good samaritan on the elbow. 
 
Cannady then pulled out a small can of pepper spray and hit Ballentine in the face with the spray. Several people on board reported breathing difficulties after the spray was used. 
 
The captain opened the cabin door and ordered Ballentine escorted off the plane. 
 
In a statement, JetBlue said that ""On August 26, a customer disagreement occurred shortly after flight 960 arrived at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport from Kingston, Jamaica. Law enforcement were called and met the aircraft."" 
 
Both women were placed under arrest on a variety of charges. What is not known is how the two women were allowed to board the plane with the razor and the pepper spray. Security screenings in Kingston, where the flight originated, are the purview of the Jamaican Civil Aviation Authority.

2075,"Due to changes in the reporting of their financial results, Microsoft has moved the Xbox gaming division into the same segment as Windows. 



Microsoft announced this yesterday on their website : 

Microsoft Corporation today announced that it will change the reporting of its financial results to reflect the company’s strategy and ambitions to build best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world. Beginning in fiscal year 2016, the company will report revenue and operating income based on three operating segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing 

Advertisements     

Prior to this change, the Xbox division was part of the Entertainment & Devices division. With the Xbox gaming division being placed into the ‘More Personal Computing’ segment, the financial results of Xbox gaming will be even harder to discern. According to Neogaf user ZhugeEX, this also shows how Microsoft has changed as a company to focus on Cloud and Office. Even more so the chance shows how Microsoft is trying to fade the lines between PC and the Xbox brand. 

The More Personal Computing segment includes results from licensing of the Windows operating system, devices such as Surface and phones, gaming including Xbox consoles, and search. 

The Xbox brand is part of Microsoft’s gaming division, which was established back in 2002 as Microsoft Game Studios. In 2011 Microsoft rebranded the production wing to ‘Microsoft Studios’. Microsoft Studios consists of 30 studios worldwide, including Rare, Lionhead, 343 Industries and The Coalition.

1586,"Cheryl Dunn: New York SoulCheryl Dunn was born in Old Tappan, NJ, and currently resides in New York City. She received her BA in Art History from Rutgers University. Cheryl has had numerous group and solo exhibitions around the world, and has had several books published, including “She Swallowed It,” “Sometimes the Answer,” and “Some Kinda Vacation.” Below she speaks to Alex Coghe about her photographic efforts and her film “Everybody Street,” which documents the lives and works of New York’s iconic street photographers and the city that inspires them. Q: How and when did you get started with photography? A: I have been shooting pictures since I was a teenager. In my early 20’s, I went to Europe and lived for 2 years. I did not speak the language of the countries I was living in, so sometimes I wouldn’t speak for weeks. I walked the streets, took pictures, and looked at art most of the time. My observational skills became quite keen because that is all I had really. I would make up stories about people, and what was happening in a scene, and I guess this is when I really started to do street photography. When I returned home, I became a photo assistant and did personal documentary projects. Photography was the only thing that fully engaged me in every way. Q: You are a great street photographer, but you do commercial work too. I love both souls of your work, and I consider your work with models to be very inspiring. Do you feel there is a way to integrate your documentary vision into your commercial work? I am particularly interested to learn about your experience as a street photographer as you made stunning works on assignment for your clients. A: I embrace the challenges of assignments. I like to shoot assignments and fashion on the streets because of the uncontrollable variables. A fashion shoot on the street is not necessarily documentary in nature but when you go to the streets to do something, you are in a sea of other people and anything can and does happen, particularly when you are shooting models; it’s really fun and funny. At this point of my career, I get hired to do what I do for the most part, which is awesome. So I get to put the documentary, discovery, and the unpredictability of street photography into my work most of the time. As a street photographer, you really have to react fast, predict behavior, chase light, or wait for action to happen. All of these skills are very helpful while doing assignments. On the street, maybe you don’t have a time limit to make the shot, but you certainly do on assignment. Being able to see the best situation quickly and solve problems fast comes from all of these shooting experiences. You just get better at it. Q: Apart from still photography, you are also a filmmaker. How did you get started making films? A: I started making films in the mid ’90s. I always seemed to be shooting film of artists and sub-cultures, and I also documented a lot of graffiti writers. I thought it was super important to document artists and their processes, because things change so fast, so that is why I started making films about individual creatives and collaborations between artists. Q: Your 2013 documentary “Everybody Street” is considered one of the best films ever dedicated to photography, and you received a lot of awards for it. When did you get the idea to make this film? A: I was asked by a museum in lower Manhattan to come up with a film idea that could play within an Alfred Stieglitz exhibition, so I pitched the idea to make a film about photographers who went to the streets of NY, and created a substantial body of work inspired by that practice. Selfishly, I wanted to meet my idols (and I did) after showing the short at the museum, and then I was invited to show it at the Tate modern. I went back into the project to expand it to feature-length because there was so much more to say. Quoting a review about the movie: “I appreciate the diversity of thought and approach in the street that Dunn’s documentary depicts: this is an invitation to reflect for everyone. There is not homologation, and this is an invitation to reflect for everyone. We can see photographers more focused on portraits, others on the decisive moment. Bruce Gilden is very different by Joel Meyerowitz…” Q: I think the great merit of this movie is how it presents a diversity of approach and aesthetics without simply demonstrating a way to take pictures in the street. Do you agree? Aren’t we all street photographers? A: Yes, I agree. I wanted to show all the different ways people do it. The photographers in my film are all very different, with varied approaches. There are so many great street photographers, but there is more to photography than simply pressing a button. Q: “Everybody Street” presents New York City as the city for excellence in street photography. What are some of the unique characteristics that come with taking street photography here? A: The one thing about NY that makes it interesting for me is the way the light is here. Manhattan is a small island surrounded by water. Skyscrapers of glass and steel, and tons of people in concentration. Light is bouncing everywhere; people are on top of each other with crazy scenes unfolding before your eyes. It’s ripe for street photographers. Q: And do you think the Big Apple still represents the capital of street photography? A: There are many great cities for street photography as populations increase all over the world. But in the last century, NY was the center of the arts, it was in what they called “The New World.” This city was having an industrial revolution and most of all, it is maybe one of the most multicultural cities; there is every type of person walking the streets. And yes, it is a city that everyone walks in. Q: Among all the photographers presented and interviewed in the documentary, do you have a favorite? A: Not really. They are all so different, and I am a fan of each of them. I became good friends with Jill Freedman and Boogie in the making of the film. Q: It’s been two years, is there anything you wish you could change about the project? A: This film took me four years. And what I want to change is having more time to shoot on the streets. Q: Are you preparing another documentary? What will be the theme this time? A: Yes, I am starting on a new film about the New York artist Dash Snow. I think the ’60s and ’70s, but also the ’80s in the Big Apple with photographers like Garry Winogrand and Joel Meyerowitz, and then Bruce Gilden and Bruce Davidson, representing an unrepeatable period for this genre. They choose to go out to take pictures as a genuine need; they never imagined that they would become recognized as the masters today, when street photographers are living in the social network era where everyone thinks of being famous. Q: What is the state of Street Photography today? And what are the main differences from the golden era of street photography? A: There are great street photographers today, but the judge of what is great now are followers on Instagram and likes. And who are those people? Are they the same people that make Instagram accounts about cats and dogs the most popular? So who is really deciding what is great or not now? It is a different time. The golden age of photography included artists that knew every aspect of the medium and did them all –processing film, printing pictures, etc. They all had darkrooms. They were artisans. Most people that are popular on Instagram don’t know anything about that stuff. And does it matter? I don’t know, but that is one of the differences. Q: Is there an artist that you feel shares your attitude and approach to the photographic medium? A: In my film I would say Boogie. (Bruce Davidson) Q: What does street photography mean to you? A: It’s something I need to do. I am always riddled with anxiety because I have a lot of other work to do, and I don’t get to the streets as much as I want to. Q: How did you first become interested in Leica? A: I think probably studying the masters: Cartier-Bresson, Bruce Davidson, Garry Winogrand, and the like. I wanted to be as nimble and quick as I could, and I knew this was my camera. It took me a while to save up for the gear I have. Since Leica really stands the test of time, it’s fine to buy used gear, and I have done that a lot, one piece at a time; if I got a decent job, I would buy a new lens or something. It’s just the best camera for me, such a beautiful machine. The lenses are incredible, and I can handle the weight. I am always shooting them, so they are like an extension of my body at this point. Q: You are using Leica M6, M7, and M9. Do you have you a preference between film and digital photography? When you prefer to use film? When do you go digital? A: I shoot film mostly for my personal work. I’m trying to like digital more. I use it commercially more so, but my film pictures are what I love. Q: Do you have any favorite lens? A: I mostly had a 35 f/1.2. for so long. Then a 90 mm, and a 21 mm. After that, I got the 50 mm f/1.4 Summilux. I love it so much. The last one I got was a 28 mm ASPH. Q: What about Leica today? What are the reasons your cameras are Leica, and not from other brands? A: They are like a beautiful diamond ring: forever the best. Q: If you could test a new Leica camera what would it be, and why? A: I would like to try the Monochrom. I just ran into Boogie in my neighborhood, and he was rocking one. He kept going on about how great it was. And I have heard this from other people as well. I would like to try it. Q: What are some of your challenges? What will be the new goals for Cheryl Dunn? A: A balance of film and photography, and being able to have the time to explore the subjects that inspire me.

1164,"A change in prime minister could boost the Australian economy, analysts say. Source: AAP 

AUSTRALIAN businesses are anticipating a shot in the arm from the change in prime minister before Malcolm Turnbull has even spelled out policy. 

INDUSTRY bodies welcomed the arrival of a PM with a track record in business and warmed to the idea that the former investment banker can succeed where Tony Abbott failed, using a more collegiate and co-operative style of government to push through economic reforms. 

Analysts say he could lift consumer confidence through his popularity with voters and help business by articulating the need for reform. 

Business Council of Australia president Catherine Livingstone said companies would respond to leadership that ""explains our national challenges ... while respecting the intelligence of the community to embrace change for the better"". 

""A stronger economy for all will require a 10-year plan including ambitious tax reform that supports growth and fairness, a new framework for a modern and competitive workplace relations system, and a pathway to a meaningful budget surplus."" 

Read more 

The need for tax reform was echoed by Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Kate Carnell and Financial Services Council chief Sally Loane. 

Mr Turnbull's willingness to compromise with political opponents could help get those reforms through. 

Ms Livingstone said Mr Turnbull needed to focus on building an innovative and future-skilled economy to help boost productivity so Australia maintains its high living standards and social safety net. 

The tech-savvy Mr Turnbull, who made millions from internet startup OzEmail in the 1990s, has regularly spoken on the importance of innovation. 

Ai Group chief executive Innes Willox called him ""a world-class advocate well able to restart our stalled national reform agenda"". 

Business confidence is fragile partly due to the instability of a fourth prime minister in 28 months. 

While some analysts believe Mr Turnbull's elevation to prime minister could help improve confidence, AMP chief economist Shane Oliver sounded a note of caution. 

""The change does nothing to alter the underlying fundamental challenge facing Australia, which is the end of the resources boom and the resultant sluggish economic growth,"" Dr Oliver said. 

""But it does have the potential to help."" 

IG market analyst Angus Nicholson said sentiment may improve after data last week showed consumer and business confidence dipping again. 

""Traditionally with conservative pro-finance, pro-business leaders, which I think Mr Turnbull is regarded among the investor community, you often see a boost in consumer and investor confidence,"" he said. 

""If it does provide a boost to confidence, that can also boost the real economy."" 

Mr Turnbull's negotiations with the then Labor government to secure passage of an emissions trading scheme directly led to his toppling as opposition leader by Mr Abbott in 2009, but analysts have downplayed concerns over his stance on climate. 

""The Abbott government position on climate change even in the business community has been somewhat unpopular,"" Mr Nicholson said. 

""Big companies like Shell have clearly seen the need to divest into renewables and diversify and invest in clean coal, so I don't think change on climate policy would be a deal breaker with the business community. 

""The key thing is there needs to be proper discussion and consideration. The worst thing they could do would be sudden change.""",c98dae8b-4e66-40e8-b5d1-e6359fb394f2,News,2015-09-15T08:21:41Z,Geelong Advertiser,By Stuart Condie Liberals Economy: Industry bodies warm to Turnbull's ways,0.0,News
3724,"HUNSTVILLE, AL (WAFF) - 

Minutes before Bentley signing the budget he told reporters he's going to go out of his way to support those who voted yes.

But where does that leave four North Alabama districts whose state senators openly opposed raising your taxes?

“They may need something in their district,” said Bentley. “I'm just saying we help our friends.""

Strong words from Governor Robert Bentley minutes before he signed off on the 2016 budget. The Governor didn’t hold back his feelings for those who supported it.

""I'm just saying that we are going to go out of our way to help our friends who are helping the people of Alabama,"" said Bentley. 

Presumably not on that friend's list, ‘The group of 9’ Alabama State Senators, four of which from North Alabama. They include Paul Bussman of Cullman, Bill Holtzclaw of Madison, Paul Sanford of Huntsville, and Clay Scofield of Arab. All nine voted against raising taxes. ""I think it would be very unwise to punish the people of the ninth district because their state senator made a principled stand for long term budget reforms,"" said Senator Scofield. 

Scofield told us he voiced his concerns about the budget to Bentley's staff throughout the process so his vote shouldn't have surprised anyone.

Senator Holtzclaw is no stranger to controversy with Governor Bentley. Earlier this year, Holtzclaw took out a billboard criticizing Bentley's tax plan. The Alabama Department of Transportation then pulled millions of dollars in road funds away from Holtzclaw's district. Here's how the governor defended his actions on February 27.

""We have serious problems in this state. And for a state Senator to be critical of solutions to a problem that truly exists before he has even seen any of the solutions is irresponsible. And the people of Alabama deserve better than that,"" said Bentley.

Holtzclaw fired back at the Governor days later.

""It is unimaginable that these projects would be suspended in retaliation for me informing constituents of my position,"" said Holtzclaw in March. Bentley did tell reporters on Thursday he's not saying he's going to hurt anyone. What that means for the people in those nine districts remains to be seen.

231,"This week’s cool, crisp mornings have reminded me that apples are officially in season in North Carolina, with the harvest continuing through October. 
  
North Carolina is the seventh largest apple-producing state in the nation. The state’s apple crop is mostly grown in four regions around Cleveland, Haywood, Henderson and Wilkes counties, according to the N.C. Department of Agriculture. 
      
Growing up in Asheville, I have fond memories of apple picking in Henderson County, the largest apple-producing county in the state. 
 
Each fall, my family took the short drive to Stepp’s Hillcrest Orchard, a fourth generation working farm just northeast of Hendersonville. The Stepp family has been inviting guests to pick their own apples for 45 years at its “U-Pick Apple Orchard.” 
 
A not-so-fond memory from my childhood involves the crabapple, the only native North American apple variety. A large crabapple tree in our backyard frequently shed the small, sour fruit across our yard. Perhaps the most dreaded of our chores, my brother and I were responsible for picking up the often-rotten crabapples scattered in the grass before my parents mowed the lawn or hosted a backyard party. 
 
There are plenty of apple orchards to visit in Wilkes County this fall. To see a list, visit www.visitwilkesboronc.com/explore/attractions/orchards . 
 
Even if you can’t make it to an apple-picking orchard, there are plenty of other ways to savor fall’s sweetest flavor in the coming weeks. 
 
Just around the corner, the Brushy Mountain Apple Festival will be Oct. 3 in downtown North Wilkesboro. From 8 a.m.-5 p.m., you can enjoy mountain heritage exhibits, music, crafts and food—including, of course, a bounty of apple products. 
 
Below are a few recipes (two sweet, one savory) that highlight the fruit. 
 
Apple crumb pie 
 
2/3 cup sugar 
 
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 
 
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
 
6-8 apples, pared, cored and sliced (6 cups) 
 
1 9-inch unbaked pastry shell 
 
1/2 cup all-purpose flour 
 
1/4 cup sugar 
 
1/4 cup cold butter 
 
Combine first 3 ingredients; stir into apples. Turn apple mixture into pastry shell. Combine remaining flour and sugar, and cut in butter until crumbly. Sprinkle over apples. Bake at 400 degrees for 45 to 50 minutes or until done. If pie shell browns too quickly, cover the edge with foil. 
 
Apple cheddar sage frittata 
 
8 eggs 
 
1 tablespoon milk or cream 
 
1 tablespoon butter 
 
2 shallots, thinly sliced 
 
4 ounces pancetta (or bacon) finely diced 
 
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 
 
1 red apple, cored and diced 
 
4 ounces cheddar cheese, in small cubes 
 
1 tablespoon sage, finely chopped, plus extra whole leaves for topping 
 
Salt and pepper to taste 
 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees 
 
In a bowl, beat eggs with milk, salt and pepper. Set aside. 
 
Heat a cast iron skillet on medium heat. Melt butter and add shallots, cook for 2 minutes. Add pancetta and cook another 2 minutes. Add diced apple. Cover skillet and cook until apples begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add cinnamon and stir to combine. Spread shallot, apple and pancetta mixture evenly throughout skillet. Add egg mixture. Cover and cook without disturbing 6 minutes or until edges begin to set. Sprinkle with chopped sage and diced cheddar. 
 
Transfer skillet to oven and bake 7-9 minutes so the eggs can finish setting. Serve directly from skillet. Serves 6-8. 
 
Italian apple torta (torta di mele) 
 
1 cup butter 
 
4 golden delicious apples 
 
2 1/4 cups flour 
 
1 tablespoon baking powder 
 
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 
 
1/2 teaspoon salt 
 
4  large eggs 
 
1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
 
1 cup sugar 
 
1 tablespoon amaretto liqueur 
 
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest 
 
4 tablespoons butter, melted 
 
3 tablespoons sugar 
 
Whisk together flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon and set aside. 
 
In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat at medium speed for 3 minutes until mixture is pale yellow in color, creamy and thick. Turn speed down and gradually add flour mixture. Add lemon zest, vanilla and amaretto until blended; increase speed to medium for 2 more minutes. 
 
Peel, quarter, core and slice apples into 1/2-inch-wide slices. Cut half of the apple slices into small chunks and fold them into batter. 
 
Pour batter into a buttered and floured 9-inch springform pan. Arrange remaining apples slices, core side down, on top of the batter in circles over the entire surface with edges slightly overlapping. The apple arrangement should resemble a flower in full bloom. 
 
Brush apples and batter with melted butter and generously sprinkle with the remaining 3 tablespoons sugar. 
 
Place in center of oven and bake at 350 degrees for 70-90 minutes, until cake pulls away from sides of pan and the top of the cake is golden brown. 
 
Remove from oven and allow to cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes, then remove sides of the springform pan and cool cake completely. 
 
Dust powdered sugar with cinnamon all over the cake.",9fc6e7f3-dda9-4970-b0c8-881407543c55,News,2015-09-18T18:22:11Z,Wilkes Journal Patriot,Cooking with N.C. apples,0.0,Blog

More and more employers today want, or even expect, college grads to have had one or more internships during their college career. If internships are not a formal part of your college or university curriculum, you will need to find them on your own. And this means knowing not only where to look but how to look for an internship that will give you the experience you need. 
 
Finding an Internship that is Right for You 
 
Do a Serious Reality Check 
 
Once you decide to do an internship, don’t simply start applying to any internship you see advertised on the Internet. Ask yourself some clarifying questions that will help lead you to the right experience: 
 How much time do you have to devote to the internship? A semester? A summer? Part of the school day?  Realistically, will you be able to relocate to do an internship or will you need to be within commuting distance from where you live?  Is money an issue? Then think about costs of relocating and supporting yourself away from your school or home. Remember, many internships are not paid or are low-paying. You are doing your internship to get real-world experience that employers value. It’s an investment in your future.  Is the internship you want really available? Was the application due six months ago? Are 50 people on the waiting list already? Be careful of those internships advertised on the Internet. It just means that hundreds or even thousands of students might be applying.  
Think Locally 
 
Everyone thinks about the big brand-name companies like Google, Apple and the major consumer brands. While an internship at any one of these companies would be great, there are many companies closer to home that can give you a quality internship experience. 
 
Research your area. Look for names you know but also look for names you may not be familiar with. Many local companies are owned by larger national and international corporate parents. And these local companies would be good to contact because they may already have established internship programs for college students. 
 
Don’t forget to research non-profits. Large non-profits not only can offer you a community-service element to your internship but can give you good business experience in budgeting, fundraising, marketing and public relations. 
 
Check out your immediate community for local opportunities. Talk to the Chamber of Commerce, Better Business Bureau, Rotary Clubs and your local government offices. You’ll be surprised how many people will be willing to help you find an internship. 
 
Make the Most of Your Internship 
 
Employers want to hire people who have had some real-world experience. They are less interested in the name of the company or organization that you interned with but with what you’ve learned and accomplished. You can make the most of your internship if you: 
 Keep a record of what you did. This will help you remember the details so you can be specific about your experience in any job interview.  Show that you were willing to take on new tasks. Employers want people who have initiative.  Show how your internship linked to your academic learning. Even if your internship was not in your major field of study, show how you problem-solved and found creative solutions to real world issues.  Show how you worked in a team. Teamwork is critical in today’s organizations.  Update your resume with what you’ve accomplished.  
College internships today have become very competitive. But don’t be put off. If you take the time to think about what could work for you, do the research and then step up and make the most of your internship, you’ll wow any potential employer. Be active, be positive and make the most of your experience

4953,"Epilepsy sufferers may find relief from seizures thanks to a chemical found in marijuana, but the nation’s drug laws are preventing doctors from conducting important research. 
 
Cannabidiol, an active ingredient in marijuana that doesn’t get smokers high, has been proven to prevent epilepsy seizures, but researchers are having difficulty conducting large scale studies , according to a study published by WebMD . 
 
Even though four states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana and 23 other states have eased restrictions, cannabis remains a Schedule 1 controlled substance by the Drug Enforcement Agency. The federal government considers marijuana to have no redeeming medical value. 
 
Those restrictive laws are hindering scientists’ research into anti-seizure marijuana drugs Dr. Daniel Friedman, a neurologist and epilepsy specialist at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City told WebMD . 
 
While we don’t know all of the long-term and short-term side effects of using cannabis and cannabidiol, we do know the impact of uncontrolled epilepsy, and that must be considered when looking at the use of cannabis. 
 
Many epilepsy patients can control their disease with diet and one of the 20 different existing drugs, but 30 percent of epilepsy sufferers still suffer from seizures, each of which causes loss of cognitive functions, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution . 
 
In the United States about 1 in 26 people will develop some type of seizure related epilepsy disorder, a central nervous system disorder characterized by brain cell disruption, according to the Mayo Clinic. 
 
Some states, like Texas, have legalized the use of cannabis oil for epilepsy patients like 5-year-old Hanna who was diagnosed with epilepsy when she was 11 months old. 
 
Her father, Tim McMorris, told KXAN-TV the family had tried every conventional medicine on the market with no success. 
 
Hearing her doctor say that we are on the last medication, that this is pretty much the last straw for her. It really starts sinking on kind of hopelessness almost. 
 
About two out of every five patients who received compassionate waivers from the government allowing them to use cannabis oil have experienced less frequent seizures. 
 
Cannabis oil isn’t the same as medical marijuana; patients can’t get high from it. Its sole purpose is to ease the suffering of epilepsy patients and prevent seizures. 
 
More clinical trials and research studies are needed, however, to determine medical strategies, effective treatment and discover any harmful side effects.

139,"The fuel economy and smog ratings are shown on the sticker price of a 2015 Passat limited edition vehicle at a Volkswagen dealership in Escondido, California, September 21, 2015. — Reuters pic FRANKFURT, Sept 22 — German auto giant Volkswagen’s shares plummeted nearly 20 per cent yesterday as investigations spread into revelations that hundreds of thousands of its diesel cars have software that secretly thwarts US pollution tests. 
 
Volkswagen, the world’s largest automaker by sales in the first half of this year, said it had halted all diesel vehicle sales in the United States during a probe into the scandal, which could lead to fines of more than US$18 billion (RM76.786 billion). 
 
In addition to the environmental fines, US authorities have reportedly launched a criminal investigation into the company. 
 
According to the US authorities, VW admitted that it had equipped about 482,000 cars in the US with sophisticated software that covertly turns off pollution controls when the car is being driven and turns them on only when it detects that the car is undergoing an emissions test. 
 
With the so-called “defeat device” deactivated, the car can spew pollutant gases into the air, including nitrogen oxide in amounts as much as 40 per cent higher than emissions standards, said the US Environmental Protection Agency, which announced the allegations Friday along with California authorities. 
 
“Using a defeat device in cars to evade clean air standards is illegal, and a threat to public health,” said Cynthia Giles, enforcement officer at the EPA. 
 
In Germany, currently hosting the Frankfurt motor show vaunting the industry’s strengths and environmental credentials, the government launched an investigation into whether Volkswagen or other carmakers are doing anything similar in Germany or Europe. 
 
Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt told the Bild daily that he had asked Germany’s Federal Motor Transport Authority “to immediately have specific and extensive tests conducted on all Volkswagen diesel models by independent experts.” 
 
South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said that authorities there, too, would conduct emissions tests on three Volkswagen car models in mid-October to check for similar deception. 
 
Beyond the potential fines and lawsuits, and the billions of euros that evaporated in Volkswagen’s stock market value as its shares plunged 18.19 per cent to €133 (RM635), wiping out more than US$15 billion, the company faces a potentially crippling blow to its reputation. 
 
 Criminal probe launched 
 
The vehicles affected are four-cylinder VW and Audi diesel cars in the US built since 2008. 
 
In addition to the EPA’s probe, the US Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation into the German automaker’s alleged violation of US air pollution laws, according to media reports yesterday. 
 
First reported by Bloomberg, the criminal probe piles more pressure on VW. 
 
Contacted by AFP, neither the Justice Department nor Volkswagen chose to comment on the probe. 
 
The EPA said that the agency had not issued a formal recall for the VW vehicles but expects to “compel” the company to issue a recall to reduce the emissions impacts of those vehicles. 
 
“Depending on the complexity of the repair and the lead time needed to obtain the necessary components, it could take up to one year to identify corrective actions, develop a recall plan, and issue recall notices,” the US agency said. 
 
The EPA also said yesterday that it will screen for defeat devices in other manufacturers’ diesel vehicles currently on the road, though declined to identify the automakers whose vehicles will be tested. 
 
 Deeply sorry 
 
VW chief executive Martin Winterkorn issued an apology Sunday, vowing that the group would cooperate with authorities and ordering an external investigation of its own into the matter. 
 
“The board of management takes these findings very seriously. I personally am deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public. We will cooperate fully with the responsible agencies, with transparency and urgency, to clearly, openly and completely establish all of the facts of this case,” Winterkorn said. 
 
“We at Volkswagen will do everything that must be done in order to re-establish the trust that so many people have placed in us, and we will do everything necessary in order to reverse the damage this has caused. This matter has first priority for me, personally, and for our entire board of management,” Winterkorn said. 
 
Christian Stadler of Warwick Business School said there was “no question that this is a big problem for Volkswagen and could lead to CEO Winterkorn losing his job after all.” 
 
Winterkorn, 68, has been chief executive since 2007, but clashed with other leadership earlier this year. 
 
 Image damaged 
 
Stefan Bratzel, director at the Center for Automotive Management, a research group, said the damage to VW’s image would be as great as the financial fines. 
 
Another leading German auto expert, Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, agreed.  
 
“It will be tough for VW to regain its credibility in the United States after this incident,” he said. 
 
In the US, Edmunds.com analyst Jessica Caldwell said “it is in Volkswagen’s best interest to publicly address steps to fix this mess as soon as possible before it loses its customer base for good.” 
 
German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel expressed confidence that VW would clear up the matter quickly and thoroughly.  
 
And he insisted the reputation of “Made in Germany” technology would not be tarnished. — AFP",d86e447d-da83-4cc3-80b1-6dc3b561ee8f,News,2015-09-22T00:38:00Z,Malay Mail,Criminal probe: Volkswagen slams into huge false emission scam,0.0,News

Will the VMAs drama ever end? 

Pink isn't feeling red in the face after comments she allegedly made on a private Instagram went public. The 35-year-old singer-songwriter made headlines Thursday after she reportedly weighed in on the  earlier that week, confessing to a fan she felt ""embarrassed,"" ""sad"" and ""old"" while watching this year's show. ""In all seriousness; I felt sad because music is supposed to inspire. It saved my life. This trash won't save any kids life. In a world that is even scarier and with lives still worth saving, who will stand up and have soul?"" she asked. ""Disenfranchised to say the least. Let down by my industry and peers."" 

Pink then name-dropped a few acts, writing, ""Beside Macklemore and Pharrell and [ Justin ] Bieber (pre-sob fest) and The Weeknd , Tori Kelly was dope too. The rest was gross and embarrassing and hard for this aging pop star to believe."" 

E! News reached out to Pink's rep to confirm or clarify her comments Thursday. 
 Kevin Mazur/MTV1415/WireImage   
Right or wrong, many people assumed the ""Just Give Me a Reason"" singer was slamming host Miley Cyrus , as well as performers and pop peers Iggy Azalea , Demi Lovato , Nicki Minaj and Taylor Swift , as she didn't offer them any praise. 

Publicly, Pink trashed the annual awards show, , ""I'm convinced MTV just bought up all dispensaries before airing this show."" Pink did give props to one performer, though, , ""Ok @ToriKelly - fan for life. Great freaking performance tonight, you live singing, guitar playing accapella sanging woman."" 

After her alleged Instagram comments made the rounds, Pink defended herself via  that night. ""Please look for a feud elsewhere. I have no issue with Demi Lovato or anyone else. I actually forgot she performed. I have opinions. MANY,"" she told her followers, , ""I stand by what I said. However, I didn't intend for the angry people of the world to latch on and make it into something it isn't. Peace."" 

Pink then retweeted several supportive messages:

2462,"By Reid McCarter 
 
September 1 st will see the release of the final Metal Gear game directed by Kojima Productions’ Hideo Kojima. Barring an incredible surprise, the creator of the long-running stealth/action series will be moving on to new projects, completely divorced from the universe he’s lead development on for close to 30 years. 
 
This isn’t the first time Kojima has announced plans to abandon Metal Gear . As far back as the launch of 2001’s Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty , the designer has told press he wants to leave the series behind. Four sequels later, it finally seems Kojima is truly moving on. Unfortunately, his departure doesn’t seem to be on great terms, publisher Konami having stripped Kojima’s name from Metal Gear Solid V:  The Phantom Pain ’s cover art (and, even more bizarrely, forthcoming reprints of some of the previous games). While Konami has released confusing information claiming Kojima will still be involved in future Metal Gear titles, rumours suggest he’s already split from the publisher. 
 
Combined with Konami’s apparent pivot toward non-console videogame development following corporate restructuring earlier this year, the future of Metal Gear seems pretty dire. Even if the publisher does appoint a new development team to create another entry following The Phantom Pain ’s release, the question remains: would Metal Gear even work without its creator? 
 
There are very few videogame series that are tied so directly to their creative leads, but Metal Gear has always been one of them. From the first Metal Gear I played— Solid , back on the PlayStation One—it was impossible to separate the experience playing out onscreen with the developer responsible for its creation. This is made explicit at several points. A fourth wall-breaking fight against psychic villain Psycho Mantis pauses the action to display a fake TV input screen with HIDEO in place of the usual VIDEO in Metal Gear Solid.  Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes goes so far as to allow the player to rescue a digitally recreated Kojima from an interrogation camp. But, more than these outright winks, the tone of the series is the direct result of its writer/director’s development sensibilities. 
 
Metal Gear has garnered both admiration and criticism for its trademark design choices. There’s the long-winded character dialogue that finds ways to cover everything from world history and cultural theory to cinema and junior high-level jokes. There’s the exhaustive attention to detail that sees Solid Snake popping cold medicine to treat a cold or sneak through a swamp by wearing a costume alligator’s head. And, crucially, there’s the tightrope walk between serious war drama and slapstick cartoon that every game manages to navigate without veering too far in either direction. 
 
Trying to imitate all of this without Kojima’s input seems like a tricky feat. It also makes it hard to imagine that a Metal Gear developed without its original creator’s involvement would feel like a real continuation of the series. This obviously overlooks the fact that Hideo Kojima is not the sole creative force behind the series. Kojima Productions is made up of more than a single person—some of whom have been around since the earliest titles. But, given that the same rumours regarding Kojima’s split from Konami state that many other senior members of the team are also set to depart, there aren’t likely to be many left from the core Metal Gear team to assume creative leadership. 
 
The dramatic, public manner by which Kojima Productions seems to have dissolved—and, more importantly, information regarding the poor working conditions development teams at Konami’s Japanese offices face—mean that many may not be interested in purchasing another Metal Gear regardless of its direction. Still, the larger question is whether or not a game made with new creative talent would even feel like a natural extension of the previous titles. 
 
Too often, videogames are thought of as products and not the result of real people creating work that results from their own unique personalities and artistic sensibilities. Though publishers may own the rights to series like Metal Gear , there’s no way to own the process that goes into their development. Without Hideo Kojima and the team at Kojima Productions, Konami won’t be able to replicate what’s made the games they own so popular in the first place. A new studio may be able to create something new—possibly something just as good as what came before—but without the involvement of an original work’s creators, it can’t ever be the same.

333,"Two fraudsters who laundered £2.6 million meant for a new Channel Island airport runway have been sent to prison. 
 
John Woodhatch, aged 58, of Boleyn Court in Buckhurst Hill, was sent to prison for five years for his part in a “payment diversion” fraud on the States of Guernsey. 
 
Adrian Taylor, 44, from Swanley in Kent, was also jailed for six years when the pair appeared at the Old Bailey last Wednesday (September 9) having both pleaded guilty to money laundering. 
 
The duo contacted the Guernsey Treasury in June 2012 claiming to be from Lagan Construction, which is carrying out a £50 million project at the island’s airport. 
 
The pair told the treasury that they wanted to change the bank account details into which monthly payments were being made. 
 
Once this was agreed and the latest monthly payment of £2.6 million had been transferred into the new RBS account, Woodhatch, who was working as a City broker, immediately instructed the bank to move the funds to accounts in Dubai and Turkey. 
 
Woodhatch told RBS the transfers were mainly to pay for a horse in Dubai, but the bank’s money laundering team was not convinced and referred the matter to the City of London Police in July 2012. 
 
After several days, Woodhatch was arrested and his home and commercial address in the city were searched. 
 
A review of the accounts found that £52,000 of the stolen funds had been transferred to Taylor, who was arrested in October 2012 after he handed himself in to police. 
 
Detective Inspector Rob Stirling, who led the investigation for the City of London Police, said: 
 
“Woodhatch and Taylor thought they were too smart to be caught and would be left free to spend the £2.6 million stolen from the States of Guernsey. 
   
 Share article  
   
“Unfortunately for them the City of London Police specialises in investigating cases of financial fraud and bringing those responsible to justice. 
 
“Woodhatch and Taylor’s scam should also serve as a warning to other public and private sector bodies that could easily be targeted by fraudsters in the same way.”",a74ac0a8-5bc3-49ae-a585-9d614f0d5555,News,2015-09-14T10:24:07Z,Surrey Comet,Fraudsters jailed for £2.6m Channel Island airport scam,0.0,Blog

9694,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – September 11, 2015 – (RealEstateRama) — National Association of Realtors® President Chris Polychron testified before the U.S. House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet at a hearing entitled “Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: Commercial Applications and Public Policy Implications.” NAR testified on the growing interest in the use of drones, their commercial application in the real estate industry, and Realtor® perspectives on legislative and regulatory efforts to advance safe drone use in the commercial space. “Commercial use of unmanned aircraft systems, or UASs, has the potential to create new jobs and businesses specializing in their uses,” Polychron said in testimony before the subcommittee. “NAR and its members are excited about these possibilities but also understand the need to balance them with protecting the privacy and safety of citizens and other users of the country’s National Air Space. As end-users of drone technology, Realtors® want clear regulation that permits the commercial application of UASs in a way that is affordable to users and safe for their communities, both on the ground and in the air.” NAR has been working closely with the Federal Aviation Administration and others to advance a responsible approach to commercial drone use. To that end, NAR joined the “Know Before you Fly” campaign earlier this year and is a part of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration’s “Multistakeholder Process: Unmanned Aircraft Systems,” a working group on privacy as it relates to the use of drones. In his testimony, NAR President Chris Polychron applauded the House Judiciary Subcommittee for its attention to this issue. “Realtors® have shown a consistent interest in the safe, responsible use of drones in the business of real estate, and I appreciate Chairman Darrell Issa and Ranking Member Jerrold Nadler for giving us the opportunity to share that perspective,” he said. “We look forward to a continued partnership with the committee as our work on this important issue moves forward.” Although wide-scale commercial use of drones is currently prohibited, the FAA has worked to streamline a waiver process for individuals and businesses interested in using drones. So far, the FAA has issued over 1,300 such waivers. A significant percentage of those waivers have gone to users in the real estate business. The National Association of Realtors®, “The Voice for Real Estate,” is America’s largest trade association, representing over 1.1 million members involved in all aspects of the residential and commercial real estate industries.

Ultramarines vs Tau Empire.
The Tau Empire, ever determined to recapture their lost territory have returned to T'Lau. Tha Tau were successful in inflicting severe casualties upon the defenders which allowed them to capture a number of strategic locations and give themselves a safe landing site far from enemy artillery. The attack lasted for over a month with the Astra Militarum being constantly on the backfoot. Already weakened and exhausted from recent attacks on the planet they were ill equipped to handle such a large scale invasion.
Then suddenly and expected, a storm of drop pods descended from the skies into the heart of the Tau command. Battle brothers from the Ultramarines chapter emerged and engaged the Tau. Elsewhere they deployed via thunderhawk transports to the outer defences of the Imperial defenders. While the veterans sought to slay the alien leadership, these new arrivals launched attacks into the outer lines. Confusion and panic spread throughout the Tau military and they retreated back towards their command. The Ultramarines pursued, never giving the xenos the chance to regroup or resupply. When the Tau commander fell, slain in single combat with the Ultramarines captain, the Tau lines collapsed. The Astra Militarum then moved in to mop up the stragglers and routed fire warriors. It took the Ultramarines several more swift strikes to finish off the last Tau present on T'Lau but their attempted invasion failed but they would return.",4985482e-8592-455e-8ede-a36dad43aaac,Blog,2015-09-07T19:08:59Z,40K Midas Crusade,The Tau Strike Back - T'Lau,1.0,Blog

On Sept. 12, 2015 – Feast of the Holy Name of Mary – Archbishop Ramon Arguelles of the Archdiocese of Lipa has issued a Decree that declares ‘Our Lady’s Apparition in Lipa Carmel as worthy of belief and do exhibit ‘ supernatural origin.’ It acknowledges Mary as “Mediatrix of all Grace.” 
 
It also states that the nun “Teresita Castillo” and other nuns among them our very own the late “Mother Therese” (Foundress of The Daughters of Mary Mother of the Church) have suffered endless humiliation and now comes their much-awaited vindication. 
 
My father, the late Dr. Floro V. Dabu and my mother Josefa Dabu were close friends and benefactors of Mother Therese and  the Nuns. 
 
Mother Therese has revealed to my parents – of Our Lady’s appearance to her too and  that Our Lady spoke to her as well. She was also a witness to the shower of roses in and around the convent and inside the church. 
 
After the setback at Lipa Carmel - Our Lady has found a home - the Archdiocese of Caceres - where the Daughters of Mary Mother of the Church came to be.

1537,"The paper is dealing with two important subclasses of plateaued functions: bent and semi-bent functions.
In the first part of the paper, we construct mainly bent and semi-bent functions in the Maiorana-McFarland class using Boolean functions having linear structures (linear translators) systematically. Although most of these results are rather direct applications of some recent results, using linear structures (linear translators) allows us to have certain flexibilities to control extra properties of these plateaued functions. In the second part of the paper, using the results of the first part and exploiting these flexibilities, we modify many secondary constructions. Therefore, we obtain new secondary constructions of bent and semi-bent functions not belonging to the Maiorana-McFarland class. Instead of using bent (semi-bent) functions as ingredients, our secondary constructions use only Boolean (vectorial Boolean) functions with linear structures (linear translators) which are very easy to choose. Moreover, all of them are very explicit and we also determine the duals of the bent functions in our constructions. We show how these linear structures should be chosen in order to satisfy the corresponding conditions coming from using derivatives and quadratic/cubic functions in our secondary constructions.",998abfa5-33a7-485c-92d4-a272a2c2a8ff,Blog,2015-09-13T20:12:54Z,Cryptology ePrint Archive,"Bent and semi-bent functions via linear translators , by N.

He was hurt when he was sacked and slammed to the turf late in the third quarter against the Eagles.  X-rays on the shoulder found the collarbone to be broken.  Romo later returned to the sidelines with his arm in a sling.  The Cowboys are already without top wide receiver Dez Bryant, who is out for at least a month with a broken foot.  Dallas hosts Atlanta in Week Three.  Both are  2-and-0.

New games, new modes.  By Sega and Sports Interactive have announced three new Football Manager games that are scheduled for release this year. 
 
As expected, Football Manager 2016 will be coming out on PC and Mac, but Football Manager Touch will also be coming out for PC and tablets. Previously known as Football Manager Classic, Touch is the quick play mode which has been within the full game before (and for tablets since March). This is the first time it will be available separately through Steam and on tablets. Football Manager Mobile will also be coming to all iOS and Android devices. 
 
“For some time now it’s been clear to us that there is no ‘one size fits all’ football management experience,” says Sports Interactive head Miles Jacobson. ""The introduction of Football Manager Touch as a standalone offering – playable across computer and tablet – means that we now offer something for everyone.” 
 
As for new features, FM2016 now includes a create-a-club mode, and a fantasy draft mode where you compete with other managers to build a squad from scratch with a fixed budget, followed by a mini-league. Other tweaks and additions include more manager customization options, a set piece creator, more realistic injuries, extended press interaction, and improved AI transfers. 
 
FM Touch will also have the create-a-club mode, and it will have cross-save, so a career saved to the cloud can be accessed on your tablet or your PC. 
 
Pre-ordering FM2016 from participating retailers will also grant you a key for An Alternative Reality: the Football Manager Documentary. Additionally, you'll gain access to the full beta two weeks before the game launches. 
 
The full Football Manager 2016 is scheduled for release on November 13, with Football Manager Touch and Mobile available ""before Christmas."" 
 
In IGN's review of last year's Football Manager 2015 , we said that ""better menu layouts, countless new options and improved match-day features see FM2015 remain in title-winning form.""

2850,"(September 02, 2015) CALGARY, Alberta, Sept. 2, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --Pembina Pipeline Corporation (""Pembina"" or ""the Company"") (TSX: PPL; NYSE: PBA) is pleased to announce that it has commissioned several key growth projects within its Gas Services and Conventional Pipeline businesses, placing approximately $650 million assets into service. Additionally, Pembina is providing an update on other key growth projects on-going across its business.

""I am proud of the work Pembina employees have done to commission such large scale energy infrastructure projects,"" said Mick Dilger, Pembina's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""I am also very pleased to advise that a large portion of these projects were placed into service on-time and under budget. Further, and most importantly, was the exemplary safety record that was maintained across all of these projects from construction through to commissioning.""

Gas Services Pembina's Gas Services business successfully commissioned 260 million cubic feet per day (""MMcf/d"") of new processing capacity and pipeline infrastructure in Alberta and Saskatchewan for a combined capital investment of approximately $320 million, which represents a seven percent savings versus the original project budget. 

In late August, Pembina safely commissioned its Saturn II facility, a 200 MMcf/d 'twin' of the Company's existing Saturn I Facility (""Saturn II""),ahead of schedule and under budget. Saturn II is an example of recognizing value achieved through leveraging an existing 'Pembina template' design, which supported the successful and safe execution of this project. Further demonstrating the benefits of the Company's integrated service offering, the natural gas liquids (""NGL"") volumes produced at Saturn II will also be transported on Pembina's Peace Pipeline system and will be fractionated at Pembina's Redwater facility. 

Pembina's Saskatchewan Ethane Extraction plant (""SEEP"") was commissioned in late August. SEEP was acquired as part of the Vantage Pipeline acquisition which closed in October of 2014. This facility has a deep cut processing capacity of 60 MMcf/d and ethane plus fractionation capabilities which supports up to approximately 4,500 barrels per day (""bpd"") of ethane extraction. The ethane volumes produced at SEEP will be transported under a long-term, fee-for-service agreement on Pembina's Vantage Pipeline. This project was successfully and safely completed on-time and under budget. 

Additionally, Pembina placed into service the gathering pipeline associated with the 100 MMcf/d Resthaven Expansion project (the ""Resthaven Expansion""). This project consists of a 12 inch diameter 28 kilometer pipeline with capacity to deliver 100 MMcf/d that will connect a customer's condensate recovery plant into Pembina's Resthaven facility. In advance of the expected in-service of the Resthaven Expansion, this newly commissioned pipeline will be able to provide additional gas volumes for Pembina's existing Resthaven facility. Construction of the Resthaven Expansion is underway and is expected be in-service by mid-2016. Once the Resthaven Expansion is complete, the facility's gross gas processing capacity will increase to 300 MMcf/d.

With the Saturn II and SEEP facilities in-service, Pembina's Gas Services capacity has increased 26 percent from 1,003 MMcf/d to 1,263 MMcf/d. ""This additional capacity supports Pembina in becoming one of Canada's largest third party gas processors,"" said Jaret Sprott, Pembina's Vice President, Gas Services. ""These plants provide increased exposure to attractive Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin multi-zone geology and represents Pembina's entry into Saskatchewan's prolific Bakken resource play."" 

Conventional Pipelines 

At the beginning of September, Pembina commissioned the high vapour pressure (""HVP""), or NGL, portion of the Peace and Northern Phase II pipeline expansion (""Phase II HVP""), and expects to have the pipeline fully commissioned by the end of 2015. In conjunction with the low vapour pressure (""LVP""), or crude oil and condensate portion of the expansion that was placed into service in April of this year (""Phase II LVP""), the Peace and Northern Phase II pipeline expansion (the ""Phase II Expansion"") is now in-service. In aggregate, the Phase II Expansion and all associated laterals represents an approximately $670 million of capital investment, of which approximately $330 million is attributable to the Phase II HVP project and approximately $340 million is attributable to the Phase II LVP project. The Phase II Expansion is underpinned by 5 to 10 year contracts with substantial take-or-pay commitments from approximately 40 customers. The Phase II Expansion is expected to increase Peace and Northern systems' capacity by 108,000 bpd in aggregate. As a result of commissioning the Phase II Expansion, total capacity in Pembina's Conventional Pipeline business will increase by 15 percent to approximately 830,000 bpd. ""These expansions provide much needed hydrocarbon liquids transportation capacity for the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin,"" said Jason Wiun, Pembina's Vice President, Conventional Pipelines. ""Pembina is well positioned to support future production growth through our existing asset base and through our committed growth projects that have significant embedded expansion potential.""

""With the commissioning of Phase II Expansion, including the LVP portion placed into service in April, and the approximately $320 million of new Gas Service's assets, this represents approximately $1 billion of new fee-for-service supported infrastructure,"" said Scott Burrows, Pembina's Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer.""This large scale investment helps to continue to grow Pembina's low risk fee-for-service asset base and demonstrates the value associated with Pembina's sector leading secured growth portfolio.""

Project Updates

In the coming months, Pembina will be commissioning a number of projects in its NGL Midstream business. Early in 2016, Pembina plans to commission the twin of its existing 73,000 bpd ethane plus fractionator (""RFS II""). The completion of RFS II will further strengthen Pembina's position as Western Canada's largest owner of fractionation capacity. Additionally, in early 2016, a small scale debottlenecking initiative to modestly increase propane plus throughput capacity at Pembina's existing Redwater Fractionator is expected to be commissioned. Finally, at Pembina's Corunna site, construction and commissioning of new brine pond, storage, rail, and truck infrastructure is well under-way, the new assets are expected to be phased into service through the remainder of 2015 and early 2016.

Pembina would also like to provide an update for the regulatory process associated with the $220 million expansion to pipeline infrastructure in northeast British Columbia (""B.C."") (the ""NEBC Expansion Project""). On August 26th 2015, Pembina withdrew its application for an expedited environmental review by the B.C. Environmental Assessment Office (""B.C. E.A.O""). Pembina's application was withdrawn to ensure that all First Nations and public concerns are identified and fulsomely addressed. Pembina intends to file a project application with the B.C. E.A.O in late 2015 and will be proceeding with preparing an environmental assessment certificate through the B.C. environmental assessment process, both of which will help support the project moving forward successfully. The anticipated schedule for the NEBC Expansion Project remains unchanged with an expected in-service date of Q4 2017, subject to regulatory and environmental approvals.

6818,"McDonald's announced Tuesday its highly anticipated decision to serve breakfast all day at all U.S. locations starting this fall. 
 
According to CNBC , McDonald's franchisees voted to approve all-day breakfast at the fast food chain's 14,300 U.S. restaurants on Tuesday. Starting Oct. 6, patrons can order Egg McMuffins and other breakfast items at any time of the day. 
 
The Oak Brook, Illinois-based company tweeted about the decision Tuesday afternoon using the hashtag #AllDayBreakfast and responding to customers' queries about extending the chain's breakfast hours. McDonald's even responded to a tweet from 2007 that said, ""Mcdonalds should serve breakfast 24/7."" 
 
McDonald's began testing all-day breakfast in March in the San Diego market . The test was expected to expand to Nashville this summer. 
 
""Serving all-day breakfast is likely the number one request we hear from McDonald's customers,"" the company told NBC Chicago in a statement in July. 
 
McDonald's breakfast currently ends at 10:30 a.m. in most markets. 
 
The chain has long been the fast-food leader in the mornings, with its popular Sausage Biscuits, Hotcakes and other items pulling in roughly 20 percent of the company's U.S. sales. But McDonald's has faced stiffer competition in recent years, with competitors such as Starbucks and Subway rolling out breakfast sandwiches as well.

4932,"The lawsuit alleges the Honest Company falsely says its products are “natural.” It further says that Honest’s sunscreen isn’t “effective.” 

“The allegations against us are baseless and without merit.We strongly stand behind our products and theresponsibilitywe have to our consumers,” Alba said in a statement to CNNMoney. 

“I am very proud that we have built this company into an industry leader focused on using natural ingredients and developing products that people love,” she added. 

Earlier this year, the company vowed publicly to “do what it takes to make it right” after facing complaints for supposed problems with its sunscreen. 

Customers had taken to social media, posting pictures of sunburns they say they got wearing the Honest Company’s SPF 30. The company said the sunscreen is effective. 

The lawsuit was filed in federal court in California this week on behalf of one customer. 

Attorney Nicholas Carlsin said he would ask a judge to certify the suit as a class action, which means other customers with similar claims could participate in it. 

The complaint claims the Honest Company’s marketing and online messages are misleading, even as it vows to be “transparent.” 

“The ‘honestly FREE guarantee’ states: ‘Providing clear, credible, transparent information. No smoke and mirrors. No confusion,'” the suit states. 

The suit also cites a CNNMoney video interview from last month. In the interview, Honest Company CEO Brian Lee said he would “welcome” it if larger companies would ban the “1,200 chemicals we do not use in our products.” The video goes on to note that the Honest Company’s website lists only about 40 products that it says it excludes from its products.

4716,"An independent commission in the state of Missouri has released what it calls the ""people's report"" on the issues that it concludes ultimately led to riots last year after a Ferguson police officer killed unarmed Michael Brown . 
In nearly 200 pages of recommendations and conclusions, the commission not only targets police departments and court systems, but it analyzes broader societal and generational issues that the authors say must be addressed to make the state ""stronger, fairer"" for everyone. 

Among the issues addressed, the commission cites inequalities and ""unconscious bias"" at schools, and hunger throughout the state, where more than one out of every five children live in homes that have to worry about their next meal, according to the commission's report. 

 
""The effects of hunger can be severe and far-reaching,"" concludes the commission, announced in November by Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon to take a wide look at all the issues that many believe have contributed to tensions between police and the communities they serve. 
Sixteen  ""diverse volunteer leaders"" have now produced what they call ""an unflinching report"" that offers ""specific, practical policy recommendations."" 

The report calls on police departments to decrease their use of force, saying the state's attorney general should be put in charge of all investigations involving allegations of excessive force.

540,"An inexpensive way to make eating raw vegetables fun with this flavorful 6-ingredient kale pate and spread that’s low-FODMAP. No garlic or nuts! 
 
I’m thankful to have a handful of very close girlfriends that motivate me to be the best version of myself, help me see the world in a new way, and inspire me to do good for myself and those around me. Lesley (we call her Sprout) is one of these friends for me. Every time I see her, I leave feeling refueled and inspired. 
 

 
During my last visit, she reminded me of my love for herb pate (remember my Sweet Almond Pate from 4 years ago?). Every meal, Sprout served a bowl of fresh-cut veggies with oodles of mason jars filled with nut-free spreads adorned with little spoons. We were free to fill our plates with zucchini sticks, carrot sticks and cucumber rounds, then slather them in the various vegetable spreads she’d made fresh that morning. 
 

 
My vegetable intake skyrocketed that week! All I wanted to do was eat raw vegetables slathered in herb pate. And it goes beyond that. This pesto-like spread is great as a topping for roasted vegetable and meat bowls, a dip for plantain chips or added to scrambled eggs. 
 
Lesley graciously agreed to let me me share this recipe with you. She rarely measures anything; she has a knack for knowing exactly how to make something without needing to measure, so it took me a bit of time to recreate the recipe when I came home. After a couple of versions, this is the closest I could get to the real thing.

Ingredients   1 head (6 cups) green, purple or dino kale, chopped  1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil  ⅔ cup raw organic sesame seeds or hemp hearts  ⅔ cup extra-virgin olive oil or MCT oil  8 green onions, green part only  3 tablespoon apple cider vinegar  1 ¼ teaspoon grey sea salt      Instructions   Add chopped kale and 1 tablespoon olive oil to a cast iron pan and heat on low, covered, until slightly crispy, about 7 minutes.  Transfer to your high-powered blender or food processor with “S” blade .  Add remaining ingredients. Blend until smooth, using the blenders’ tamper to push the ingredients down to the blade.  Spoon into a mason jar and store in the fridge for 4-5 days.      Notes  FODMAP: to make even lower FODMAP, use less sesame seeds. You could go down to ¼ cup sesame seeds and an equal amount of oil.    3.3.3077

Begin by sauteing the kale in a cast iron pan with a tablespoon of olive oil. You could also use avocado oil here (and it’s more heat stable). Saute until crisp. 
 
Meanwhile, you could add the remaining ingredients into the blender. 
 

 
Once the kale is done, add it to the jug of your blender. Turn on and blend until smooth. I like it a little chunky, so I didn’t let it get too smooth.

It’s about creating balance, a healthy relationship with your body and healing ourselves. Yeah, weight loss will likely come as a result, but it’s not the main focus. Why? Because 95% of the women I’ve worked with in the last year were so focused on losing weight that they lost sight of taking care of their bodies and in turn, couldn’t lose weight to save their life.

4530,"Wales are poised to end their 58-year wait to play at a major tournament after Gareth Bale's late winner on a balmy night in Nicosia. 
 
Bale struck eight minutes from time - his sixth goal in seven games in Euro 2016 qualifying - when he met Jazz Richards' cross with a thumping header to give Cyprus goalkeeper Antonis Georgallides no chance. 
 
The 1-0 triumph puts Wales within touching distance of a place at next summer's European Championship in France - a feat that would be confirmed by beating Israel in Cardiff on Sunday night. 
 
But in warm conditions and on a difficult hard surface, it was anything but easy for Wales, who had to grind out a victory as precious as any in recent times. 
 
Wales started the day in buoyant mood, having moved above England in the FIFA rankings for the first time in their history; they ended it by completing their best ever run in competitive fixtures without defeat - nine games. 
 
Both sides carried moments of danger in a high-energy start, but it was Wales who had the first opportunity when Bale drew defenders for Aaron Ramsey to fire just over the crossbar from 18 yards. 
 
Wales were even closer to taking the lead after 10 minutes when Georgallides made a hash of Bale's 30-yard free-kick before redeeming himself by blocking Neil Taylor's follow-up effort. 
 
There were Cypriot howls for a penalty when Nestoras Mitidis tumbled in the box under Ashley Williams' challenge and the Wales captain was in the right place to cut out a near-post cross as the hosts threatened. 
 
Bale had uncharacteristically been guilty of a couple of misplaced passes but he sprang to life after 27 minutes when he toyed with a couple of defenders before crossing from the right. 
 
Edwards met it to head home, but Polish referee Szymon Marciniak had spotted a push on a Cyprus defender with Hal Robson-Kanu, perhaps harshly, judged to be the guilty man. 
   Promoted stories   
The incident, however, sparked Bale into life and a clever interchange with Robson-Kanu presented an opportunity for the Real Madrid forward to bear down on the home goal. 
 
Bale looked as if he had got away until a terrific sliding intervention from Constantinos Laifis stopped him in his tracks. 
 
Wales breathed a sigh of relief five minutes before the break when Constaninos Charalambidis' free-kick picked out Andreas Makris, but his rising drive cleared the bar by some distance. 
 
The visitors needed to establish their authority on the contest but Cyprus almost took advantage when the visitors again coughed up possession straight after the re-start. 
 
Marios Nicolaou took aim from 25 yards and Wayne Hennessey could only shovel the ball out in front of him for the outstanding Williams to clear. 
 
Bale was dropping deeper in a bid to influence proceedings and he slipped through Robson-Kanu who tried to round Georgallides, but the goalkeeper was off his line quickly and got a vital touch on the ball. 
 
Wales were desperately in need of inspiration and it came after Georgallides had batted away Ramsey's close-range efffort after Taylor had made inroads down the left. 
   
 Share article  
   
This time it was the right-sided wing-back Richards who was the provider and Bale lost his marker to power home his 18th goal for his country. 
 
Hennessey saved from substitute Pieros Sotiriou at the death, but Wales had done enough to take another massive step on the road to France.",e7434825-7d5b-4cd2-a4fc-055b5b0a283b,News,2015-09-03T21:13:03Z,Borehamwood Times,Wales move a step closer to Euro 2016 thanks to Gareth Bale's winner in Cyprus,0.0,News

A BUJA —The  monarch  of Ibiaku Issiet in Uruan Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State, Chief Williams Etim, has been kidnapped along with his elder brother, Mr. Placid Etim. The kidnappers have demanded N200 million ransom. 
 
The victims were abducted at about 2:30am yesterday at their country home in Ibioku Essiet, according to a member of the family and former member of the House of Representatives, Bassey Effiong Etim. 
 
Etim, who briefed journalists in Abuja on the development yesterday, said the criminals called him to demand N200 million ransom. 
 
“They called me about  12:00noon today (yesterday) to demand N200 million, and I’m just wondering how I can raise that kind of money,” he lamented. 
 
The ex-lawmaker, who was the Chairman of the House Committee on Economic and Financial Crimes, Drugs and Narcotics from 2007-2011, regretted the incessant kidnapping in the country, especially in its southern part. 
 
Etim confessed that the abductees were his “blood brothers” and pleaded with the government of President Muhammadu Buhari to come to their rescue. 
 
He, however, commended the President for the swift rescue of former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, SGF, Chief Olu Falae. He urged the Inspector General of Police, the Director of Department for State Service, DSS, and other security agencies to move swiftly to rescue the abductees. 
 
“I am using this medium to commend the Federal government and the Inspector General of Police for the efforts in the rescue of the former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Chief Olu Falae. 
 
‘’I’m in  the same vein calling on the Inspector General of Police, the DSS and other security operatives to move and rescue these innocent and law abiding citizens presently suffering untold hardship in the den of kidnappers,” he said. 
 
According to him, several attempts to reach one of the supposed kidnappers who called earlier to demand the ransom, were unsuccessful.

4829,"Says the salary should reflect the level of responsibility and those with outside interests should not be deterred from entering Parliament 

New Delhi: Amid demands that MPs should not be allowed to decide their salaries, the government has proposed to set up a three-member panel to recommend pay and perks of lawmakers. 

The Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs has proposed a 3-member independent Emoluments Commission to recommend salaries and other allowances for the Members of Parliament. The proposal is part of the agenda notes prepared for the two-day All India Whips’ Conference to be held at Visakhapatnam, next week. 

“The setting up of an independent Emoluments Commission for recommending the salaries and allowances of the Members of Parliament will not only put to rest the public outcry and media criticism over MPs themselves deciding their salaries, it will also provide an appropriate opportunity to take into consideration the huge responsibilities and the important role they play in our representative democracy. 

“It would ensure that recommendations on Parliamentary salary are reached in a fair, transparent and equitable way. Once there is consensus on setting up of the Commission, the Salary, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament Act, 1954 will be suitably amended,” it said. 

The general principles suggested by the Ministry for determination of salary are: it should not be so low as to deter suitable candidates or so high as to make pay the primary attraction for the job. It says the salary should reflect the level of responsibility and those with outside interests should not be deterred from entering Parliament. 

One of the principles suggested is that those who choose to make Parliament a full-time career should be adequately rewarded to reflect their responsibilities. 

As per Article 106 of the Constitution, salaries of MPs are determined by an Act of 1954, amended from time to time. The last revision in salary of MPs was made in 2010 during UPA II rule and the lawmakers at present get a basic salary of Rs50,000 (Dh2,774) per month. Salaries of Members of State Legislatures are decided as per Article 195 of the Constitution. 

As per a comparative analysis of Members of Parliament in 37 developing and developed countries, basic salary of MPs are in the range of a meagre Rs7,952 in Tunisia to a high of Rs6,16,675 per month in Israel. MPs of only six countries — Tunisia, Venezuela, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Haiti and Panama are drawing salary less than that of Indian MPs. 

According to a survey conducted by Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) of 138 chambers from 104 Parliaments, 69 chambers indicated that it is Parliament which determines the salaries of members. 31 of these stated that MPs’ salaries are determined in reference to the Civil Service salary scale. In case of Bhutan, Namibia and the UK House of Commons, salaries are determined by independent bodies. 

An MP in India gets a salary of Rs50,000 per month. In addition, Rs2,000 per day is paid as daily allowance when the MP signs the register while attending Parliament sessions or House committee meetings. The MP is entitled to Rs45,000 constituency allowance every month — Rs15,000 for stationery and Rs30,000 to employ secretarial assistance staff. 

MPs are also entitled for a government accommodation, air travel and train travel facilities, besides three landline and two mobile phones. 

They also get a loan of Rs400,000 to buy a vehicle.

The lowdown: Rugby World Cup 2015 The man who helped Jarryd Hayne break into the NFL is scouring the Rugby World Cup for the next cross-sport convert who can crack the United States market. As the Wallabies prepare to begin their World Cup campaign against Fiji in Cardiff, NFL agent Jack Bechta has made his intentions clear as he searches for a Hayne clone.

Hayne has made a remarkable transition from NRL superstar to NFL rookie with the San Francisco 49ers after he quit his Parramatta Eels deal last year.

Now Bechta has his eyes on some new targets who are capable of breaking into the lucrative market.

""I'm actively scouting and trying to identify three to five guys who potentially fit the profile of an NFL player,"" Bechta told ESPN.

""Rugby players are better conditioned athletes than NFL players - from a toughness, training standpoint they won't have any problems making the transfer.""

Wallabies fans can rest easy with prized possession Israel Folau recently committing to a new deal which will see him stay in Australian rugby.

But the Wallabies spent two weeks in the United States with many players showing their love of NFL with some slick moves on the training fields at Notre Dame.

NFL talk has infiltrated the Wallabies camp with playmakers referred to as quarterbacks and assistant coach Stephen Larkham saying wingers were running backs.

""Only one out of every five or 10 will make it. It is a tough journey. It is more challenging than people think,"" Bechta said.

""It is the mental challenge of learning a new game ... In Hayne's case, I hired the best NFL former coaches and surrounded him with former players and gave him a crash course on the basics before we decided to sign him to a team.

Firefly is developing one combustor design that will be utilized to power both stages of their small-sat launcher – ""Firefly Alpha.""  The Alpha upper stage will utilize an engine (FRE-1) with a single combustor, whereas the first stage engine (FRE-2) will use an array of twelve of the same combustors arranged in an annular aerospike configuration. 

FRE-R1 is a propulsion pathfinder for both stages of Alpha.  It operates using LOx/ RP-1 propellants, but the basic combustor design can utilize either methane or RP-1 fuels.  The upper stage variant of the engine (FRE-1) will produce 7,000 lbf thrust, and the first stage cluster used in FRE-2 will produce 125,000 lbf thrust.  

The first test series successfully demonstrated startup, shutdown, and steady state combustion.  The test also served to prove the complete functionality of Firefly's new test site.  Upcoming engine tests will emphasize performance tuning and longer duration ""mission duty cycle"" runs.  The first hot-fire tests of the FRE-2 aerospike engine are expected to take place in early 2016. 

""In only fifteen months, we have built our Texas team, constructed state-of-the-art engineering and test facilities, designed a complete rocket (Alpha) to PDR level, and built and tested key vehicle technologies, such as the FRE-R1 engine,"" added Markusic.    
 
""I'm incredibly proud of the innovative and hard-driving spirit of the Firefly team.  They are smart, hard-working and building momentum in hardware development, which will carry Firefly to space in short order.""

6064,"The 2015 Green Building Economic Impact Study, released today by USGBC and prepared by Booz Allen, finds the green building industry contributes more than $134.3 billion 

By 2018, the study finds, green construction will account for more than 3.3 million U.S. jobs–more than one-third of the entire U.S. construction sector–and generate $190.3 billion 

""Green building is playing a massive role in the U.S. construction sector, the clean and efficient energy sector and the U.S. economy as a whole,"" said Rick Fedrizzi 

The new USGBC analysis also explores the multifaceted economic contribution of green construction to the U.S. economy and individual U.S. states, quantifying the economic impact of green building and LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design). 

""Our research shows that green building has created millions of jobs and contributed hundreds of billions of dollars to the U.S. economy, with the construction of LEED-certified buildings accounting for about 40 percent of green construction's overall contribution to GDP in 2015,"" said David Erne 

In addition to national jobs, GDP and labor earnings from green building, the study projects significant growth in green building's contribution to individual states' tax contributions and environmental asset indicators at both the national and state levels. 

Total state earnings related to LEED building construction projects are estimated to total $8.4 billion

Bengals WR A.J. Green , who caught 10 passes for 227 yards and two touchdowns this past Sunday at Baltimore, today was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week by the NFL. 
 
Green's 227 yards constitute not only the most receiving yards in a game by any NFL player this season, but also the most yards from scrimmage. The 227 was his career high and the second-most receiving yards in Bengals history, behind Chad Johnson's 260 vs. San Diego in 2006. Green now holds the Nos. 2-3 game receiving yards totals in Bengals history. His previous high, 224 yards last season vs. Pittsburgh, stands third. 
 
Green's touchdowns last week were both in the fourth quarter. The first, an 80-yarder on which he ran the last 50 yards and eluded two tacklers, erased a 17-14 Bengals deficit. The second, a seven-yarder, erased another deficit and provided the game-winning points in 28-24 decision. 
 
Though he has been a Pro Bowl selection in each of his four full NFL seasons, Green had not previously won an Offensive Player of the Week award. He did win AFC Offensive Player of the Month award for September 2012. 
 
The last Bengal to win an AFC Player of the Week award was CB Dre Kirkpatrick , for a two-INT performance in Cincinnati's playoff-clinching win vs. Denver in Week 16 of last season. The last Bengal to win an AFC Offensive Player of the Week award was HB Jeremy Hill , who had 169 scrimmage yards and two rushing TDs in Week 15 of last season at Cleveland.

 TWO weeks ago I wrote about compassion, and was lambasted by some readers.  
   
I expected that. 

My subject was refugees, and how we should be taking them in, not turning them away. 

On the day the piece appeared, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott bowed to public pressure, and agreed to accept a few thousand of those people fleeing from Islamic State in Syria. 

However, my Facebook news feed over the last week has been full of hatred and fear, both in Australia and in the UK. 

I’ve found out that some of my friends, especially in the UK, are racist, sharing photos and videos purporting to show that the refugees are actually members of ISIS, put there to infiltrate other countries. 
 
Other pictures show families heading to a place called “Benefits”. 

I’m disappointed in these friends. 

I thought they would show compassion. 

Instead they’re showing fear and hatred. 

Their fear is that Islam is suddenly going to take over the world. 

I find it sad that there’s such intolerance. 
     
 ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE? John Lennon and Yoko Ono staged “love-Ins” during the 1960s, as they strived for a peaceful future. PICTURE: SUPPLIED  Source: News Limited  
    
I was a child of the 1960s, and grew up with the phrase: “Make Love, Not War”. 

I watched as John Lennon and Yoko Ono staged “love-Ins”, and hippies in San Francisco put flowers in their hair, all in the name of world peace. 

I look back on those days fondly. 

Here’s an edited version of the sort of Facebook post I’m talking about. 

“Muslims who want to live under Islamic Sharia law need to get out. 

“We speak English as our common language not any other language. Therefore, if you wish to become part of society, learn the language and speak it. 

“If God or other parts of British culture offend you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your home, because God and Christian values are a major part of our culture.” 

As I wrote a couple of weeks ago, we’re all migrants or refugees here in Cairns. 

I think back to my home town in the UK, which was host to French prisoners of war in the Napoleonic wars, and then in the Second World War, Polish refugees arrived. 

After they proved to be no danger, the French were allowed to wander around town freely, and after the Second World War, many of the Poles stayed, making great contributions to the town’s industries and culture. 
     
 NOT THE PROBLEM: Refugees should not be treated with fear and hatred. PICTURE: DAVID RAMOS/GETTY  Source:   
    
When we arrived in Australia back in 1992, we came here for a better life for our children, and part of the appeal was to live in a truly multicultural society. 

My children have undoubtedly had a better life than they would have had in the UK. 

Finally, I’ve had two GPs since moving to Cairns six years ago. 

The first was from Iran, and my current GP is Irish. 

Both migrants, and on Monday I saw a different doctor, who was obviously Indian or Pakistani, yet another migrant, and I was happy to put my healthcare into his hands. 

I reiterate, if it wasn’t for migrants and refugees, Cairns would be a very different place than it is today. 

A friend works for a Catholic aid agency in town. 

One of their core values is: “Solidarity … everyone belongs to one human family, regardless of their national, religious, ethnic, economic, political and ideological differences.” 

Sounds good to me. 

We only live once, let’s try and live that life in peace, not war.

3990,"Constituency system 

New scheme should not cut proportional representation　 

An independent panel formed by the National Election Commission is scheduled to hold a meeting this week to decide on the number of electoral districts for the forthcoming parliamentary elections. It suggested Saturday the number would be set at between 244 and 249 -- little changed from the current system, under which 246 lawmakers are elected from constituencies. 

The suggestion has prompted a negative response particularly from the ruling Saenuri Party, with its leader Rep. Kim Moo-sung describing it as “unrealistic.” Some lawmakers of the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy have also joined the criticism of the proposed rezoning scheme. 

The panel has worked on redrawing electoral districts to reflect a ruling by the Constitutional Court last year that the population deviation between the most and least populous constituencies should be narrowed from the current 3-1 to 2-1. This adjustment is overdue, given that other advanced democracies have stricter limits on the population deviation among electoral precincts to ensure each voter exercises more equal voting rights. 

Leaving the number of constituencies unchanged as suggested by the panel means some of the current 246 parliamentary districts -- mostly in rural areas -- are to be merged or abolished. 

The ruling party has called for increasing the number of lawmakers elected from constituencies and accordingly cutting the portion of proportional representation seats in the 300-member parliament. In contrast, the NPAD has insisted on electing more lawmakers through the proportional representation system. 

The different positions taken by the parties mirror their calculation on what scheme would help them get more seats in the parliamentary elections set for April. What makes the situation more complicated is that some opposition lawmakers elected from rural districts have vehemently opposed a possible merger or abolition of their constituencies. 

These conflicting interests have barred the parliamentary special committee on political reform from establishing guidelines for redrawing constituencies. 

The NEC panel says it is ready to reflect specific guidelines to be set by the committee in drawing up the final rezoning scheme, which should be submitted to the parliament by the legal deadline of Oct. 13. 

Some commentators argue that reducing the number of proportional representation seats is necessary to remove the confusion. But more caution is needed in taking this approach. True, the system has fallen short of serving its purpose of drafting in fresh and competent figures from various walks of life. But this cannot be a reason to understate its need and the problem can be overcome by improving the selection process.

4439,"(CNN) -  
At least two Federal Air Marshals are at the center of a prostitution investigation by the Transportation Security Administration. 
 
The TSA's Office of Professional Responsibility and Office of Inspections has launched a probe into allegations two air marshals engaged in sexual activity with prostitutes and recorded the acts on government issued cell phones. In early September the House Oversight Committee received a briefing on the matter from Federal Air Marshal Director Roderick Allison. 

A spokeswoman for the House Oversight Committee said the case is out of Chicago and involved three air marshals, but only two have been accused in the prostitution probe. 

According to Henshaw, ""Agent A"" filed a worker's compensation claim saying they were injured on the the job. 

""Agent B,"" in an effort to disprove ""Agent A's"" workers compensation claim showed investigators footage they captured on a government issued cell phone. Video allegedly shows ""Agent A"" was hurt at a sporting event and not at work. In the process of showing the cell phone video to investigators, video of ""Agent B"" and ""Agent C"" engaging in sexual activity with a prostitute is discovered. 

Henshaw cannot confirm where this sexual activity happened and whether the air marshals were on duty when it happened. Members of the oversight committee say they do know the sexual activity involving two federal air marshals and prostitutes was recorded with a government issued phone. 

More questions about this will be asked at Thursday's House Oversight Committee hearing at 2 p.m. on Capitol Hill. The committee will examine personnel actions taken at the Federal Air Marshal Service to address improper behavior, as well as managerial decisions to prevent further misconduct. 

TSA spokesman Bruce Anderson said the agency will not comment on the specifics of this case and only provided a statement to CNN. 

""TSA demands the highest standards of integrity and professionalism from its employees,"" Anderson said in the statement. ""When criminal behavior or misconduct is substantiated, TSA vigorously holds its employees accountable. Even though constrained from commenting on an active investigation, we can confirm that two of the employees involved have been placed on an indefinite suspension without pay, and the third employee has resigned from the agency.""",91cd77e8-9c75-47ba-b46c-3672a7873c81,News,2015-09-17T21:30:54Z,Idaho8.com,Report: Federal Air Marshals solicit prostitutes,0.0,News

448,"These Fashion Staples Encourage One to Wear White After Labour Day  
 
 By:  -  Published: Sep 4, 2015  
 The origins of the ""No white after Labor Day"" rule are shrouded in mystery and confusion. 
It's possible that the rule was conceived simply as a reminder not to wear lightweight, easily stained white clothing outside of the summer season, which was book-ended by Memorial Day and Labor Day. It's also thought that in the late 1800s and early 1900s, the white after Labor Day rule was part of a vast and complex set of fashion and etiquette rules meant to separate older land-owning families from the nouveau riche population in the U.S. 

However, since the 1950s and 60s, when the white after Labor Day custom reached its peak and then began to decline, it's become entirely acceptable to wear white into September and right through the winter. Some fashion icons, notably Coco Chanel, never even conformed to the rigid rule -- so follow these fashion ideas to flaunt white after Labor Day.   Stats for Trending: Fresh & Hot

1665,"(CNN) -  
You may not be lucky enough to meet Pope Francis when he visits New York, Philadelphia and Washington later this month. 
 
But you can still try to make him laugh. 

A new digital campaign, ""Joke with the Pope,"" is encouraging people to submit jokes -- no dirty ones, please -- as part of a contest to fund charitable causes, sanctioned by the Catholic Church, that help the world's less fortunate. 

Between now and October 2, anyone -- not just Catholics -- can post a written joke or upload a brief video of themselves telling a joke to JokeWiththePope.org. Contestants choose one of three causes to support: helping street children in Buenos Aires, Argentina; housing the homeless in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; or feeding the hungry in Nairobi, Kenya. 

A panel of judges, with the possible help of actor-comedian Bill Murray, will choose a winner October 5. The funniest joke may even get shared with the pontiff himself. 

""I like to laugh. It helps me to feel closer to God and closer to other people. When we laugh with each other -- and not at each other -- God's love is present in a special way,"" said Pope Francis in a statement provided by the Pontifical Mission Societies, which created the campaign. 

""I invite you to share your joy with a laugh! God longs for you to be happy!"" the pope said. ""Share your jokes and your funny stories: the world will be better, the Pope will be happy and God will be the happiest of all."" 

A handful of celebrities, including magician David Copperfield and TV weatherman Al Roker, have already submitted videos of themselves telling jokes. Conan O'Brien offered this: ""The California drought is so bad, people in Napa are asking the pope to change the wine into water."" 

The Pontifical Mission Societies will bestow the title of ""honorary comedic adviser to the pope"" on whoever wins the contest and donate $10,000 to the cause chosen by the winner. 

The Catholic Church's official support organization for overseas missions, the Pontifical Mission Societies provide education, health care and other services to the world's neediest people while spreading Christianity around the globe. The mission societies just launched a new mobile app, Missio, to help users explore worthy causes and donate to specific projects. 

The Rev. Andrew Small, national director of the Pontifical Mission Societies in the United States, said the ""Joke with the Pope"" campaign is a way to spread laughter and unite people while helping the world's neediest communities. The campaign is also a tribute of sorts to Pope Francis, who has a well-documented sense of humor. 

""Humor is something that we all share -- every culture, every people,"" Small said. ""If you can tell a joke and laugh at someone else's joke, it shows there's a certain level of comfort with one another."" 

Religious jokes and even pope jokes are welcome, Small said. But contestants must respect limits of decency. In other words, Small said, don't submit a joke you wouldn't tell in front of the pope.",046b37f8-8ef7-4ccd-a1f5-5ca7bd9632e8,News,2015-09-11T13:15:35Z,ABC 17 News,Catholic church promotes 'Joke with the Pope',0.0,News

5573,"Hard to believe we are already staring at week three of the season. It's moving right along and the Raiders, sitting at 1-1, have the opportunity in Cleveland to start the season 2-1 for the first time since 2011. Both teams are 1-1 with both winning last week thanks to an air assault.

No more going streaking

For the past decade plus, the word ""streak"" has not been a positive one in Oakland. It usually is preceded by the word ""Losing"". There are many of those ugly streaks in play right now that would only get uglier with a loss on Sunday. By the same token, all of those long streaks would come to an end with a win. The biggest streak is not having won in the Eastern Time Zone in six years -- that's 16-straight losses. There are several of them which could either be prolonged or stopped Sunday. See them all here.

Browns have the book on Derek Carr

If there's any team in the NFL who knows Derek Carr's, it's the Browns. That's because their offensive coordinator is Raiders former quarterbacks coach, John DeFillippo. No one on the NFL level has spent more time with Carr, so no one is in a better position to exploit his weaknesses. The Browns as a team played against Carr last season as well, which gives the defense some recent experience to draw from.









Josh McCown gets the nod over Johnny Manziel

Once Josh cleared concussion tests, the Browns wasted no time in naming him the team's starter. They did that despite Johnny Manziel's three touchdown performance last week in a win over the Titans. McCown was the starter heading into the season and was knocked out of the team's opener early. It's clear Pettine wants to give McCown every opportunity to show he can be their starter without fear of losing his job because of an injury. But is he a better option than Manziel? Hard to say. Though Manziel would have given the Raiders' defense one more thing to worry about with his mobility.
Run. The. Ball. (For real this time)

We keep saying this and it keeps not happening. But this time it must happen. Latavius Murray is putting up good numbers, but has gotten the ball about half as much as he probably should in this game. The Browns have the worst run defense in the league and one of the better pass defenses in the league. Add that the Raiders defense has given up 33 points in each of their first two games, and you also have the need to try and control the clock and keep the Browns offense off the field.








What does Derek Carr do for an encore?

Derek Carr is coming off his best game as a Raider. It was the first time in his career he threw for over 350 yards, three touchdowns, and put the team on his back to lead them to a come-from-behind victory late. He doesn't need to do it again in this one and he probably shouldn't. The Browns know he CAN do it. They must respect his ability to go down the field. He's got them right where he wants them. He doesn't need to be spectacular Sunday. He just needs to be efficient. Don't try to do too much. This isn't fantasy football and the only numbers that matter are the ones in the W and L column.








Dead last defense

There is no team in the NFL this season which has given up more yards (889) than the Raiders over the first two games this season. They also give up a league worst 6.6 yards per play. That's friggin pathetic. It has resulted in the second most points given up (66) over the firsts two games. Missed tackles are plaguing the Raiders' defenders, especially among the linebackers and safeties. They also don't have a single sack on the season. Derek Carr can't bail them out every game. Especially against a tough pass defense like the Browns have. Time to find ""what you're good at"" as Ken Norton Jr said this week. Like, quickly.
CWood recovery

Charles Woodson dislocated his shoulder late in the Raiders season opening loss to the Bengals. He miraculously play the entire game last week against the Ravens, but it was quite clear he was nowhere near 100%. He missed three tackles in the game, solely because he couldn't wrap up. Now another week has gone by, and he practiced full on Thursday and Friday which suggests he is back healthy and should have full use of both his arms. That's huge for the Raiders who desperately need him to be at his best.









TJ Carrie vs Travis Benjamin


The Browns best receiver these days is Travis Benjamin. The Raiders best cornerback is TJ Carrie. He should receive the task of shutting down the speedy Benjamin, who has four touchdowns this season. And you can bet the OU grad Carrie will have a few folks in the stands hoping to see him do well.

Austin Howard vs Paul Kruger


Last season when these two teams met, Kruger welcomed Derek Carr to his nightmare by sacking him three times. He will be trying once again to put Carr to sleep and most of those times, it will be Howard who will try to prevent the Browns from releasing a horror sequel.

J'Marcus Webb vs John Hughes


Thus far this season, Webb has held up fairly well considering the former tackle was a complete unknown as a guard when the team signed him this offseason. He will often be facing the Browns' best defensive lineman Sunday. Hughes had two sacks and a forced fumble last week on the elusive Marcus Mariota to help the Browns knock off the Titans.

7629,"Extollo Communications LANSocket 1500 review: Top speed and a power-passthrough, too Posted in Secret Video by admin on September 08, 2015. One of the newest HomePlug AV2 MIMO powerline networking products to hit the market is also the fastest we’ve seen. With average throughput of 363 megabits per second in our JPerf tests, the Extollo LANSocket 1500 kit beat our previous speed champ, the D-Link Powerline AV2 2000 (DHP-701AV) by almost 14Mbps. The results weren’t particularly surprising given that both products are based on the same Broadcom chips designed to increase speed by supporting the maximum frequency range (2- to 85MHz) of the HomePlug AV2 MIMO spec. D-Link’s adapters averaged a bit less than 350Mbps—which is still a good deal faster than the rates for adapters based on AV2 MIMO chips that only operate in the 2- to 68MHz range.

6694,"In San Francisco, the richest 5% of households rake in an average of $423,000 a year, while the poorest 20% make around $24,000. The income gap between rich and poor is even worse in Atlanta, where the wealthiest people make nearly 20 times more. As the gap between rich and poor grows in the U.S., it's worst in big cities. In a Brookings Institution ranking of the most unequal cities in the country, Atlanta and San Francisco topped the list, but others were close behind. Cities With Largest Income Gap
1. Atlanta 2. San Francisco 3. Boston 4. Miami 5. Washington, D.C.
6. New York City
7. Dallas
8. Chicago 9. Los Angeles
10. Minneapolis Big cities have more inequality for two reasons, says Alan Berube, deputy director and senior fellow of the metropolitan policy program at Brookings. For one, they contain relatively more subsidized housing and services for the poor. On the other end of the spectrum, most cities are also home to the highest-value jobs in their regions, in sectors like finance, professional services, education, and technology. Cities like San Francisco or Washington, D.C. have high inequality because they have the first and third highest incomes in the nation. In Miami, which has a relatively large number of poor households out of the 50 largest cities, the gap is also big. Atlanta stands out on both counts: The rich are unusually rich, and the poor are unusually poor. Brookings, a D.C.-based think tank, analyzes inequality each year based on the most recent data (this year was based on 2013 data). The gap has been getting bigger, but a few factors may eventually reverse the trend. As some cities start to add new minimum wage laws, the list of most unequal cities may slowly start to change. Los Angeles, for example, will phase in a new $15 minimum wage by 2020. And so far, only a handful of cities, like Seattle and D.C., have passed meaningful changes to the minimum wage. ""I wouldn't expect those increases to significantly affect the next set of inequality rankings,"" says Berube. ""It may take a few years."" Los Angeles comes in at number 9. Beyond minimum wage, cities are experimenting with various other policies to cut inequality. Berube lists a few examples, including job-training programs in Chicago, zoning policies to preserve moderately priced housing in Seattle, and economic development strategies that prioritize 'opportunity industries' for less educated workers in New Orleans."" In San Francisco, the poorest household incomes are already going up, but that might be partially for another reason: With the average 1-bed apartment going for over $3,800 a month in rent, some of the poorest San Franciscans are simply moving away.",7e25dd3f-8d05-4154-ae1b-46fe20315077,Blog,2015-09-15T11:00:00Z,Co.Exist,The 10 U.S. Cities With The Biggest Gap Between Rich And Poor,1.0,Blog

5000,"Fanfic just got a whole lot more respectable, if somehow a bit nerdier. Blake Ross, founder of Firefox, wrote his own spec script for the third-season premiere of Silicon Valley . As Ross writes on his Facebook page : 

I couldn’t wait 8 more months for season 3 of Silicon Valley to start, so I spent the past 48 hours writing my own episode. It picks up where season 2 left off. 

This is my first television script ever, which means it’s probably the roughest draft I’ve ever shared. I plan to do this a thousand more times until I figure out the medium. Until then, I’m taking a page from all those tech companies who wait ’til the Friday night of an Apple launch to quietly announce that they’re replacing their privacy policy with a Snickers wrapper: 

I’m shipping while you’re all at Burning Man. 

It’s a bold move to put himself out there like that, but luckily Ross is more than capable of rising to the challenge. The episode involves Richard interviewing CEO candidates while the rest of the gang investigates going the open source route. The entire script is posted online , and reads very much like a normal episode of the HBO program. Here’s a passage to give a taste of how Ross captures the spirit of the sitcom: 

While it may be Ross’ first script, he does an excellent job of nailing the voices of all the characters while providing keen insight into the tech world that he surely has accumulated throughout the years. Read the entire 31-page script here and then wait another eight months before Silicon Valley returns.

8342,"I was speaking with a client in Australia recently who told me about one of their largest clients. While the relationship with that client was very strong, they felt that maybe they weren’t doing the best job of conveying and communicating the real value that they were providing to that client. We talked about the situation and I asked them what were they doing? What was their communication with that consulting client like? When they told me about what they were doing, or really what they weren’t doing, I clearly saw an opportunity for them to use a three-stage approach to communicating around the project, updating your client so that they know exactly what’s going on, and I want to share that with you here today. What are you doing at the moment to help your client reach the goals that you have both set together? Setting The Stage There are three stages to this client communication update approach. Let me set the stage. Before we even jump to that, the first thing that you want to think about here is coming into your meetings with a document. It can be a simple one-page printout and there’s going to be three sections to that document. The Past The first section in that document is where you’re going to talk to your client and share with them what you have done for them in the past. This is really where you share with them what you’ve accomplished, what steps you’ve taken, what you’ve implemented, what results have been achieved over the past week, the past month, whatever that time interval has been since you last met or spoke with that client about the project. You review and you make bullet points and you share one by one everything that you’ve done that is worthwhile that the client should know about that is important for them to know about – things that are going well, things that aren’t going well, what results have been achieved. You want to ideally communicate everything so they can see the progress that has been made. That’s really important for a client to see because they’ve made an investment in hiring you. To confirm for them in their mind that they made the right investment, it’s important that they are seeing progress consistently. This is a great opportunity for you to do that, to share what you have accomplished in the past. The Present The second part of this three-stage approach is to share with the client what you are doing now, presently. What are you doing at the moment to help your client reach the goals that you have both set together? What steps are you taking? Again, this is very important for a consulting client for a buyer to see because they want to know not only what you have done in the past but also what you are doing right now. What are you implementing? What are you working on? What is the outcome that you expect to achieve from the work that you are doing right now? Again, this is very important for a consulting client for a buyer to see because they want to know not only what you have done in the past but also what you are doing right now. They’ve made an investment with you, so what are they getting from that investment at this exact moment? An investment in the past is great but an investment in the present, knowing that their money is going to work for them right now, knowing that you are actually actively working on helping them at this moment to get greater results, to get an even better outcome, to solve the problem that they’ve having is really important for a client to see. That allows you to communicate the real value that you’re providing at this exact time. The Future The third part – and this is the part that a lot of consultants forget and it’s a really important one especially if you want to have longer term projects with clients and to eventually or at a certain stage enter into an ongoing retainer with your clients – is to talk to your clients about the future. Not only what have you done in the past, not only what are you doing in the present at this moment, but what will you do going forward? What will you do in the future? What opportunities do you see? What potential additional results or outcomes can be achieved? You want to get your client excited about not only what you’re doing right now but about the possibilities and the opportunities that stand in front of them, and how you are already thinking about how they can be better off, about what additional value can be created for them, what additional advantage can be provided to them. This is really important because your client then sees that not only are you providing value to them in the past and not only are you providing value to them in the present but that you also will provide value to them in the future. What this does is it starts to get them mentally conditioned to almost expect that they are going to want to continue working with you because you’ve identified opportunities for them. Those are opportunities that they are likely going to want to get your help to move on. It’s a great way to not only communicate value but it also steps you up really well to work with that client on a longer term basis and to enter into a retainer type of structure where you can provide ongoing value and benefits and results for your client. The Result I spoke back with my client about a week after when we first talked about this and I shared this approach with him. I asked him, “How did it go? How did your meeting turn out?” That client from Australia responded to me that it was an exceptional meeting, that the buyer, that their client, was very happy with the progress and they had now received additional referrals from that client for more business from others, and that their project with them looks to continue for a long time to come. I’m sure that when you take this approach and implement it into your business, that you’ll also see great benefits from it.",933ea215-98c1-41a4-bb41-ac3929e1267a,Blog,2015-09-14T11:30:41Z,Consulting Success,The 3 Stages to Consulting Client Project Updates,1.0,Blog

 He was pretty excited to hop on the pot and try!  But I think it was mostly just to get the ""1 skittle for trying""...
 A happy boy...next to his Skittle jar and sticker chart :)  He's too cute!
 We went upstairs sporting his new dragon/dino undies...and then decided he wanted to try again (for the Skittle, of course)!) :)  He never did go, but it wasn't bc he didn't try.  We were gone most of the day anyway...so I didn't give him much chance...
                                                    The morning started out like this...trying to let mama sleep in and enforce having the kids making their own lunches.  Not sure it worked well....mornings are not our favorite time.
                                                     Then we raced off to the library to meet a friend at story time...he was mostly excited about the train...
                                                       Who's that cutie with the crazy hair actually sitting listening to the story?
                                                                                                        Checking out the library frog :)  Fascinating!
                                                      Awww...he's Mr. Independent now...checking out his own library books. I remember doing this with my grandma Fergie way back when...
 My smiley girl at gymnastics...
 A blurry pic...but still shows our girl working hard on the bars!
 Shelb working hard at violin!
 Kev saved the day and took Lo to Cub Scouts tonight...I think he was rascally...but at least it wasn't while at violin with me!

3164,"Moody's Corporation ( NYSE:MCO ) today reaffirmed its full-year 2015 
      guidance. Full-year 2015 EPS guidance is still in the range of $4.55 to 
      $4.65. 

“We are reaffirming our 2015 earnings per share guidance of $4.55 to 
      $4.65,” said Raymond McDaniel, President and Chief Executive Officer of 
      Moody’s. “We continue to see generally accessible financial market 
      conditions, as well as strong demand for many of our Moody’s Analytics 
      products. However, market volatility and subdued economic growth in some 
      regions continue to moderate fixed income activity.” 
   
Certain components of Moody’s 2015 revenue guidance have been modified 
      to reflect the Company’s current view of business conditions. While 
      global Moody’s Investors Service (“MIS”) revenue for full-year 2015 is 
      still expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range, 
      non-U.S. MIS revenue is now expected to decrease in the low-single-digit 
      percent range. Additionally, while global Moody’s Analytics revenue for 
      full-year 2015 is still expected to increase in the mid-single-digit 
      percent range, professional services revenue is now expected to decrease 
      in the low-double-digit percent range. 

A full summary of Moody’s guidance as of September 30, 2015 is included 
      in the table at the end of this press release. Moody's outlook for 2015 
      is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market 
      factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business 
      investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing 
      and securitization, and the amount of debt issued. There is an important 
      degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions, and, if actual 
      conditions differ, Moody's results for the year may differ materially 
      from the current outlook. 

Moody's is holding its 2015 Investor Day conference today in New York 
      City. 

The event will also be accessible through a live conference call. 
      Individuals within the U.S. and Canada can access the call by dialing

      Act of 1995 

Certain statements contained in this release are forward-looking 
      statements and are based on future expectations, plans and prospects for 
      Moody’s business and operations that involve a number of risks and 
      uncertainties. Moody’s outlook for 2015 and other forward-looking 
      statements in this release are made as of September 30, 2015, and the 
      Company disclaims any duty to supplement, update or revise such 
      statements on a going-forward basis, whether as a result of subsequent 
      developments, changed expectations or otherwise. In connection with the 
      “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act 
      of 1995, the Company is identifying certain factors that could cause 
      actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those indicated by 
      these forward-looking statements. Those factors, risks and uncertainties 
      include, but are not limited to, the current world-wide credit market 
      disruptions and economic slowdown, which is affecting and could continue 
      to affect the volume of debt and other securities issued in domestic 
      and/or global capital markets; other matters that could affect the 
      volume of debt and other securities issued in domestic and/or global 
      capital markets, including credit quality concerns, changes in interest 
      rates and other volatility in the financial markets; the level of merger 
      and acquisition activity in the US and abroad; the uncertain 
      effectiveness and possible collateral consequences of U.S. and foreign 
      government initiatives to respond to the current world-wide credit 
      disruptions and economic slowdown; concerns in the marketplace affecting 
      our credibility or otherwise affecting market perceptions of the 
      integrity or utility of independent agency ratings; the introduction of 
      competing products or technologies by other companies; pricing pressure 
      from competitors and/or customers; the level of success of new product 
      development and global expansion; the impact of regulation as an NRSRO, 
      the potential for new U.S., state and local legislation and regulations, 
      including provisions in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
      Protection Act and anticipated regulations resulting from that Act; the 
      potential for increased competition and regulation in the EU and other 
      foreign jurisdictions; exposure to litigation related to our rating 
      opinions, as well as any other litigation to which the Company may be 
      subject from time to time; provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act legislation 
      modifying the pleading standards, and EU regulations modifying the 
      liability standards, applicable to credit rating agencies in a manner 
      adverse to credit rating agencies; provisions of EU regulations imposing 
      additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of 
      services; the possible loss of key employees; failures or malfunctions 
      of our operations and infrastructure; any vulnerabilities to cyber 
      threats or other cybersecurity concerns; the outcome of any review by 
      controlling tax authorities of the Company’s global tax planning 
      initiatives; the outcome of those legacy tax matters and legal 
      contingencies that relate to the Company, its predecessors and their 
      affiliated companies for which Moody’s has assumed portions of the 
      financial responsibility; the impact of mergers, acquisitions or other 
      business combinations and the ability of the Company to successfully 
      integrate acquired businesses; currency and foreign exchange volatility; 
      the levels of capital investments; a decline in the demand for credit 
      risk management tools by financial institutions; and other risk factors 
      as discussed in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year 
      ended December 31, 2014 and in other filings made by the Company from 
      time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

2015 Outlook 

Moody’s outlook for 2015 is based on assumptions about many 
      macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, 
      corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and 
      acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the 
      amount of debt issued. There is an important degree of uncertainty 
      surrounding these assumptions, and, if actual conditions differ, Moody’s 
      results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook.

2383,"Saudi Arabia is defending itself against criticism after a stampede in Mecca killed at least 717 hajj pilgrims and injured more than 850 others — the worst such incident in a quarter century. 

The BBC reports that Iran's Supreme National Security Council accused Riyadh of ""incompetence"" for the government's handling of security and called on the Saudis to take responsibility for the deaths. Saudi King Salman has ordered a safety review of the annual pilgrimage. 

Pilgrims from Iran make up the bulk of the deaths reported so far. 

""Unfortunately, these incidents happen in a moment,"" Interior Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Mansour al-Turki said at a news conference. 

The stampede occurred Thursday as the faithful carried out a symbolic stoning of the devil by throwing pebbles against three stone walls. Turki said that initial reports indicated that ""two crowds coming from opposing directions converged at an intersection in Mina, on the outskirts of Mecca, when the pushing and shoving started,"" according to Associated Press reports. 

AP reporter Aya Batrawy, speaking on Thursday's All Things Considered , said that ""from the survivors that I spoke to, they say that for them, it's pretty clear that the Saudi authorities didn't manage the crowds properly."" 

NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton reports that ""there's been sharp criticism of the Saudi organizing authorities and a backlash against reported comments on Saudi-owned al-Arabiya TV. The network reportedly quotes the head of the central hajj committee blaming the stampede on the lack of discipline by some African pilgrims."" 

The AP says that hajj drew 2 million people from more than 180 countries this year and adds that it's ""a huge logistical challenge for Saudi Arabia. The kingdom has spent billions of dollars to accommodate the growing number of pilgrims and maintain safety and security at Islam's holy cities of Mecca and Medina for the annual event.""",24bb4379-d23e-446f-9567-5bf712df478c,News,2015-09-25T12:44:00Z,WWNO,Saudi Arabia Faces Criticism Over Hajj Stampede That Killed 700,0.0,News

4956,"Technology is great; that’s a fact. In seconds we can know the answer to any question, visit any place in the world, buy anything we need or make new friends. But in a world where we all are connected online, what has that done to our “real-life” selves? I’m talking to you 20-somethings. We grew up with Xanga, Myspace, Twitter and Facebook. We’ve had “About me”s, status updates and posts to define ourselves and to tell people anything they’d need to know about us. With the Internet, you can see how someone is doing without really seeing how they’re doing. The truth is that our online selves are a better, funnier, prettier, have-my-s***-together-er versions of who we really are.  In 2014, on average, we spent TWO hours on social media alone every single day. That’s up a half  hour from 2013. 

Scroll. 

    Smirk. 

         Like. 

             Repeat. 

All while we ignore the real world around us. We care more about likes, comments and views than we do conversations. Why is it necessary for us to be reminded constantly that these things aren’t important? How many times have you found yourself “creeping” someone on Facebook to find out information instead of just asking them? Face-to-face interactions have become awkward, all while a quick text is nothing to us. All of this leads me to the question: What in the hell is wrong with us? In a room full of real, live, breathing people, we focus all our energy on a tiny computer in our pockets. We say to our friends: put that on Facebook!  We take 35 pictures just to get “the right one.” We play out our lives in 15-second intervals for anyone to see. Privacy is somewhat a thing of the past. If we didn’t share it online, did it really even happen? In most cases, we have turned all-important personal skill building digital. Swipe left or right on someone instead of walk up to them; press the add button instead of inviting them over; send a message instead of talking.  If we continuously are more concerned with what people think we are doing versus what we actually are doing, then what do we have left? – hundreds or thousands of “friends” and no one to really talk to?  As a generation of innovators, we should take a second to ask ourselves: Do I want my son or daughter to live vicariously through a computer? Do I want real memories, or do I want valencia-filtered ones? Do I love myself or just my selfie?",466907f8-d0f3-4d4f-9c77-b0cabbcf8489,News,2015-09-17T13:00:01Z,Amarillo College Ranger,"Social media dilemma: Love me, love my selfie?",0.0,News

Mhango urged reporters to focus on positives about government and element of ‘biases must be overcome.

He also encouraged the media personnel to aim high by continuing with education to the higher levels to equip themselves with the changes in the world and media industry.

3494,"Carlton Djam, who finished with 128 yards on 27 carries, capped off  the two late drives for the Raiders. The first was a 12-play, 67-yard march that ate up 4:15 of clock. 

Djam scored from 2 yards out on the second drive as CLC rumbled 73 yards on 16 plays and used 8:43 of the fourth quarter clock. 

CLC's Trey Blanchard accumulated 111 yards on 18 carries for a 6.2 yards-per-carry average. 

""It has been crucial to have that running game to complement our passing attack,"" said Raiders head coach Greg Medeck. ""We have two really, really good running backs in Blanchard and Djam and to be able to rely on them and our offensive line to control the line of scrimmage and the tempo late in games has been one of our best features this year. Obviously we have some explosive weapons in the passing game, and one of the best quarterbacks, but for us to be able to win in different ways, particularly running the ball, will help us so much in the postseason."" 

Medeck said fog was a key factor of Saturday's second half. He said the ball was hard to see and even calling plays from the sideline to the field made things difficult. That made the running game and winning time of possession all the more important. 

CLC controlled the ball for 46:42, while Fond du Lac had it for just 15:59. 

The Raiders out rushed Fond du lac 231-77 leading to 454 yards of total offense compared to 217. 

Jake Faber finished 20-of-31 passing for 223 yards and CLC's first two scores. He hit Jackson Winter on a 1-yard pass for a 7-0 halftime lead. Faber connected with Kieran Johnson on a 36-yard strike to answer Fond du Lac's only score in the third. Johnson caught seven passes for 79 yards. 

""This was a very good game for us as we only led 7-0 at the half and 7-6 early in the third quarter,"" Medeck said. ""Offensively we were able to finish off the game by running the ball and sustaining long drives. It might have been our best defensive effort of the year, too. 

""I was really happy with our play in the second half and hopefully a win like this will go a long way to helping us get a home playoff game."" 

Tykeise Johnson intercepted a pass and Sean Walker finished with 9 tackles and 2.5 sacks, two forced fumbles and one recovery. CLC's defensive finished with six total sacks and three forced turnovers.

6062,"AUSTIN, Texas , Sept. 9, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Caringo today introduced FileFly™ for Swarm, a new solution to combine the performance of NetApp and Windows file servers with the limitless scale and high-availability of Caringo Swarm software-defined storage— all without changing the way applications and users work.  

FileFly optimizes filers by transparently moving less-frequently accessed files to Swarm, streamlining backup and recovery, and consolidating all of an organization's data. Once on Swarm, files are secure and accessible from an object storage platform that can scale to 100s of petabytes and beyond using any mix of commodity hardware. This results in over a 400 percent reduction in total cost of ownership when compared to scale-up storage solutions.   
   
""One of the biggest management headaches we face is that our employees store all of the data they create on expensive primary storage—they never delete any files,"" said Martin Kuhn , IT Service Manager for the Max Planck Institute. ""With FileFly, we set policies that move data based on user access patterns to more cost-effective storage while still providing instant access to a user's files."" 

""FileFly preserves and optimizes an organization's investment in their primary storage assets while creating a transparent bridge to the benefits of object storage,"" said Scott Sinclair of Enterprise Strategy Group, Inc. ""Caringo is addressing the primary issues to adoption of object storage, while at the same time addressing the storage silo and cost issues inherent with the use of filers. "" 

Additional FileFly features include: 
Robust search capabilities based on source file name, folder path, MIME type, attachment content disposition, date creation and modification, attributes, owner name and/or source host AES-256 bit data encryption of file data in flight and at rest Flexible access over HTTP, the Amazon S3 API, standard storage protocols or through Caringo ISV partner applications 
""The file and object worlds have collided. File is here to stay for the foreseeable future, but software-defined object storage is the new foundation for the ever-growing pool of accumulating data,"" said Jonathan Ring , CEO and founder of Caringo. ""FileFly provides the necessary capabilities to truly bridge the file and object worlds."" 

For more on FileFly, read Jonathan's blog: To File or Not to File—That is the Question.

121,"UK-based discount chain Poundworld posted record annual sales today. 



The company said that it plans to continue its rapid expansion by opening 60 new stores a year from next year. 

The UK’s second-largest single price discount retailer, behind Poundland, said sales jumped 22% to £422.3m in the 12 months to the end of March in a period when it opened 38 stores, with like-for-like sales up 5.6%. 

The group added that operating profits also hit a record, more than doubling by 130% to £14.6m. 

US buyout group TPG took a majority stake in the business for £150m in May, in a deal which saw founder and chief executive Chris Edwards become a multimillionaire. 

Mr Edwards founded the business from a market stall in Wakefield in 1974. 

Poundworld said as a result of new funding from TPG it will accelerate its store expansion programme to in excess of 60 stores a year from 2016 onwards. 

Mr Edwards said: “We have seen a record financial year and one of landmark progress for the company.” 

He added that he expected “the year ahead to be one of development and consolidation.” 

Mr Edwards said the firm would invest in a new 500,000 square foot warehouse next to its Normanton head office in West Yorkshire, and replace its IT ordering systems. 

He said these changes “will provide a strong platform for rapid growth over the next three years.” 

The group added that its multi-price discount chain Bargain Buy, which trades from more than 50 outlets, saw like-for-like sales lift by 8% over the year. 

Larger rival Poundland, which owns around 500 stores, is in the middle of a £55m acquisition of rival 99p Stores. 

The takeover was last month provisionally cleared by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority.",db785e2d-929b-4bb4-b4fa-65fca5813a80,News,2015-09-14T13:39:31Z,Breaking News.ie,Record sales for Poundworld,0.0,News

5373,"Davis County School buses at the Bus Farm in Farmington on Sept. 13, 2013. A $500,000 grant will help five school districts in Utah cut costs to replace older school buses with a fleet of cleaner vehicles. 
 
Matt Gade, Deseret News 
 
Enlarge photo» 
   
SALT LAKE CITY — The school bus fleet in five districts is about to get less polluting due to a $500,000 grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to help shave costs on 15 new buses. 
 
The Utah Department of Environmental Quality announced Tuesday it was awarded the money through the EPA's National Clean Diesel Campaign. 
 
Money will pay for 25 percent of the costs associated with the bus purchases made by the Davis, Granite, Provo, Tooele and Weber school districts. 
 
“Weber School District has tried diligently to keep up with our transportation needs since the downturn of the economy, and it has been a struggle. This grant assistance gives us a much-needed boost to help us get back on track,” said Jeff Stephens, district superintendent. “Not only does it help us to keep up with an aging fleet, but taking these older buses off the road will improve the air for our schoolchildren.” 
 
Agency estimates show that buses that meet the latest EPA standards result in emission reductions of up to 95 percent, in addition to saving 53,690 gallons of diesel fuel. 
 
As part of the grant requirements, buses from model years 1995-2000 will have to be permanently disabled before the new fleet goes into service. 
 
“The districts will need to provide proof that the engine and chassis have been permanently disabled,” said Lisa Burr, grant coordinator for the Division of Air Quality. “This will ensure the project results in emissions reductions.” 
 
The Utah Department of Environmental Quality has been participating in the EPA’s National Clean Diesel Campaign since 2008. Since that time, more than $10 million in state and federal grants have helped 53 small businesses, 34 school districts, two government entities, and one university purchase cleaner and more fuel-efficient equipment. 
 
Districts throughout the state have been trying to keep up on school bus replacements as a way to reduce pollution and protect children's health, but the costs can be prohibitive, particularly for smaller districts. 
 
Rep. Stephen Handy, R-Layton, has tried during the past two legislative sessions to provide state matching funding for school bus replacement — his bill sat aside $20 million for the effort — but the measure has failed. It is likely he will bring it back in 2016.

BJP leader, Yudhvir Sethi and Govind Sarin at a function at Jammu on Monday. 
 
JAMMU, Sept 7: In order to pay homage to the flood victims of 2014 a function was organised at Tawi Bridge near Maharaja Hari Singh statue , here today. 
Sahyog Bharati organised the event and candles were lit in the memory of the flood affected. 
Senior BJP leader Yudhvir Sethi participated in the homage function which was arranged by Chairman, Sahyog Bharati Parneesh Mahajan. A large number of city residents turned up to pay homage to the victims of September 2014 floods. 
Remembering those who had suffered massive loss of life and property in the natural catastrophe, Yudhvir Sethi said that all across the State huge damage to life and property was done by the floods and the Jammu region suffered an unprecedented loss. 
“People suffered an un-reparable loss due to the nature’s fury but generous support of union Government and timely action of army, paramilitary, disaster management personnel, local administration and the people provided much needed succour to the flood affected,” he added. 
He said the Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself flew to assess the situation and the Central Government went all out to provide required support for rescue, relief and rehabilitation of the flood victims. 
He said need of the hour is to reach out to those who were affected and the Government is continuing with the efforts to extend all needed support to the flood victims.

4737,"Jose Mourinho has told his Chelsea players they are far from untouchable as he prepared to unleash Diego Costa on his former club Porto. 

The Blues boss memorably described the nucleus of his first Chelsea side as permanent names on the team-sheet, but believes his underperforming players are short of that status this term. 

""Untouchables in football, only consistency can give you that status,"" said Mourinho, whose champions are 15th in the Premier League after two wins in the opening seven games. 
 
""In this moment we have fantastic players, the players that gave us the title last season. 
 
""But football is about today, it's not about yesterday. In football you have to be consistent in your performance, in your emotion. 
 
""To be a winner you don't need to win all the time, but to be a winner you must have a strong mentality every game, every day. At this moment I don't have untouchables."" 
 
Mourinho had a strong core to his Premier League and Capital One Cup-winning side last term, which included Costa. 
 
The striker is two matches into a three-match domestic suspension, but is available for Tuesday night's Champions League Group G clash at Estadio do Dragao. 
 
Mourinho lauded Costa's performance in the win over Arsenal, when the Brazil-born Spain striker was a nuisance and retrospectively banned for grappling with Laurent Koscielny. 
 
Asked if he would like 11 players to show the same desire of Costa after Chelsea's stuttering start, Mourinho could not resist a dig at the Football Association for the ban. 
 
""I think we would lose every game, because the desire to suspend him is so big that we wouldn't have players to start the game,"" Mourinho said. 
   Promoted stories   
""I'm happy to have only one and let him play until they decide to suspend him again."" 
 
Midfield playmaker Cesc Fabregas, who enjoyed a fruitful partnership with Costa last term, believes it was wrong for the striker to be banned. 
 
""He's frustrated, obviously, and rightly so. It's very unfair what's happened to him,"" Fabregas said. 
 
Chelsea's core players have so far struggled to hit the heights of last term and former Arsenal and Barcelona midfielder Fabregas says more is required - and not just when Mourinho demands it, as the manager did at half-time of Saturday's abject draw at Newcastle. 
 
""We're not babies. It has to come from us,"" Fabregas added. 
 
""We have to perform because we are winners and because we play for Chelsea. 
 
""Not because the manager has to come to us and be upset and then yes, we perform, like what happened on Saturday at Newcastle. 
 
""Maybe things are not going the way we want at the moment, but I'm sure we'll turn it around. 
 
""We won the league last year, there's no reason why we shouldn't do it again this year. We have to start performing from now."" 
 
Mourinho will attempt to put sentiment to one side against Porto, whom he guided to the 2003 UEFA Cup and the 2004 Champions League titles. 
 
It is not his first return - he made an immediate Champions League return in the 2004-05 season with Chelsea - but he is honoured to feature in the Portuguese club's museum. 
 
Mourinho visited the museum prior to undertaking his media duties on the eve of the match, reminding him of his affinity to the club. 
 
""When you are lucky to be part of it, when you are not just a simple visitor, you are somebody that did something that deserve to be part of that museum, it's very emotional,"" the 52-year-old added. 
 
""You realise that you did something important, something time will not delete. 
 
""It's the kind of visit that makes my heart a bit softer and I have now to go to the hotel and make it hard again, because tomorrow I have a big game."" 
 
There are numerous sub-plots in the encounter, not least the one which sees Mourinho face Iker Casillas, the goalkeeper with whom he had a rotten relationship at Real Madrid. 
   
 Share article  
   
Mourinho interrupted the first question on the subject. 
 
""If you're going to ask me about Casillas, I'm going to greet him at the beginning and the end. No more questions about it,"" he said.",5de7a214-1c77-4ae3-a797-a03f3df6860d,News,2015-09-28T18:56:34Z,Northern Echo,Jose Mourinho: No Chelsea player is untouchable,0.0,News
3424,"  Facts ignored – The invention of the village of Susiya editor Wednesday 2 September 2015	By Ari Briggs.. The fact is that the area occupied by the squatters has only served as grazing land. On July 16 (2015) the daily press briefing of the US State Department astonished legal circles in Israel. In response to the second question, preceded only by an inquiry on the Iran agreement from which Israel is still reeling, State Department spokesperson John Kirby with a prepared statement pressured Israel not to enforce demolition orders against an illegal Arab encampment adjacent to the Jewish community of Susiya. The State Department took this stand despite the fact that these demolition orders had been confirmed by Israel’s High Court in May 2015 after decades of appeals. The Israelis were astonished for two reasons. One, the State Department was apparently misinformed about basic facts of the case. Two, the statement appears to be an arrogant attempt to undermine the Israeli legal system, including its universally respected High Court. The High Court found that these assertions were demonstrably false, based on comprehensive objective historical and geographical accounts. Historical aerial photography, detailed mandatory maps, travelogues from the 18th and 19th centuries, and the population registry all established that their assertions were a fabrication. Fact: no such village ever existed. The High Court has ruled repeatedly against these false assertions (HC 7530/01, 430/12, 1556/12, 1420/14). See the latest opinion pieces on our Opinion & Blogs Facebook page However, the Nawajah family’s “struggle” has become a cause célèbre of the cadre of foreigners and foreign-funded NGOs intent on harming Israel and its standing worldwide through untruths, misrepresentations and outright lies. Second, apparently the State Department failed to realize that the High Court established that the Nawajah family members have permanent homes in Yata, a city in Area A, under full Palestinian Authority rule (HCJ 430/12 and HCJ 1556/12). Moreover, Regavim’s research has established that like other PA residents from Areas A & B, the Nawajah family are being encouraged by the PA in accordance with the Fayyad Plan (2009) and assisted by the EU (EU report “Area C and Palestinian State Building”– 2011) to illegally establish facts on the ground in Area C (under full Israeli authority, as per Oslo Accords). Regavim has documented at least 20 illegal structures in the encampment, funded directly by the EU and proudly bearing the EU flag. The encampment is strategically placed between the Jewish community of Susiya and the Susiya archaeological site. Their agenda is clearly intended to obliterate the fact that an ancient Jewish community, including a magnificent ancient synagogue, thrived in this area before Islam even existed. The fact is that the area occupied by the squatters has only served as grazing land. In 1982 Plia Albeck, the state’s land expert, documented some private land in the area and confirmed it as agricultural land only. Anthropologist Yaacov Havakook researched the area the 1980s when he lived there for several years. As an expert witness he stated: “The Arabs never lived permanently in these caves… the caves have been used only as temporary dwellings by shepherds for two weeks to a month a year during the grazing season.” Two days prior to the State Department statement, B’tselem, an NGO well-funded by the EU and foreign governments including France, the UK and Germany as well as by the New Israel Fund, published a press release saying that pressure from Regavim is forcing the government’s hand and quoting the illegal encampment’s counsel, saying “that this kind of thinly veiled threat to demolish homes in Susiya before the planned court hearing is an unacceptable form of coercion”. Reading this quote one would conclude that the hearing on August 3rd is intended to adjudicate the legality of the demolition orders. This is a deliberate attempt to mislead, and unfortunately, the US State Department was again apparently misled. In fact, the legality of the demolition orders has been confirmed by the High Court many times over the protracted litigation, and the High Court denied a request for an injunction against the orders despite the pending hearing: “Taking the law into one’s own hands even after filing this petition precludes granting an interim order.” (HCJ 1420/14) The State department also stated, “We urge Israeli authorities to work with the residents of the village to finalize a plan for the village that addresses the residents’ humanitarian needs.” The State department purposefully ignored the true state of affairs or was woefully ill informed in this regard as well. In fact, even though they have homes in Yatta, the Civil Administration had agreed to establish a new village in Area C, a mere 2 miles from their current illegal encampment, more than providing for their “humanitarian needs”. It is crucial that the facts be told and the law upheld despite the extreme pressure being applied by the EU and US State Department.The Israeli government dare not cede the rule of law in this blatant and misguided attempt to usurp the authority and power of our courts and legal system.  If the government appears powerless in the face of pressure from such outside forces and continues to sacrifice the country’s interests, Israel will, indeed, invite additional pressure, while weakening its own resolve to pursue justice. Our legal system is internationally recognized as robust, strong and just. Ignoring the history and facts of this particular case would be particularly egregious, as it would blatantly violate a basic legal principle: Ex injuria jus non oritur, legal rights cannot derive from an illegal act, or in this case, decades of demonstrably illegal acts. Regavim is proud to be considered the counter pressure pushing the government to uphold the rule of law and the equal application of that law. The author is a director of Regavim, a research based legal advocacy organization, dedicated to ensuring responsible, legal and accountable use of Israel’s national land.

3388,"After celebrating my birthday in the Philippines by throwing a party for almost 20 years, I knew that it was time to retire from and start spending the day exploring a country, old or new. For my 21st, I decided to go to Hong Kong with Vern and Ben and I was so happy that she surprised me by inviting my best friend along! :) It was a definitely a different experience and I wouldn’t mind doing it again and again :) Hopefully I’ll always have the time and means to! :) 
 
ROOMORAMA made it all the more special by making our nth trip to Hong Kong a different one by making us #LiveLikeALocal. For those of you who are not familiar with the brand, with over 300,000 properties, Roomorama is the largest platform for professionally-managed vacation rentals worldwide. Not only that, they also make sure that each apartment is screened and well curated for quality :) Using the website was even easy as 1.. 2.. 3! All you have to do is type in your destination, your check in and out dates, your budget and viola! You get a choices to pick from :) You can even be more detailed by putting in the neighbourhood you want to be situated in or the tourist spots you want to be near to :) 
 
 Vern knows she’s in Hong Kong if this is available everywhere! :P 
 
 
Our first ROOMORAMA apartment was at Causeway Bay, a mere 2 minute walking distance from the famous Times Square Hong Kong. To tell you honestly, the building didn’t look promising at all.. it was the usual dirty ones from the outside but wow when we arrived? This beauty welcomed us! :) 
 
 
The room had a very interesting personality! :) It had a total of 3 rooms and it was so spacious! It’s very different because Hong Kong is known to have one of the most expensive real estates in the world for little sqm and this was such a treat! :) Goodbye small expensive hotel rooms! 
 
 
This is Times Square Hong Kong. It’s a shopping district in the middle of the business side of the city :) 
 
 
Our first meal was at Agnes B. Cafe! Look at that cute bear dessert! :)   
 
Ofcourse, we visited Hong Kong’s Victoria Harbour! :) 
 
 
Ezra and Vern surprised me by making reservations at the highest bar in the world, Ozone,  that’s located in Ritz Carlton to welcome my birthday. They prepared champagne and a cake for me to blow! :) It felt so surreal! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
#singegirlproblems 
 
 
The next day, Vern and I had my birthday afternoon tea at Ritz Carlton once again :) 
 
 
 
 
We transfered to our next ROOMORAMA apartment to move closer to the city centre and when I requested closer, they moved us right smack in the centre of the city! It was so convenient and I love that this place was more family oriented as Ben and Ezra flew out and my mom flew in :) I could see my family renting this out once again in the near future! It was had FOUR rooms, a balcony, a complete kitchen, a formal dining and living room! :) Perfect! Plus, its just a 5 minute train ride from Mong Kok and Canton Road :)

7822,"HIS CRIME - POKING FUN AT JUDGES' DINNER HOST A British tourist was today charged 30,000 Thai baht (£540) by a court in Thailand for the return of his passport on a charges of a defaming someone by sharing a story from this site on Facebook!
picture: Ally Cooper 'gobsmacked' Alastair Cooper, 40, an oil worker from Hull, was also told that he would have to pay another 100,000 Thai baht (£1800) each time he applied to leave the country, while the case proceeded. Permission would not be granted automatically. He had already paid bail of 100,000.
The person who brought the case in Pattaya court on Thailand’s eastern seaboard is American Drew Walter Noyes, 60, former publisher of the Pattaya Times newspaper, who last year was found guilty of extortion together with his common-law wife Wanrapa Boonsu.
Pic: Arrest report of Drew Noyes and Wanrapa Boonsu for Extortion Both Noyes and Boonsu were sentenced to two years jail but both have been given bail to appeal.
Drew Noyes, who falsely claimed to by an American lawyer, has been repeatedly been given bail to return to the United States, and even had a military escort to the airport.
Pic: Drew Noyes with his mlitary escort at Suvarnabhumi airport Cooper said he had never ever received a summons to attend the trial. He first attended the court last month after hearing the trial had begun in his absence and the prosecution case concluded. He said he was 'gobsmacked'
He had flown from Burma where he is currently working after he heard the news.
“When I turned up I found out that not only had a summons had been sent to an address in Bangkok I had never heard certainly never been to, but the court had accepted this.
""Further they allowed the case to go ahead without me being able to defend myself.  There has got to be something wrong.

Despite paying a fee the Pattaya court has still not given me or my lawyer the case notes of the previous hearing.
""I went to the British Embassy for help. They said there was nothing they could do. The person who interviewed me said he was Indonesian/""
Drew Noyes had told the court that he is returning to Thailand on October 14th. He boasted frequently in his Pattaya Times newspaper about his legal skills and his friendships with the Pattaya court judges. Drew and Wanrapa - dining with the judges He even published a story that he was publishing a book on libel with the Chief Judge of Chonburi and a section of the book would be devoted to the libels of Andrew Drummond – the author of this site.
He frequently had himself photographed with judges including dining with them and celebrating Thailand’s Prince Rapee (National Law Day) at Pattaya Court.
Noyes peering from the second row with court staff and judges on Wan Rapee Day Noyes objected to a photo shopped picture lampooning himself and his colleague Brian Goudie, 48, from Falkirk, taking part in a gay parade. Goudie also falsely claimed to be a lawyer (and also former officer in the Royal Marines).
He is currently on bail on a charge of defrauding a 78-year-old woman out of 7.8 million baht and a warrant has been issued for his arrest for failing to appear in court on another fraud case.
Noyes has claimed: “I am never going to jail.”
Andrew Drummond, a co-defendant in the case, has not attended and a warrant has automatically been issued. ""It can wait.""
Link: The offending story which Cooper is accused of sharing on Facebook.
The story was an account of how Noyes was suing a member of the subzerosiam forum foir publishing the picture. He has not complained about any of the text in the report.  Contested cases in Thailand can last for years, Cooper who Noyes knew was a supporter of this site was enjoined in the case one of many SLAPP cases being brought to waste time and money.",47513723-a081-46c8-8ffc-6e92297c9637,Blog,2015-09-14T20:10:49Z,Andrew Drummond,THAI COURT CHARGES A MONKEY FOR RETURN OF BRIT TOURIST'S PASSPORT,1.0,Blog

Long road to recovery: Will Nightingale looks likely to be out of action for up to eight months 

AFC Wimbledon defender Will Nightingale will be out of action for up to seven months after a scan revealed his knee injury was worse than first believed. 

Boss Neal Ardley was hoping the 20-year-old academy product would be out for no more than two months. 

However, Ardley admitted today that the results of the scan have probably ended Nightingale’s season. 

He told the club’s website: “Will went in for surgery on Thursday evening and when the surgeon took a look at him the knee injury seemed to be a lot worse than the MRI scan had originally shown.

3530,"Hundreds of British troops will be deployed to Somalia and South Sudan to train African peacekeeping forces in order to foster “less terrorism and less migration”, David Cameron has said. The prime minister said he was offering forces to United Nations (UN) and African Union (AU) missions to help tackle conflicts that are facilitating the rise of terrorist groups in Somalia and prompting mass migration from South Sudan, where 2 million people have been displaced by the battle between the government and rebels. About 70 members of the military personnel will be offered to help in Somalia, where a peacekeeping unit is present to tackle the threat of the Islamist group al-Shabaab. They will not be involved in combat operations but will help train AU forces in areas including logistics, engineering and medical aid. Further troops – about 250 to 300 over the course of several missions – are being sent to carry out specific tasks in South Sudan, such as engineering advice and combat training. Cameron will offer the troops at a session on UN peacekeeping on Monday, hosted by the secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, and the US president, Barack Obama, with dozens of other member states expected to make contributions. Speaking before his arrival in New York, Cameron said: “We think Britain has a particular role in training and logistics and expertise and standards, so we want to step up what we are doing. But let me stress, we all want to see all the right force-protection arrangements in place but we should be playing a part in this. “What happens in Somalia, if it’s a good outcome, it’s good for Britain, it means less terrorism, less migration, less piracy; ditto South Sudan.” He said it was “absolutely vital that the international community works together to shore up stability in Africa”. The UK has contributed to many peacekeeping forces over the years, wearing the distinctive blue berets of the UN, but its role is largely limited now to providing about 280 troops participating in the current mission in Cyprus. About £260m has been given in aid to South Sudan since the start of the civil war in December 2013. But the British government has in recent years come under pressure to contribute more in the way of boots on the ground to bolster the UN’s peacekeeping aims.",5552fa4e-d381-444b-8fda-fe81f7aeba6a,Blog,2015-09-27T21:30:13Z,World news | The Guardian,UK to deploy troops to help keep peace in Somalia and South Sudan,1.0,Blog

Online estate agency easyProperty, which is backed by easyJet billionaire Stelios Haji-Ioannou, has staged a mock funeral procession through the streets of central London this morning to mark what it refers to as “the death of the traditional high street estate agent”. 

The three-mile New Orleans-style funeral procession, led by easyProperty chief executive Rob Ellice, went through Westminster, the borough with the largest number of estate agents offices, starting in Marylebone and heading down to Piccadilly Circus. A horse-drawn hearse was followed through the streets by a traditional jazz band and 40 “1980s estate agents” dressed in pin-stripe suits. 

Though new to the growing online agency sector, easyProperty is confident that its presence in the market will contribute to the demise of what it calls “age-old dodgy estate agents who charge ludicrous commissions” in ten years. The company, which started out as a lettings agency, has recently expanded into residential sales, offering a cut-price alternative to traditional agencies, with three alternative fixed flat-fee sales services.",a049d1bf-cb9e-4605-94c1-0eb462e649e7,News,2015-09-29T09:04:17Z,What House?,West End 'funeral procession' to mark “the death of the traditional high street estate agent”,0.0,News
5449,"Yemen's exiled prime minister returned to the country's southern port city of Aden on Wednesday, as anti-Houthi forces are pushing toward the capital Sanaa, government officials told Xinhua.

Prime Minister Khaled Bahah returned along with seven members of his cabinet and a team of top security officials. He will hold a meeting in the next two days in Aden, the government source said on condition of anonymity, adding that reconstruction and humanitarian relief top the agenda.

Bahah, who is also the vice president, announced that his cabinet will resume work in the temporary capital Aden, pledging to continue restoring stability to the city and neighboring provinces that were taken from the Shiite Houthi group.

It's Bahah's second visit to Aden since President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and the cabinet fled to Saudi Arabia to take refuge in March.

On Wednesday, after four days of fierce battles against Shiite Houthi gunmen and their allied forces, Gulf-backed government forces are advancing in the oil-rich province of Marib. Dozens from both sides have been killed in action.

Military officials said heavy airstrikes on Houthis in Marib help pro-Hadi forces to enter Serwah district which was captured by Houthis months ago.

On Sunday, thousands of Yemeni soldiers trained in Saudi Arabia, together with troops from the coalition and hundreds of tribesmen, participated in large military operations against Houthis in Marib, Yemen's most important oil-producing province, some 170 km northeast of the capital Sanaa.

Earlier in the day, Saudi-led airstrikes pounded the general command of the Armed Forces in Yemen's capital Sanaa and several military bases controlled by Houthis. Huge explosions were heard across the city, according to local residents.

The Saudi-led airstrikes also destroyed all main roads and bridges leading to Sanaa in an attempt to cut off supplies and besiege pro-Houthi forces.

Yemen, an impoverished Arab country, has been engulfed in a civil war between the Shiite Houthi group, which is supported by army units loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, and Saudi-backed government forces.

In late March, the Saudi-led coalition began airstrikes against the Houthis in Yemen at the request of President Hadi. The campaign aims to prevent the Houthis from seizing power in Yemen.

1453,"A man who was brutally attacked in Dublin’s Temple Bar area on Thursday night has died. 

The victim, understood to be from Dublin, had been seriously assaulted after being set upon at the Cow’s Lane area in Temple Bar at around 8.45pm on Thursday. 
 
Yesterday morning, as the man lay in a critical condition in St James’s Hospital, gardaí investigating the incident appealed to passers-by in the busy Dublin tourist district who videoed the assault on their smartphones to come forward with the evidence. 
 
Last night the man, in his mid-twenties, passed away in hospital. 
 
An autopsy will now be conducted, most likely today. 
 
However, gardaí said last night that they are still treating the case as one of serious assault, although they are awaiting the results of the autopsy. 
 
Three men in their mid-twenties were arrested at the scene at the attack on Thursday night, while a fourth man, aged in his thirties, was detained later in connection with the incident. 
 
They were still being questioned last night at Pearse Street, Irishtown, and Kevin Street Garda Stations under section four of the Criminal Justice Act. Investigating gardaí said they believe some people in Temple Bar had recorded the assault on their phones. 
 
As of last night, it was unclear if anyone with footage of the attack had come forward with the images and gardaí renewed their appeal to any persons who may have witnessed the incident or were in the vicinity of Cows Lane between 8.30pm and 9 pm, or who took images of the incident, to contact them at Pearse Street Garda Station.

3701,"LAS VEGAS (KSNV News3LV) – Ride-sharing companies Uber and Lyft are up and running in Nevada. Drivers took to the road for the first time Tuesday, even without the county's blessing. 

Both companies received state approval Monday, but Clark County commissioners said Tuesday they would not be allowed to operate without county granted business licenses. 

But hours after the meeting, Lyft and Uber were online.

Uber said it has more than 1,000 contracted drivers ready to go. They've been screened with vehicles inspected and many more are going through the process. 

News 3 opened up the Uber app to find out how much it'll cost going from our station near downtown Las Vegas to The District in Henderson. It was a journey of more than 18 miles. The 25-minute trip cost $45.66, which included a $1 safety fee.

Uber drivers said the prices can vary depending on factors like traffic, but on the slightly faster trip back at 22 minutes, the total cost was $45.19, just a few cents cheaper.

Uber said drivers get 75 percent of the cut, and a big draw for those like Edgar Barbosa is that you are in charge of your work hours.

""With Uber, I don't miss any more birthdays. I make every anniversary now,"" said Barbosa. 

Lyft is also online. One driver told News 3 he uses both Uber and Lyft for passengers. He said he first started using Uber on Tuesday afternoon. He said in four hours he did 12 rides. Then, he switched over to Lyft. 

We took a ride from the station to the Stratosphere, which is a little over 3 miles. Including the trust and safety fee, it cost $13.80. So how about a taxi cab? We went the same distance and it cost $19.34, but when you add a $3 credit card fee and a 15 percent tip, the grand total was $26.01. That's a $12.21 difference.",03ac7a44-afee-4d6b-8bdf-874eb07354ae,News,2015-09-16T06:38:35Z,My News 3,"News 3 takes test rides as Uber, Lyft begin service",0.0,News

6102,"When someone you care about is experiencing a crisis -- whether it's a death, a tragic accident, someone's loved one going into rehab, a divorce, a serious illness: 

SHOW UP. 

SAY something. 

LISTEN. 

It's not enough to say ""sorry"" and expect the Other to move on because you're tired of the emotional distress.  Think how tired the Other must feel living with it all the time.  Glennon Doyle Melton, who pens the blog Momastery , says ""run towards it, sit in it and soak up some of the pain.""  Even a tiny amount absorbed helps, it really does. Dropping out of the Other's life doesn't.  Be a friend who actively cares for the long haul.  Please. 

You don't have to FIX anything. A tragedy is a tragedy precisely because it can't be fixed.  Empathize.  Hold a hand. Bring crazy movies. Bring chocolate.  Bring Diet Coke.  Bring wine.  Lend some of your strength.  Lend a shoulder. 

Help them be strong. 

Help them be. 

Help them. 

Here's the good news:  no one expects you to do it all!  Just pitch in.  Give what you can.  Use the gifts you have. 

But it's not easy.  And it is messy.  There's no getting around that.  Just imagine, though, if there was no one there to help you in the midst of the biggest mess in your life. 

I once read somewhere that children don't always need a ""teachable moment"" for every thing that goes wrong.  Sometimes what they really, simply, need is for someone to commiserate.  ""You're right: that sucks."" 

You feel what you feel -- no one can justifiably tell you HOW you ""should"" feel about anything.  But sometimes in the deep dark times, you need more.  ""I don't want someone to FIX anything -- just validate my feeling as I do!  Let me know I'm not crazy for feeling this way!"" 

Don't we all need to hear ""I'm so sorry -- that really sucks"" at times?  And doesn't it make you feel better to know someone is right there with you, even if there's nothing to be done? You're not alone feeling that way.  Who knew ""that sucks"" could be so powerful? 

But it is.  It really, truly is. 

I hope and pray no one I care about has a tragedy befall them. (That's not terribly realistic, but I still hope.)  I'm asking you to just remember you may very well find yourself in the Other's shoes someday.  And you'd want the people you care about to come to your side.  It's devastating when they don't, making the tragedy even worse. 

The Other in the midst of tragedy doesn't have a choice.  You do.  And the Other needs you to make the choice to BE there with them.  Please. 

Don't wait to be asked: when a Big Bad Awful does strike, the Other can't find their way out of the fog; time is an enemy at that point; and grief is paralyzing.  When getting out of bed is an achievement, expecting the Other to be able to make plans is inexcusable.  I was always the one who made plans and organized for everyone else.  When I did reach out, and was told to basically help myself, I recoiled in shock - and fear.  Some people I thought I could rely on, to whom I automatically turned, suddenly didn't have time for me.  Couldn't be bothered.  Didn't know what to say.  Didn't want to ""choose sides"".  Didn't want to get caught up in the drama. 

But I was beaten over the head with the drama, dropped in the middle of it, and left there.  Alone.  It's scary.  And sickening.  Debilitating. 

Thankfully, gratefully, I did have a greater safety net of loving - and greatly loved - people who were (and still are) my heroes. They and others, stepped up, and into, the midst of this Big Bad Awful.  They didn't fix anything.  They didn't solve anything.  They did something greater: they were HERE. 

Although I've moved on from the Big Bad Awful and am delightfully happy in this life I've made, looking back on it, I really did need people to just say ""I'm thinking of you"" (""I don't know what to say, except I care about you"" is all that needs saying if you're lost for words).  Or ""we're taking you to dinner,"" and it didn't even matter if it was 1/2 an hour at McDonalds.  I certainly needed to hear ""That sucks.""  And I needed it throughout the horrifyingly long ordeal -- not just for the first couple of weeks.  I needed someone else to lead.  I needed people to *keep* showing up (yep, I was needy -- we all are in times of crisis).  And sometimes just hearing ""that sucks"" was really and truly enough for me. 

Send a funny card; send an email; send a text; call.  You can even say ""I've got a minute between meetings, but wanted to let you know I'm thinking of you."" Yes, there will be times you won't be able to do much else other than shoot off a quick text.  But you can give an hour once in a while to meet for a coffee, or go for a walk.  It doesn't always need to be a huge chunk of time you give up to help.  Encourage other friends to do the same.  Like raindrops in a bucket, or pennies in the bank, it all adds up. 

What it comes down to is this:  if we don't have time to be there for the Other people in our lives, then we're not fully living.  And if you're not fully living, then part of you is dead.  And THAT sucks.",6e05bb55-669b-42d1-92c2-ea3f9335f35e,News,2015-09-08T21:31:35Z,Huffington Post,How to Be a Good Friend During a Crisis,0.0,Blog

Research from the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin has found the chances of women getting pregnant over the age of 40 drop rapidly. 

A review of the Human Assisted Reproduction Clinic at the hospital shows women in the 43-45 age bracket have less than half the chance of getting pregnant than those aged 40-42. 

The research, which covers a 16 year period, also found that those in their mid-40s who do get pregnant have a substantially higher risk of losing their baby than those in the younger group. 

It comes as the proportion of women over 40 using the clinic's services has risen from 7% in 1997 to 20% in recent years. 

Consultant at the Rotunda and report author is Dr Edgar Mocanu. 

He says people need to be aware that fertility is a finite entity and should be prioritised to avoid difficulties. 

""Any educational opportunities that are there should stress out that IVF in itself cannot fix a problem, and fertility should be high on everybody's agenda early in their career"" he told Newstalk Breakfast. 

""Mainly because it's a finite entity: one can have the power to earn or buy a house at any age, but in terms of fertility there's only a block of time when a woman can conceive"" he added.",fc09cad0-1661-4a35-bf9a-ff87fa3d86d7,News,2015-09-17T09:40:44Z,Newstalk,Rotunda research shows chances of pregnancy drops rapidly after 40,0.0,Blog

1803,"Ella Collins, winner of Miss Fa’afafine Australia 2015, Sydney PHOTO: THE first-ever Australian contestant to compete in a unique global third gender beauty pageant has claimed second place at the contest. 
 
Ella Collins, from Merrylands in western Sydney, nabbed the runner-up position earlier this month at the annual Miss Fa’afafine international competition, held in the Samoan capital Apia. 
 
Fa’afafine, which in Samoan means “in the manner of women”, are biologically male but commonly express female identities and are generally considered to be a distinct non-binary gender. 
 
In a Facebook post after the event, which attracts contestants from across the Pacific, Collins said it was the “best experience” she had ever had: 
 
Collins, who has a background in dance, won a place at the finals after taking out the crown last month at the inaugural Miss Fa’afafine Australia contest held in south western Sydney. 
 
The pageant included traditional rounds such as swimwear and eveningwear but also featured elements like a round focused on traditional Samoan dancing. The competition is also known for the flamboyance and creativity of its costumes. 
 
Collins took many of the routines she premiered in Sydney, including a high energy and tongue-in-cheek performance mixing Beyoncé and a traditional war dance, to Samoa. 
 
In Sydney, Collins wowed the judges when she said that she hoped her success would be a positive example to young trans* people. 
 
“I’m just all about saving lives and knowing there is a high suicide rate among transgenders I want to be an advocate to stop that and bring awareness to help those kids,” she told the Star Observer at the time. 
 
The overall crown was taken out by New Zealand’s entry, Steve Auina, who had previously won the Miss Auckland Fa’afafine completion.

2631,"By WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Senate's military committee criticized the Obama administration on Thursday for failing to challenge China's building of artificial islands in the South China Sea by sailing within 12 nautical miles (22.2 km) of them, saying this amounted to de facto recognition of Chinese claims.

Assistant Secretary of Defense David Shear responded to Senator John McCain, the chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, by saying that such patrols had not been conducted since 2012, but were among future U.S. options.

The exchange at a hearing of the committee came ahead of a visit to Washington next week by Chinese President Xi Jinping, when U.S. concerns about China's pursuit of territorial claims in the South China Sea will be high on the agenda.

McCain said it was time the United States conducted patrols within 12 nautical miles of China's artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago. 

""The administration has continued to restrict our Navy ships from operating within 12 nautical miles of China's reclaimed islands,"" he said. ""This is a dangerous mistake that grants de facto recognition of China's man-made sovereignty claims.""

McCain said the restrictions had continued, even after China sent naval vessels within 12 nautical miles of the Aleutian Islands off Alaska last week. 

McCain said sailing within 12 miles of the artificial islands would be ""the most visible assertion of freedom of the seas.""

Shear responded by saying: ""We have in recent years conducted freedom-of-navigation operations in the vicinity of those features, and doing so again is one of the options, one of the array of options we're considering."" 

U.S. Pacific commander Admiral Harry Harris said China's building of airfields on the artificial islands and their further militarization was of ""great concern militarily"" and posed a threat to all other countries in the region. 

""China is building three runways of 10,000-foot (3,048- meter) length, which is only a thousand feet shorter than would be required for landing a space shuttle,"" he said.

""And they're also building deep-water port facilities there, which could put their deep-water ships, their combatant ships, there, which gives them an extra capability.

""And if you look at all of these facilities then you can imagine a network of missile sites, of runways, their fifth-generation fighters and surveillance sites and all of that, it creates a mechanism by which China would have de facto control over the South China Sea in any scenario short of war.""

- First quarter sales of $377.8 million

- Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.23

- Total diluted earnings per share of $0.65, inclusive of additional gain from the sale of Telair Cargo Group

WOOD DALE, Ill. 

During the quarter, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $27.7 million 

""Performance in the first quarter was in line with our expectations as we continue executing on our industry-leading aviation and government services strategy,"" said David P. Storch 

Storch continued, ""For the balance of the year, in our Aviation Services segment, we expect continued demand for our MRO services and a return to more robust growth in supply chain. In our Expeditionary Services segment, we expect similar results in the second quarter with sequential improvement through the second half of the year as airlift increases its contracted fleet in different geographies.""

Gross profit margin from continuing operations was 14.4% for the first quarter compared to 15.8% last year. In the Aviation Services segment, gross profit margin improved year-over-year due to higher margins in MRO. In the Expeditionary Services segment, gross profit margin declined year-over-year due to the mix of flying positions at airlift.

First quarter sales to commercial customers represented 61% of consolidated sales, compared to 60% of consolidated sales in the first quarter of last year. The balance of the sales was to government customers including defense. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 10.4% for the first quarter, compared to 9.7% last year. This quarter was adversely impacted by increased legal expenses. Net interest expense from continuing operations for the quarter decreased to $1.9 million

As everything’s just a rumor other than some leaked backdrops which may or may not be true, there’s not much to say other than that there probably is indeed one coming and it will do some new things. You can read all about what it’s rumored to be able to do at the source link below. 
 
With XFinity and Amazon working on streaming gaming and dropping other-device requirements to stream (Amazon has it’s own remote,) hopefully Chromecast2 will have some ability to interface with controllers other than an Android, iPhone, or computer. 
 
If Google’s history repeats itself again, we can expect to see this device released shortly after the announcement, followed by being rooted, that root exploit being patched, another root method coming along, then about a year before the features that the Chromecast2 will tout before it comes to everyone, and then it’ll explode. 
 
Or maybe they learned last time. 
 
Whatever the case, it’s all rumors, so this weekend post some rumors of your own for the Chromecast 2, I’ll start: new embedded microphone listens for when you’re trying to figure out what you want for dinner, and based on your Netflix or Google Play Video queue local Pizza or Indian places will “accidentally” call you asking if you want delivery.

As stated at the time of the 2015 Interim results on 20 August 2015, Phoenix believes there are a number of potential acquisition and consolidation opportunities in the UK closed life sector and has been reviewing those options within the framework of its existing commitment to stakeholders. 

Having secured an investment grade rating earlier this year, the Group is well positioned to take advantage of the consolidation opportunities in its sector.

2912,"The 16th annual Cars Online report : ‘The selfie experience: The evolving behavior of the connected customer’, based on data across seven key markets , shows the rising expectations among car buyers for a seamless personal customer experience across the whole buying lifecycle, both online and offline, putting customer individual preferences at the heart of offers and services. While the younger generation (18-34 year olds) has a higher affinity with online channels, the study reveals that even ‘digital natives’ want physical touch-points for purchase, ownership and repurchase so dealers remain crucial to the selling process. Customers demand technical expertise from dealers and expect more personalized and frequent communication between purchase and delivery. Half expect at least weekly notifications on delivery updates while the majority (58%), want to be able to adjust their order after the initial purchase. Most consumers (80%), interested in connected car features, are prepared to allow access to their data, provided there is transparent information on how it’s used – showing high levels of trust in OEMs. Nearly all (99%) of customers who feel very informed about the use of their data are satisfied with their dealer or OEM. However, surprisingly as many as 37% in mature markets say they have not been contacted at all by their dealer or manufacturer in the last year. 
	Personalized experience driving demand for further data sharing between OEMs and dealers ""Accustomed to personalized services and an experience that combines on and offline channels in other sectors such as retail, consumers are demanding the same in the automotive industry both pre- and post-car purchase. Digital communication channels such as social media, insights into behavior made possible by data analytics, and the desire for added services means OEMs and dealers should provide such an experience,"" Kai Grambow, Global Head of Automotive at Capgemini, commented. “However, in order to achieve this, there must be a shift in mentality away from the segregation of manufacturing, sales and aftercare. Currently there is little data sharing between OEMs and dealers – but this is a real opportunity for the industry. OEMs and dealers need to co-operate and use the right analytical technology to provide a more comprehensive 360 degree customer experience.” 
	Growing demand for Connected and Autonomous cars reveals how OEMs can innovate The report also details a significant appetite for advanced new technologies and connected services, providing OEMs and dealers with fresh opportunities, but also challenges. Half of consumers (47%) want to use or are already using connected car features, with over three quarters (80%) of these saying it is important for their next car. However, the threat of a cyber attack is still a significant concern for some consumers (38%), who say it is a reason not to use these features. Looking ahead, half of all consumers surveyed (49%) would be interested in buying a car from technology giants like Apple or Google, even if they are currently satisfied with their current brand. This increases to 65% among younger customers and those in the growth markets - including China (74%) and India (81%), compared to more mature markets such as the UK (26%) and the US (29%). Consumers, particularly in the younger age category, are equally willing to pay significantly more for autonomous driving with 79% of respondents expressing interest – rising to 95% in growth markets compared to mature markets (68%). Positive benefits such as stress reduction and safety are seen to outweigh the negatives.

Other key report findings show that: 

		A wider variety of online sources are utilized when choosing a car, with dealer/manufacturer websites (49%), search engines (43%) and traditional dealerships (48%) now supplemented by web forums (19%), social media pages (12%) and smartphone apps (9%)  
		The use of more varied and non-traditional online information sources is particularly driven by the Asian markets (India/China), where 80% are significantly influenced by positive social media comments  
		The physical dealership still plays a critical role for consumers, with 95% visiting one or more dealerships before purchase as people still want a tactile experience when buying a car   
		Consumers want instantaneous personalized online services when buying a car and for post-sale experience too: 
				95% expect a response to requests within 24 hours; for growth markets, 69% want one in less than four hours   
		While consumers desire more personalized on and offline services, 45% have concerns over data privacy.   
		There is a strong correlation between customer satisfaction and loyalty particularly for dealers: 
				Only 10% of customers, not satisfied at all, say they would likely or very likely buy their next car from the same dealer. 87% of highly satisfied customers would purchase the same brand again and 85% would buy from the same dealer.    
	Research Methodology  
 Cars Online 2015 is Capgemini’s annual research into consumer behavior and expectations across the entire car purchase lifecycle (including interest and purchase through to ownership and re-purchase). It also covers consumer views on the innovation areas of “connected vehicles”, “autonomous driving” and alternative “mobility services”. This year’s 16th annual edition of the report, had 7,553 consumers participate in the survey. All respondents were “in-market”, planning to buy or lease a car in the next 12 months. Countries represented were Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US). Capgemini worked with FreshMinds, an insight and innovation consultancy, to conduct this survey. All analysis and interpretation of the data was done by Capgemini. The research was conducted in June 2015.

NEW YORK -- A Pace University student and captain of the football team has come under fire for a derogatory photo that has surfaced online, reports CBS New York and the school newspaper The Pace Chronicle 

. 

The photo appears to have come from the app Snapchat and is captioned as, ""The Grand Wizard."" The person in the photo, senior Tyler Owens, is covered in the confederate flag and making the Nazi salute. 

""We are shocked that a student in an athletic leadership role would pose for a photo wrapped in a Confederate flag making a Nazi salute,"" Evan R. Bernstein, Anti-Defamation League New York Regional Director said in a statement Friday. 

The Pace Chronicle is reporting that the photo in question was reportedly released to the media by a group of African-American students. The group of students said in an email to the Chronicle that they received the picture in real time via Snapchat this past week after there were rumors the photo was three years old. 

The Chronicle is reporting that Owens' ex-girlfriend has denied leaking the photo. 

""I would never do something like this to [Owens] or his team,"" she said to the Chronicle. ""I would never sabotage anyone's future or their team this way. I had nothing to do with it and from what the news is saying the picture was taken a couple of years ago, when I did not know Owens.""

5836,"The toughest blow to Nathan Coulter-Nile in his career so far, losing a likely World Cup berth due to a serious hamstring injury, could serve as the jolt he needed to cement his position among Australia's elite fast-bowlers. 

London: The toughest blow to Nathan Coulter-Nile in his career so far, losing a likely World Cup berth due to a serious hamstring injury, may serve as the jolt he needs to cement his position among Australia's elite fast-bowlers.

With Mitch Johnson rested for the one-day series in England, the West Australian is, despite only being 27, the oldest fast-bowler in Australia's squad.

The first two one-dayers of last summer featured stand-out performances from the two pacemen seemingly vying for one spot in Australia's 15-man squad: first Coulter-Nile with 4-48, then Josh Hazlewood with 5-31.

It was during the third game of the series in November that Coulter-Nile suffered the hamstring injury that kept him from playing again until after Australia's final World Cup squad was named in early January. Being left out – for Hazlewood, effectively – was ""absolutely shattering"".

But rather than just brood about what could have been, Coulter-Nile instead sought to examine how to minimise the chances of injury hampering him again.

One early realisation was that he was about five kilograms heavier than he should have been at the time of his injury.

""I didn't really realise what it took to compete at the top level and perform consistently,"" he said. ""I'd always perform and get injured or get dropped or something like that. When I missed the World Cup, it really hurt me a lot and I thought, 'I really want to do this, this is something I really want to do', and from then on I was really strict with my diet, really strict with my training and I saw the rewards at the end of the season.

""You can never put your finger exactly on it [cause of the injury], but hamstrings are used to decelerate the body in a lot of ways, especially when you're getting over that front leg and bracing that back leg ... so, if you're carrying an extra five kilos every time you do it, it's putting more strain through your body.

""I've tried to really trim that down where I didn't need it so I can keep my strength up and a lot of that comes down to diet really, so it wasn't really fitness or anything like that. It was just cutting a few things out. Last [season], I played a lot of cricket at the playing weight I'm at now and didn't get injured, so probably good signs.""

Rather than replicate the vegan diet of fellow paceman Peter Siddle – ""I will not be cutting out meat, ever"" – shedding starchy carbohydrates has been enough to drop those five kilos without the need to change his fitness regimen.

Because of Coulter-Nile's battles with injuries, he has eschewed the notion of long-term goals, even for events as close as six months away such as next year's World Twenty20.

""I don't have any long-term goals because I've never been on the park long-term,"" he said. ""I'm just looking at the next game, this series, hopefully win this series 5-0 and then move on.""

Coulter-Nile reckoned his bowling was best suited to limited-over games, but nevertheless said his primary goal was making his debut in Tests, a format for which he has come no closer than 12th man.

""I enjoy T20, one-day cricket ... I think they're probably the best things,"" he said.

""Test cricket is probably the pinnacle. That's what everyone wants to play and I enjoy watching it the most, but obviously T20 and one-day cricket is what fans want to watch. That's where the money is, so it's probably not a bad one to be good at.""

A towering animation display filled the main stage during the British DJs' headline performance, while dozens of inflatable balls bounced across the crowd. 

Their live set capped off Bestival's official fancy-dress day, based around this year's Summer of Love theme. 

Despite gloomy forecasts, approximately 50,000 revellers enjoyed an Isle of Wight site bathed in sunlight at the sold-out festival. 

House of Pain were earlier revealed as the weekend's surprise booking, sending the field at Robin Hill into a frenzy with their classic anthem Jump Around. 

In mid-afternoon, The Chuckle Brothers gave their catchphrase ""to me, to you"" a dance remix during a high-tempo twenty minute appearance in front of a packed tent. 

Paul Chuckle told the Press Association: ""It was the biggest crowd we have ever worked to. 

""It was wonderful, there was actually a lot more people there than go to see Rotherham United, our team."" 

Saturday's most unique moment came from 73-year-old musician Arthur Brown, who attached electrodes to his head, broadcasting his brain waves onto the stage screens. 

Away from the music, the event's second fancy-dress parade, featuring 10ft giraffe puppets and schools of performers dressed as fish, danced its way around the main arena. 

Singer Kate Tempest even brought politics to the stage, announcing her support for newly elected Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and telling fans they were witnessing the ""summer of change"". 

Hampshire Police put out a warning via Twitter about a ""yellow powder substance"" that had made several festival-goers unwell. 

They reported that both arrests and thefts were so far down from last year's event.

1634,") - Oncology researchers must ""lace up our running shoes,"" to keep up with the fast pace of lung cancer research, said Dr. David R. Gandara, Professor of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, director, Thoracic Oncology Program, Senior Advisor to the Director, UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center, Sacramento, Calif. 

Dr. Gandara introduced the press conference panel that focused exclusively on the science of lung cancer research and noted that it is unlikely that there will be a single solution to defeating lung cancer. But recent research shows that investigators are refining the concept of ""bench to bedside"" and that the pace of bringing laboratory discoveries into the clinic is accelerating. 

""The evolution of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subtyping from histologic to molecular based, integration of predictive biomarkers for genomically defined therapies into clinical practice, and translation of improved understanding to immune-biology into checkpoint immunotherapies are all examples of 'bench to bedside,'"" he said. ""Further multidisciplinary collaboration and increasingly international collaboration are imperative to rapid scientific advancement of lung cancer research and treatment. Already, precision medicine based on molecular characteristics of the tumor has dramatically changed the life prospect for many lung cancer patients, and there is much more to come.""

Adding Monoclonal Antibody to Chemotherapy Treatment Does Not Improve Overall Survival

Between 2007 and 2013, the research team led by Dr. Wakelee enrolled 1,501 patients with NSCLC. The study randomized patients to receive either chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy with bevacizumab every three weeks for one year. 

Patients with resected stage IB (  4 centimeters) to IIIA (American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 6th Edition) NSCLC were enrolled within six to 12 weeks of surgery and stratified by chemotherapy regimen, stage, histology, and sex. All patients were to receive adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of a planned four cycles of every three week cisplatin at 75 mg/m2 

The research randomized patients 1:1 to arm A (chemotherapy alone) or arm B, adding bevacizumab at 15 mg/kg every three weeks starting with cycle 1 of chemotherapy and continuing for one year. Post-operative radiation therapy was not allowed. The study had 85 percent power to detect a 21 percent reduction in the overall survival (OS) hazard rate with a one-sided 0.025-level test. The addition of bevacizumab to adjuvant chemotherapy failed to improve survival for patients with surgically resected early stage NSCLC. 

""The study highlights the importance of randomized trials to prove -- or disprove -- the utility of drugs in different stages of disease,"" Dr. Wakelee said. ""With the development of other active agents in metastatic lung cancer, it will be important to investigate them fully in earlier stages and not assume the benefit seen in advanced stage will also be proven in earlier stages, though we can remain hopeful.""

Stopping Smoking Reduces Mortality in Low-Dose CT Screening Volunteers

Dr. Pastorino and his team analyzed 3,318 heavy smokers enrolled in LDCT screening efforts. Subjects were divided into two groups: current smokers and former smokers, the latter including ex-smokers at the time of baseline screening and those who stopped smoking during the screening period. 

Dr. Pastorino developed this study because, while screening programs like the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) achieved a 7 percent reduction in mortality from any cause with LDCT screening, no study previously examined the impact of smoking habits on screening outcome. 

After following up with enrolled patients, Pastorino's team noted 151 deaths among the smoking group and 109 deaths among those who had stopped smoking. Compared with the group of current smokers, those who stopped smoking had a 23 percent reduction in mortality. 

""Stopping smoking is associated with a significant reduction of the overall mortality of heavy smokers enrolled in LDCT screening programs,"" he reported. ""The benefit of stopping smoking appears to be three to five-fold greater than the one achieved by earlier detection in the NLST trial.""

New Study Reveals Novel Mechanisms of TKI Resistance

A team led by Dr. Daniel SW Tan, Consultant, Medical Oncology, National Cancer Centre Singapore and Clinician Scientist Fellow at the Genome Institute of Singapore, undertook a study performing whole exome and RNA-sequencing to determine genomic architecture of treatment naïve EGFR mutant lung cancers, (N=9, 47 sectors), as well as to elucidate mechanisms of resistance from analysis from a series TKI resistant biopsies. 

He found that EGFR mutations consistently occur in trunks and that these tumors generally had a low-mutation burden across the exome (median 48, Range 9-98). The team also observed short trunks and high clonal diversity amongst East Asian lung cancer patients. Trunk mutations are found across all regions of a particular tumor, whereas private or branch mutations are found only in certain parts of the tumor. 

Multiregion sequencing further identified co-existing driver trunk alterations as a possible mechanism for primary resistance in EGFR TKI, which is seen in 10-20 percent of patients with activating EGFR mutations. 

""It is likely that additional subgroups within T790M positive and negative patients such as those with high mutation burden, will further emerge, and may form the basis for novel therapeutic approaches including immunotherapy,"" Dr. Tan said.

EGFR Inhibitor Cetuximab Study Supports a Biomarker-Driven Strategy for Particular Patients

Analysis of a large Phase III trial (S0819) investigating the addition of a monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) suggests that squamous cell lung cancer patients with tumors positive for the EGFR gene copy number (FISH) have a survival benefit, while non-squamous histology patients and those EGFR FISH-negative derive no survival advantage. 

Dr. Roy Herbst, Ensign Professor of Medicine, Professor of Pharmacology, Chief of Medical Oncology, Director, Thoracic Oncology Research Program, Associate Director for Translational Research, Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Conn. presented the research on behalf of SWOG, a National Cancer Institute-funded national group, and the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN).

Previous research demonstrated that cetuximab moderately increases survival in patients with advanced NSCLC. 

""Our prior work suggested that EGFR gene copy number measured by fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) could identify those patients most likely to benefit from adding cetuximab,"" Herbst said. 

Patients eligible for this Phase III trial had newly diagnosed Stage IV NSCLC. Patients with controlled brain metastases were allowed entry. The study required all patients to have tumor tissue available for molecular testing, including EGFR FISH, which was a co-primary endpoint of the trial. Randomization was stratified by appropriateness for bevacizumab treatment, smoking status, and M-substage. The co-primary objectives were progression-free survival (PFS) in EGFR-FISH positive (FISH+) patients and overall survival (OS) in the overall study population (OSP). 

""Squamous cell carcinoma is a minority subtype of lung cancer for which we have seen few new targeted therapies in the last 20 years. These data are hypothesis generating, suggesting that EGFR FISH is a potential biomarker that can be used for study of cetuximab or similar drugs in the future,"" Herbst said. ""These data support using this biomarker for determining who should receive an EGFR antibody inhibitor with chemotherapy, within the squamous subgroup.""

EGFR IHC and FISH Correlative Analyses (SQUIRE trial)

Analysis showed no consistent trend or obvious cut-points for the relationship between either overall survival or progression-free survival with EGFR protein across the range of IHC values when comparing treatment arms. Archived tumor tissue with evaluable results for exploratory EGFR FISH analysis was available for 51.0 percent of patients. Of these patients, 208 patients (37.3 percent) had increased EGFR gene copy number (FISH positive). The study did observe a trend for greater necitumumab benefit in EGFR FISH positive patients. Treatment HR for FISH positive and negative patients were 0.70 and 1.02 for OS, and 0.71 and 1.04 for PFS. However, the interaction of EGFR gene copy number gain with treatment was not statistically significant for either OS or PFS. 

Hirsch concluded that the analysis of EGFR protein expression did not identify consistent trends related to efficacy outcomes across the range of IHC values. However, EGFR gene copy number gain showed a trend for a more favorable HR. Both biomarkers, however, and particularly the FISH biomarker, showed sufficient potential trends to be investigated further in future trials.

The press briefing was moderator by Dr. Paul A. Bunn, Jr., former IASLC CEO, Distinguished Professor, Division of Medical Oncology at the University of Colorado Cancer Center of the Univ. of Colorado School of Medicine.

2233,"When Cape Cod National Seashore was on the cusp of creation, officials reached out to the Paysons, ardent supporters of the park. They said they wanted to build a comfort station on Pochet Island, which the family had owned for centuries. “Over our dead bodies,” Erica Parra, a member of the family, recalled them saying. “But let’s work something out.” What the family decided was to keep the middle of the island - although they promised not to build new structures there –and they gave the federal government the rest. And they put up signs, which are still up, that welcome everyone to the island. “The family feels very strongly you should share,” Parra said. “Loads of people come out and use the island.” And that sentiment fits right in with the mission of Celebrate Our Waters, a weekend sponsored by the Orleans Pond Coalition that educates and showcases the town’s watery wealth. “When I joined the OPC Board, I knew, there were many special places in Orleans that were unknown to me. But I did know Pochet Island, and I knew many people in Orleans did not,” said Fran McClennen. “In creating the Celebrate our Waters weekend, one of the goals always has been to offer opportunities for people to experience many special places on and around our ponds and estuaries. The assumption behind Celebrate our Waters is that if people can experience and appreciate the special places we have here in Orleans, they will want to preserve and care for them.” For the first time in the weekend’s six-year history a tour of Pochet will be among the free 50 or so water-related events offered across the town, Sept. 18 through Sunday, Sept. 20. “From the beginning of Celebrate our Waters, I have wanted to find a way for people to experience Pochet Island. Not only is it extraordinarily beautiful but it illustrates how a family who owned and cared for this island made it available for others to enjoy – forever,” McClennen said. In the past, it was difficult to find a way out to the island as it is a bit isolated, but this year the pond coalition is working with Orleans Conservation Trust and the Payson family to offer a tour that melds ecology and history. The Pochet Island walk (reservations are required) is scheduled for Sunday at 9 a.m. and it’s not for the faint-hearted. It’s approximately 5 miles round trip, often through loose sand and changing topography. If folks want to go they should pack a lunch and plenty of water, and bring an extra pair of socks in case their feet get wet while reaching the island from Nauset Beach. Page 2 of 2 - The beginning of the walk, past the dunes, will be led by Kris Ramsey, former director of the Orleans Conservation Trust, and will focus on the natural world and all the species that call the narrow barrier beach home. The second leg of the journey will be on the 8-square-mile island and will be led by a member of the Payson family. Samuel Russell Payson, Parra’s great great grandpa, bought the island- as well as Hog, Sampson, Little Pochet and the tip of Barley Neck,for $3500 in 1885. One of the houses on the island is even older than that. It was built in 1680 and floated from Chatham in 1730. “You can still see traces of how they got it up the bank,” said Parra. Parra said Samuel Payson built another house in 1886 because his wife wanted a “decent” house. Pigs had been kept in the old one. “So that was why the new house was built,” she said. “Because she didn’t like sleeping where the pigs had been sleeping.” In addition to the historic homes, and the wealth of stories behind them, there are buildings, such as the rough house, that are linked to the history of the town as a whole. The rough house was once on Nauset Beach where it used to protect those who were shipwrecked, and one of the original Life Saving Stations was on Little Pochet – an island the Paysons gave to the town. Although Orleans, and the Cape has changed, the island has stayed much as it was hundreds of years ago. Parra chuckled at the memory of one family member suggesting to the others (there are more than a 100 relatives) that they really should build a golf course on the island. “You could hear the explosion,” she said with a laugh.    ",dc7a59d4-7cba-4ac9-8a91-7a84c5b33b3e,News,2015-09-09T15:08:29Z,Wicked Local Chatham,Celebrate Our Waters in Orleans includes Pochet Island Tour,0.0,News

Foundation grants $11.6 million for two pilot programs to give communities more access to job training and upskilling resources.

BATTLE CREEK, Mich. 

""All parents deserve the opportunities and training to obtain good jobs, advance in their careers and provide financially secure homes for their children,"" said La June Montgomery Tabron, president and CEO of WKKF. ""We believe working with these 14 organizations and their supporting partners in the community will provide greater access to safe, quality jobs and the skills and training to help parents earn a family-sustaining income and increase the opportunities for their children to succeed in school and in life.""

Quality, affordable and flexible child care is one of the critical support services that parents need in order to succeed at work. The seven STEPS grantees include workforce development organizations that are leading and formally partnering with early childhood education providers, identifying unemployed mothers who are seeking jobs and already have their children enrolled in early child care, pre-K programs or elementary schools. Designed to change conditions for both parents and their children, this effort provides unemployed mothers with access to short-term, demand-driven, sector-based workforce training, education and support that can lead to employment. 

""United Way of Greater Cincinnati 

The seven MOVE UP grantees include workforce development organizations that are partnering with employers to offer incumbent working parents in low-wage, entry-level jobs access to training programs, career development and work supports, like child care and transportation, so that they can move up in their careers and provide better opportunities for their children. 

""We are excited to have the opportunity to partner with the Kellogg Foundation on this important pilot initiative, which is very much in line with our mission of transforming lives through employment,"" said Phil Weinberg 

Both pilot study programs are grounded in WKKF's commitment to supporting community-led solutions that help remove the barriers to economic security faced by lower-income families and families of color. Parents who are financially secure can better support their families and help ensure their children can succeed in school and in life.

STEPS and MOVE UP are part of the foundation's efforts to increase opportunities for employment in quality jobs. Another recent example is the foundation's participation in the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative, an employer-led coalition designed to create meaningful employment for America's opportunity youth. There are currently 5.5 million opportunity youth in America – those youth ages 16-24 who are neither employed nor in school.

Through these and other community partnerships, WKKF aims to ensure that parents have access to every available resource – including job training, opportunities for growth and family-friendly work environments – that helps them better support their families and save for their children's futures.

986,"A man involved in a road rage incident will await a psychiatric report before sentencing in December. 
             
A man will stay in custody at Hillmorton Hospital awaiting sentence after admitting running down a man in a road rage incident. 
 
During the remand, a psychiatric report will be prepared on how to deal with 51-year-old Andrew George McDaniel at his sentencing on December 15. 
 
The report was ordered along with a report on McDaniel's suitability for home detention when he pleaded guilty to five charges in the Christchurch District Court on Tuesday. 
 
The Swannanoa property developer was charged with injuring a man with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, and wilfully illtreating a dog by injuring it causing it pain to the extent that it was necessary to destroy the animal to end its suffering. He aced separate charges of assault, driving with excess breath-alcohol and careless driving. 
 
The most serious charges arose from an incident that took place on March 23, at the Eyre River crossing in Downs Rd, near Rangiora. 
 
McDaniel was driving a dark-grey four-wheel-drive Nissan. 
 
A man out walking the family's 10-month-old puppy, with his wife and two children at about 5.45pm, signalled to McDaniel to slow down when he drove out of the river crossing. 
 
McDaniel then manoeuvred the car with a series of u-turns to try to knock the man down. 
 
The man tried to avoid the vehicle by jumping over a fence but was struck and then the puppy was hit by the car as it drove away from the scene. 
 
The man received treatment for cuts to his hands from the fence, cuts and bruises on his head and injuries to his shoulder and ankle. The puppy was put down.

6255,"While the 28 runs primarily as a tourist attraction, Lisbon's other main tram line, the 15, gets strong local traffic, too. The 15's only real tourist appeal is that it serves Belem, which has a few attractions - other than that, the line serves local neighborhoods to the west of Lisbon. Since the Metro doesn't run out here, the 15 is the only option for many people, but...this ain't no metro. Indeed, it can hardly even be considered ""light rail"" with all its mixed traffic sections. But see for yourself - let's take a look.
Shoot, we just missed the Coca-Co...I mean tram. That tour tram got in the way of my picture of the stop at Praca Figueira. Another tram coming in. As you can see, the 15 doesn't use the historic trams of the 28. Instead, this line uses modern, articulated vehicles. They make for a much smoother ride than the old ones, but they do lack a certain character. Regardless, these trams have automatic announcements as well as ticket validators at each entrance, so all doors can open. It's kind of an honor system, but it does speed up boarding.
These screen pictures never come out well on my camera. All the doors are controlled by buttons pushed by passengers who want to get in or out. Looking down the tram. Another shot, this time turning. Might as well get the obligatory ""tram inception"" photo out of the way now. The line starts at Praca Figueira (Figueira Square), right near Rossio Station. The vehicle wasn't too crowded as we turned immediately onto R. dos Fanqueiros, running through the historic Baixa neighborhood. This part of the route was mixed traffic, and it was odd being on such a modern tram running through such an old neighborhood. We then turned onto the north side of Praca de Comercio, Lisbon's massive riverfront square, and picked up some more passengers.
Lots of crisscrossing tram tracks here. Crossing over the east-west 28 tracks. The massive Praca de Comercio. A tram in the Baixa - not the one I took, obviously. Heading down Rua de Arsenal, we reached a rotary and twisted around it. From there, we had our own bus/tram lane segregated from the road. After a stop at Cais do Sodre Station (where a bunch of people got on), we followed the Cascais suburban line to its next stop, Santos, which was close by.
Going around the rotary. That's Cais do Sodre station...but it's kinda hard to tell. Some cranes. A tram at Cais do Sodre. The surroundings got industrial from there until we turned onto Av. 24 de Julio. Though we still had our own lane along this section, it wasn't totally segregated anymore. We then turned onto R. 1o de Maio, going under the incredibly high 25 de Abril Bridge. We were in mixed traffic now, the road lined with apartments and some businesses.
A Christ the Redeemer-esque statue across the Tagus River. A view of the bridge! Gosh, that bridge is high up. A tram yard. Another view of the bridge through some trees. The street widened and became Rua da Junqueira. We had our own segregated lane now, running in the middle of the road. After two large buildings, it got more residential, with small apartments lining the street. The apartments eventually became tighter and the road got narrower - we were in mixed traffic now.
A big sculpture in a garden. After going by a garden, the street became R, Belem. And a few blocks after that, we entered a turnaround loop.

982,"Victor Vito was the pick of the All Blacks' pack with a busy performance against a determined Namibia in London. 
             
 OPINION: The All Blacks continued their patchy Rugby World Cup form with a frustrating win over Namibia. Here's how we rated the individual efforts. 
 
 Colin Slade 6.5  
 
Proficient positioning at the back. Joined backline when he could and produced a couple of sweet passes. Got 11 minutes at first-five at start of second half before being subbed. 
 
 Nehe Milner-Skudder 8  
 
A big step up from nervous opener against the Pumas. Two tries made him the official man of the match. Some good steps and busted first tackle every time. Sweet hands to gift Codie Taylor the last try. 
 
 Malakai Fekitoa 6  
 
A mixed effort. Couple of nice touches to keep the ball alive. Quiet night with his own running game but showed right instincts to stay on Sonny Bill Williams' shoulder for a good try. Guilty of falling off the tackle that gave Namibia their try. 
 
 Sonny Bill Williams 8  
 
Carried on where he left off with his exciting cup opener. Showed his distribution is more than just offloads with some good wide passes. But pop-pass for Fekitoa's  try was sublime and produced a beautiful flick off the ground to keep movement alive for Skudder's second try. 
 
 Julian Savea 7  
 
Confidence-booster for the big wing who finally broke his 2015 test try drought with a brace. Wasn't given a lot of space out wide but went looking for work constantly and was a danger on the inside channel. Couple of drops under the high ball contributed to a sloppy second spell by the All Blacks. 
 
 Beauden Barrett 6.5  
 
Competent control at No 10. Showed blistering speed and eye for gap for his try. Good line kicking but guilty of over-doing chip kicks at times. Goalkicking still a concern with five out of nine attempts. 
 
 TJ Perenara 5  
 
Had an armchair ride behind a dominant pack. Content to move the ball with his passing and ignored his running game. Subbed after 47 minutes.

 Victor Vito 8  
 
The pick of the pack. Looks comfortable at No 8 and showed good control at back of scrum. A lineout force and busy in all areas. Set the tone with his opening try and his game has real momentum at the moment. 
 
 Same Cane 7  
 
Handled the captaincy well, vocal and imploring his side to keep some shape against a committed opponent who were determined to slow the game down. Plenty of continuity play. Held the leadership when Richie McCaw was introduced for final quarter. 
    
 Jerome Kaino 6.5  
 
Solid as ever. Wasn't a night of huge tackle counts as All Blacks dominated position but Kaino made his hits count. Subbed for McCaw after 61 minutes. 
 
 Sam Whitelock 6.5  
 
Got an early lineout steal and was good at the restarts – an area of concern in the All Blacks game lately but one where they got plenty of practice. 
 
 Luke Romano 7.5  
 
Strong display with his physical approach. Asked to go the distance and was still firing at the finish. Couple of bruising runs and effective cleanout work at breakdown. 
 
 Charlie Faumuina 6.5  
 
A pleasing hour's work by the tighthead who has been short of rugby over recent months. Anchored a dominant scrum and popped up around the fringes as well as doing the grind.

 Codie Taylor 7  
 
Showed the All Blacks have strength in the hooking department. Accurate lineout throwing and solid in the scrums. Popped up increasingly with his running and rewarded with the last try, looming out wide. 
 
 Ben Franks 6.5  
 
Cost three points with an early penalty. Made up for that by scampering back to tidy up ugly situation in front of All Blacks' posts. Overpowered his opposite at scrum time. 
 
 RESERVES  
 
 Keven Mealamu  Not used 
 
 Wyatt Crockett 6  
 
Got on after 63 minutes and had a busy time amidst scrum resets. Knock-on when appearing in the backline. 
 
 Tony Woodcock   Not used 
 
 Kieran Read 6  
 
On after 51 minutes for Sam Whitelock. Proved he's able to be locking cover in an area where the team are travelling light and looking for versatility. 
 
 Richie McCaw 6  
 
On after 61 minutes for Kaino and took on blindside duties. Quiet time as game spluttered through frustrating final quarter. 
 
 Tawera Kerr-Barlow 6  
 
Got some much-needed game time in the black jersey with his last test almost a year ago. Content to be the link and produced a good option with a blindside pass for Savea's second try. 
 
 Ma'a Nonu 6  
 
On after 61 minutes for Williams to notch his 99th test. One good bust but struggled for impact as the game failed to flow. 
 
 Ben Smith 6  
 
On after 51 minutes for Slade to operate at fullback. Showed his nose for the try line by being in the right place at the right time.

Thus, I was listening to the below song, which is interspersed with various soundbytes from teens being interviewed.  And at 1:42, a girl says ""I just wish that there's no such thing as farting -- that the world could just be, like, perfect -- and everybody could get along.""

 The rapidly changing retail market could favour independent health retailers and eco brands, a leading retail analyst has suggested.  
Martin Watkins, head of retail and business insights at analysts Nielsen, said there was “no going back” to the retail model that dominated the pre-internet era. 
 
Speaking at a recent Soil Association Trade briefing, Watkins said that the new landscape was characterized by features such as ‘Channel shifts’, ‘retailer disruption’, ‘small store shopping’, ‘digital and disloyal’, ‘low growth in FMCG’ and ‘spending less, saving less’. 
 
The single biggest change in retail, he said, was “the shift of spend away from large store formats”. That change in behaviour is boosting footfall on local high streets to the potential benefit of independents. 
 
Meanwhle, with an improving economic outlook, health has been rising up the consumer agenda. 60% of shoppers polled by Neilsen said they were “actively looking for healthier options” when food shopping, with 33% saying their main focus is “longevity and maintaining good health” (tellingly, in 2015 “reducing sugar intake” has replaced “getting my five-a-day” as consumers’ number one health priority). 
 
“34% would be willing to switch to a more environmentally friendly brand, and 23% to more a environmentally friendly retailer” 
 
Eco and organic brands are also likely to benefit from shoppers’ “wider ethical expectations”, says Nielsen. 67% of shoppers said they like to support local businesses and farmers, while 34% would be willing to switch to a more environmentally friendly brand, and 23% to more a environmentally friendly retailer.",d5f22844-432d-493d-98f7-6f2515f05797,Blog,2015-09-24T06:33:57Z,www.naturalproductsonline.co.uk,New retail landscape could favour health stores and eco brands,1.0,Blog

7089,"Ordinary Blessings: Letters from Prison, Tales of Freedom.Via Nicole Alexanderon Sep 16, 2015	“We still counted happiness and health and love and luck and beautiful children as ‘ordinary blessings.'” ~ Joan Didion I was recently mesmerized by the charming voice of prison inmate, Saint James Harris Wood, in a series of letters he wrote to The Sun Manuscript Editor, Colleen Donfield. The letters—sent over a 10 year period—were published in the February 2015 issue of The Sun Magazine, and are entitled Your Wretched Correspondent. Wood is serving a twenty-two-year sentence in California for second-degree robbery. He allegedly robbed banks and other venues with a toy gun to support his drug habit. In the shower the other morning, I was considering what it would be like to live in prison (where you are not even guaranteed a shower after a seven hour stint of dishwashing in a gnarly prison kitchen) as I was staring out the window to a springtime blue sky and green trees from a bright, clean bathroom. My soul seems somehow to understand the feeling of being trapped. I shuddered to think of the prison walls, the shared showers and the overall wretched environment. I imagined how an inmate might feel standing in a private shower across from an open window, a soft breeze and sunlight streaming through, and the ecstasy of other simple events like waking up each morning in a bed of one’s own (something that my non-morning-person self does not currently delight in), placing your bare feet on a clean floor, choosing your breakfast, and on and on and on (I can only imagine). Wood writes, “One of the most jarring parts of being in prison is waking up. Every morning it comes crashing down: the smells, the walls, the noise, the irrefutable fact of being trapped, and the memory of the events that led me here” (p. 38). He doesn’t seem to feel sorry for himself though (well, maybe sometimes he does, I mean, who wouldn’t?); instead, he accepts full responsibility for his current predicament and I think this sense of unexpected grace coupled with a raw sense of humor and willingness to look at himself are among the qualities of his writing voice that I am drawn to. “The first ten years behind bars didn’t change me as much as they might have a normal person. Even though my life is in ruins, a complete catastrophe, a profound debacle (get out your thesaurus, look up ‘fucked up,’ and add to this sentence), right from the start I figured I could use the time to write and maybe regain my foolish soul.” (p.45). Reading this, I am reminded of the beauty and blessings in my life. I have to say, though, that I am not a big fan of the word “blessings” because of the way it is sometimes used, as in “I am so blessed!” to have such and such (insert: brand new jeep for my 25th birthday…one of the more obnoxious “so blessed” offenses I have come across), as if those of us who don’t have such things are not blessed? Cursed? I refer to blessings here in a more “everyday” sense (“ordinary blessings,” in Joan Didion’s words): Blue sky. Green trees. Song birds outside my window. I digress. That morning in the shower, before I glanced through the bathroom window and noticed the beauty around me, I had been fretting over things that now seem like luxuries. How much of our lives are wasted by stressing over things that might be considered a luxury, a blessing, to someone else, or worrying about things that are out of our control (I am a big culprit of this one) while we ignore the beauty that is all around and within us? I know it’s not all roses, but I also know that we can create our own private prisons even in the most physically appealing environments and, by the same token, inmates (or those who are physically trapped) can create freedom, space, for themselves by transcending the “little” mind—the part of the mind that keeps constant tabs on what is wrong, that keeps us feeling separate and disconnected from the source. Saint James Harris Wood inspires me by creating art, beauty, inside prison walls. If he can do that, I think we (i.e., those of us who are not in prison) can find our way too. Namaste, Saint James.   * Note: These letters were originally published in the February 2015 edition of The Sun Magazine, Issue 470.

3816,"Chapter 22: Of Lawful Oaths and Vows
1: A lawful oath is part of religious worship,[443] wherein, upon just occasion, the person swearing solemnly calls God to witness what he asserts, or promises, and to judge him according to the truth or falsehood of what he swears.[444]

2: The name of God only is that by which men ought to swear, and therein it is to be used with all holy fear and reverence.[445]Therefore, to swear vainly, or rashly, by that glorious and dreadful Name; or, to swear at all by any other thing, is sinful, and to be abhorred.[446] Yet, as in matters of weight and moment, an oath is warranted by the Word of God, under the New Testament as well as under the old;[447] so a lawful oath, being imposed by lawful authority, in such matters, ought to be taken.[448]

3: Whosoever takes an oath ought duly to consider the weightiness of so solemn an act, and therein to avouch nothing but what he is fully persuaded is the truth:[449] neither may any man bind himself by oath to any thing but what is good and just, and what he believes so to be, and what he is able and resolved to perform.[450]",65da0ddf-cdf1-4265-9613-58c49492d5cc,Blog,2015-09-12T08:00:01Z,Daily Confession,"Westminster Confession, week 37",1.0,News
2315,"The junta-stacked legislature prolongs the junta's rule after the draft constitution was widely criticised. 

Bangkok: Thailand's military has prolonged its direct rule of the country after a junta-stacked legislature voted to reject a new constitution.

The National Reform Council's rejection of Thailand's 20th constitution, by 134 votes to 105, will push back any prospect for elections and a return to civilian rule while the military maintains its firm grip over the country's often turbulent politics.

The military toppled Thailand's democratically-elected government to seize power in May last year.

Military members on the council backed away from endorsing the constitution in response to criticism of it by almost all of Thailand's political parties.

The new charter would have significantly weakened the parties, using a system where it would have been much harder for any one party to win an overall majority, forcing the formation of multi-party coalitions.

But analysts said no matter what the vote, the military would benefit.

If the charter had passed it would have enshrined a military-dominated 23-member politburo-style committee to co-exist alongside parliament that would have had the power for five years to take over at any time in what it deemed a crisis situation.

Borwornsak Uwanno, chairman of the drafting committee, said the proposed body - called the National Strategic Reform and Reconciliation Committee - would be a ""special tool"" to ensure a smooth transition to democracy and prevent future coups.

The ""no"" vote means the process of drafting another constitution will start again, delaying any election until 2017 at the earliest.

The Pheu Thai party, which was ousted from power last year, described the constitution as ""totally disregarding the sovereignty of the Thai people"".

Pheu Thai's rivals in the pro-military Democrat Party called for it to be rejected pending further discussion.

What ordinary Thais thought about it is unknown, because the military did not allow it to be debated.

A small group of protesters who defied orders not to protest were arrested on Sunday.

Thailand is currently using an interim constitution drafted by the junta last year. It gives sweeping unchecked powers to the junta led by former army commander Prayuth Chan-ocha.

Thailand has had on average a new constitution every four years since the end of the absolute monarchy in 1932.

The vote came at a time of unease in the county over the health of 87-year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej, a faltering economy and an unprecedented bombing in central Bangkok on August 17 that killed 20 people and injured 120 others. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.",56bcafc1-9fa4-46f9-a1b7-2bcbbca1a8a3,News,2015-09-06T05:57:13Z,Oberon Review,'No' vote on constitution pushes Thai elections back to 2017 at earliest,0.0,News

1626,"The Sentinel revealed yesterday that more than 60,000 people in Stoke-on-Trent don't have enough money to live on. Today, PHIL CORRIGAN continues his week-long series on the city's poverty problems with a look at the benefits system. 

ADVICE on benefits and other financial issues could help improve the lives of the poorest people in Stoke-on-Trent, according to a new report on poverty. 

The city's Hardship Commission estimates that £50 million in benefits is going unclaimed every year – which is the equivalent of £200 for every man, woman and child in the Potteries. 

In their initial report, the commissioners recommend that more efforts should be made to maximise the take-up of benefits in Stoke-on-Trent, in order to ease the hardship faced by families and individuals who are struggling to make ends meet. 

Commissioners believe that along with confusion over what they may be entitled to, claimants can also experience negative attitudes due to portrayals of them as 'scroungers'. 

Those on low-incomes are also less likely to be 'active consumers', in that they cannot shop around for better deals for things such as utilities, due to a lack of access to the internet access or a bank account. 

A Financial Inclusion Group will now build on the report and advise the Hardship Commission on ways to minimise costs and maximise income for those facing hardship. 

The report states: ""The most significant factor associated with non-take up appears to be the level and accuracy of knowledge about an entitlement and its eligibility rules, linked with the perceived cash value of the benefit when compared to the effort involved in claiming and maintaining entitlement. 

""Take-up rates can be improved by increasing the level of knowledge about entitlements and the eligibility rules and by reducing stigma and the complexity of claiming. Local initiatives are most effective."" 

Voices Of Stoke is a lottery-funded project which seeks to help residents who are facing multiple complex needs, such as through assisting them in claiming benefits. 

Andy Meakin, director of the Stoke-based project, believes that increasing an individual's income even by a small amount could make all the difference. 

Mr Meakin said: ""Being poor actually limits a person's choices. Sometimes all they have is a choice between two negatives options. 

""For example, they might not be able to afford the bus fare to get to a job interview. 

""That's why we support the recommendations in the report, such as trying to help people maximise their benefits. Something like that can enhance people's choices, by giving them just a bit more money. 

""The Hardship Commission's report highlights a lot of the issues that come through our door, particularly in terms of the increased negativity towards people on benefits. Things like Benefits Street give the impression that people are making the choice to be poor, and that they could make the choice not to be poor."" 

Mary-Anne Rapson is a carer for her son Arthur, who has special needs, and is currently dependent on benefits, including Carer's Allowance and Income Support. She believes there is a widespread lack of understanding of the difficulties faced by people reliant on welfare. 

The 41-year-old, of Sneyd Green, said: ""I tried working as a bookkeeper but there was no way I could work enough to make it worthwhile. 

""People might say that I made the choice to look after my son, rather than put him in care. I was speaking to a friend about going on holiday, and she was saying that the taxpayer should not have to pay for me to go on holiday, when she works full-time and struggles to afford things like that. 

""But what people don't understand is I'm actually saving the state hundreds of pounds a week by taking care of Arthur. It's not like I'm sat at home watching TV. And I do volunteer for Stoke-on-Trent Foodbank as well."" 

Universal Credit is set to replace the six main means-tested benefits in Stoke-on-Trent from next February. 

Abi Brown, cabinet member for finance at the city council, said: ""We will be looking at all the recommendations. The introduction of University Credit next year will be a good opportunity for us to review the way we help people understand benefits.""

3275,"Newcastle managing director Lee Charnley has apologised for the club's dreadful start to the new season. 
 
Owner Mike Ashley's right-hand man, who oversaw the appointment of head coach Steve McClaren and the club's £52million summer recruitment drive, has insisted the club's hierarchy will take ""collective responsibility"" for the failures which have resulted in only one victory from eight games to date this season - none of them in the Barclays Premier League - and an embarrassing Capital One Cup exit at the hands of Sky Bet Championship Sheffield Wednesday. 
 
In an e-mail to the club's supporters, Charnley said: ""There is no hiding from the fact that this has been a very disappointing start to our Premier League campaign, and a painful early exit from a cup competition that we were determined to give everything in this year. We apologise to you for this. 
 
""After six league games, the truth is we have not achieved the points that any of us had hoped and expected we would do. 
 
""None of us can, or will, shirk the responsibility for this situation. Now is the time for collective action, and for us to find solutions to the problems rather than allow ourselves to be consumed by them. 
 
""It is important to state that we bear collective responsibility for our position in the table. Identifying the problems in order to find the solutions is crucial, but we are not in the business of apportioning blame. We are a team, from the boardroom to the boot room, and we will respond like one. 
 
""So we have sat down as a collective - myself with Steve and his coaching team, and Steve with his players - to discuss the concerns and to look for the solutions together."" 
 
The start has piled the pressure on McClaren, whose side have lost their last four games in all competitions and face champions Chelsea and current leaders Manchester City in the next two.

5670,"The pope is arriving in Cuba, and with him runaway speculationin themedia about the impact his visit will have on Cuban society and politics—and particularly the push for greater democracy in the country.

And in the media’s defense, Pope Francis’s presence here is noteworthy. It is the third papal visit in just 17 years to a country whose population is not known for its Catholic devotion—a country where democracy was banished more than 63 years ago by two successive coups d’état: Fulgencio Batista’s in 1952 and Fidel Castro’s in 1959. Fidel’s regime was characterized in its first three decades by anti-religious policies, including the harassment of Catholic clergy, the expropriation of Church property, and the banning of religious education. Many priests were expelled from Cuba, and the Catholic lay community and Church officials who stayed behind were forced to practice their faith from cloisters in homes, churches, and vestries, always under the hostile supervision of ideologues and oppressors serving the communist power.

After Pope John Paul II traveled to Cuba in 1998, relations between the Cuban Catholic Church and the state improved significantly. The government reinstated celebrations that had been banned on the island, including Christmas and the procession of Cuba’s patron saint, Our Lady of Charity. It permitted the (limited) circulation of Church publications such as Palabra Nueva and Espacio Laical.

But for many Cubans—who tend to be more superstitious than religious—the expectations that grew out of John Paul II’s visit stemmed not from the pope’s ministry or the people’s religious vocation, but rather from the important role that the pontiff had played in Poland’s transition to democracy, a peaceful process to which millions of Cubans aspired. Hopeful Cubans overwhelmed city squares to greet the clergyman. They took as a good omen the famous phrase with which the bishop of Rome bid us farewell from the steps of his plane: “May Cuba, with all its magnificent possibilities, open itself up to the world, and may the world open itself up to Cuba.”

To date, only part of that blessing has been fulfilled: The world has opened itself up to a Cuba whose government refuses to open itself up to those it governs.

Pope Benedict XVI’s visit to Cuba in 2012 strengthened relations between the Church and the Castro government, while expanding and consolidating the Church’s presence in Cuban society. But it did not create openings for democracy or civil liberties, despite the flood of blessings, which—like his predecessor—Benedict poured equally over the wolves and the flock.

Prior to Benedict’s arrival, the Cuban government had freed political prisoners locked away as part of the 2003 judicial farce known as the Black Spring. But other Black Spring prisoners still languished behind bars, and the Castro regime chose Jaime Ortega, Havana’s cardinal, as the mediator in the release rather than involving leaders of Cuban civil society. Notably excluded from the talks were the Ladies in White, female relatives of jailed Black Spring dissidents who long campaigned for the liberation of their loved ones by attending Mass and then embarking on a ritual procession through the streets—protests that are routinely repressed through beatings and arrests, but that have aroused solidarity around the world for their defense of human rights.

Now another pope passes through Cuba, after serving as an intermediary in negotiations between the governments of Cuba and the United States that have produced a momentous development: the restoration of relations between the two countries, interrupted more than 50 years ago in the midst of the Cold War. Pope Francis speaks our language. He is from our continent.

And yet, many Cubans recognize that Francis’s visit will not make a difference in their daily lives and problems. The capital of hope awakened by John Paul II has drained away after almost two decades of no real improvements in the country’s socioeconomic and political situation, and in the spiral of poverty that stifles much of the population. Cubans today confront ever more entrenched poverty, an increasingly apathetic population, and a nation being emptied—particularly of its young people—by a growing and seemingly unstoppable emigration. Many people have discovered that the paradise they dream about is not in the infinity of the heavens, but a mere 90 miles across the sea from this hell of hardship that Cuba has become.

These considerations aren’t enough to stop the fanfare. Crowds will flock to greet Pope Francis, whether out of faith, curiosity, or official summons. For several days, autocrats will smile, the pope will bless us, religious choirs will sing, and even the staunchest atheists may express pious devotion, however artificial. After all, we are a people who have been trained against our will for over five decades in false compliance.

The day after the pontiff leaves, when the prayers have been silenced, the stands have been removed, and the facades of old buildings—painted in a hurry to temporarily cover the dirt, the ruins, and the indolence—begin to fade again under the merciless sun, thousands of Cubans will return to the rhythms imposed by survival. The government will have released more than 3,000 imprisoned criminals as a gesture of goodwill to the bishop of Rome—many will likely go on to commit the same crimes for which they were jailed. May God protect us! Political prisoners will remain captive. To the regime, they are the most dangerous.

Cubans are all too aware that papal blessings have never found fertile ground in this land, so they prefer not to place in the pope’s hands what they must pursue with their own, unless God himself should come to save them.

Of course, it would be unfair to blame the pope for our national disaster. Nor would it be right to leave the solution to our many problems to his well-intentioned prayers. But his visit to Cuba nevertheless raises the question: Who will challenge a power that has been blessed?",f8899aec-d8b0-4ef2-aa01-3d8d5616f089,News,2015-09-19T16:16:00Z,MSN News US,What Happens the Day After Pope Francis Leaves Cuba?,0.0,Blog
5398,"New York – Roger Federer insists there are no excuses for players wilting in the US Open heat after the number of retirements reached a Grand Slam record 12. 
 
After 10 men quit in the first round, Jack Sock of the United States and Uzbekistan’s Denis Istomin retired on Thursday. 
 
Despite temperatures rocketing to over 30 degrees over the first four days, in harness with crushing levels of humidity at Flushing Meadows, Federer offered no sympathy. 
 
“We’ve been here in North America for some time. It’s not like, all of a sudden, hot. I mean, it was more on the warmer side, but it’s not like impossible, to be quite honest. Really no excuse for that,” said the 34-year-old. 
 
“I think everybody should be well-prepared. I know we don’t play many best-of-five-set matches all the time, so of course the body can react funny once you exceed the two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half hours of play. 
 
“Maybe some guys already came in too tired, whatever it was. I think you have to analyze case by case. But I think other players should be so fit that heat really shouldn’t matter at that point, the ones we’ve been playing in.” 
 
The 22-year-old Sock was leading Belgium’s Ruben Bemelmans 6-4, 6-4, 3-6, 1-2 when he started cramping and was forced to retire. 
 
Sock, the 28th seed, then collapsed on court, where he was treated with ice packs and cold towels by US Open medical staff before being carried off to the shade of the Grandstand Court. 
 
Just hours later, Istomin also called it quits on Court Seven against Austrian 20th seed Dominic Thiem, who was 6-4, 6-4, 1-0 up at the time. 
 
Two women also retired in the first round, taking the total for this year’s US Open to 14. 
 
The carnage led again to suggestions that the men, who play the best of five sets, should be accorded the same protection as women players. 
 
The WTA allows a 10-minute break between the second and third sets of women’s matches when the mercury bursts through 30.1 degrees. 
 
Third seed Andy Murray, who battled through five sets to beat France’s Adrian Mannarino on Thursday, believes there is scope for men to have a similar time-out. 
 
“When it’s extremely hot and humid, it helps to have that break,” said Murray of the 10-minute rest that women players take between the second and third sets when the temperature goes above 30.1 degrees. 
 
“I don’t know exactly what it’s for. But I guess you get the chance to sort of go off and change, get under a cold shower if you want to.”

1061,"-- Field Engineers and Technicians Can Conduct RF Tests on RRH at Ground Level to Reduce Base Station OpEx -- 

MORGAN HILL, Calif., Sept. 8, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Anritsu Company introduces a CPRI RF Measurement option for its BTS Master™ handheld base station analyzer family that can significantly reduce the operational expense (OpEx) associated with troubleshooting interference at base stations. Featuring best-in-class sweep speed and unique test capabilities, the BTS Master-based CPRI RF measurement test set allows field engineers and technicians to conduct accurate RF measurements on Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) while remaining at ground level, eliminating the considerable expense and time associated with calling a tower crew to conduct interference measurements. 

With the new option installed, the BTS Master can conduct RF measurements over the fiber optic CPRI link connecting the baseband unit (BBU) and RRH. To simplify configuring the CPRI link for RF measurements, Anritsu has developed preconfigured radio setups and an auto detect function in the option. 

A sweep speed 10x faster than other solutions in its class allows the BTS Master-based CPRI RF measurement test set to capture bursty signals missed by alternative methods. Complementing the sweep speed are two unique features – the ability to tune and pan on a displayed signal, and to zoom into a particular area of interest. Faster sweep speeds and more detailed signal analysis allow field engineers and technicians to more efficiently locate the sources of interference and PIM. 

Users can conduct CPRI Spectrum and CPRI Spectrogram measurements with the test set. The overall performance and capability give operations and maintenance groups, RF performance engineers, NEM performance groups and other professionals responsible for wireless network optimization the ability to conduct all the required tests without the cost and time associated with dispatching a tower crew.    

The CPRI RF option expands the comprehensive measurement capability of the BTS Master family, which consists of the MT8820T, MT8221B and MT8222B. All the handheld base station analyzers have been specifically developed to support 2G/3G/4G wireless networks, and feature over 30 analyzers in one instrument to meet virtually every measurement need. 

Anritsu also offers a portfolio of optical transport testers to test and verify the CPRI links. These solutions leverage Anritsu's extensive optical test history and can be used to confirm the RRH is powered-up correctly, that the fibers are connected correctly, the condition and cleanliness of the optical connector, and that the link has no excess loss from the RRH to the BBU. The transport testers can also verify that the correct wavelength SFP/SFP+ modules are installed and that the modules support the rate configured.

2071,"Hewlett-Packard Co, which is splitting into two listed companies later this year, said it expects to cut another 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its enterprise business as part of its efforts to save $2.7 billion in costs.

The 76-year-old company is separating the faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations, to be called Hewlett Packard Enterprise, from its computer and printer businesses.

The expected job cuts will result in a charge of about $2.7 billion, beginning in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement on Tuesday.

""We've done a significant amount of work over the past few years to take costs out and simplify processes and these final actions will eliminate the need for any future corporate restructuring,"" Chief Executive Meg Whitman said.

The total job cuts planned by the company as part of Whitman's multi-year restructuring plan was 55,000 as of October last year. HP had more than 300,000 employees as of Oct. 31, 2014.

In the latest third quarter HP's revenue from personal computer and printer businesses, its largest, fell 11.5 percent. Enterprise services division sales dropped 11 percent, while revenue at the enterprise group rose 2 percent.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise is expected to have more than $50 billion in annual revenue and report adjusted profit of $1.85 to $1.95 per share in 2016, HP said on Tuesday.

The business is expected to report free cash flow of $2.0 billion to $2.2 billion in 2016, at least half of which is expected to be returned through dividends and share buybacks.",775f1f8d-f57b-4bb3-9f35-79c88a3210eb,News,2015-09-15T22:41:47Z,Melbourne Age,"Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 more jobs",0.0,News

That would be like paying two bucks a gallon for gas, like we do now, to forking out around $110 a gallon. 
 
Doctors prescribe Daraprim to treat a potentially deadly parasitic infection, which can affect people with compromised immune systems.

But then he started getting flack from folks like the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the HIV Medicine Association who called the increase ""unjustifiable for the medically vulnerable patient population,” which led Shkreli to say Turing will lower the price to make it more affordable while allowing the company to make a small profit.""

There was one other short car transport stint for the port years ago, according to port CEO John Walsh.
Port Canaveral expanded into bigger cargo service last year, signing a long-term agreement with Dubai-based Gulftainer. Since then, port planning for new rail connections has sparked controversy over its expansion.

85,"Family Day Trip to a Kid-Friendly Long Island Winery Sep 22 2015 By Stephanie Ogozalek Apples and pumpkins aren't the only things ripe for the tasting on Long Island this fall harvest season. The bucolic North Fork is home to many family-friendly wineries that make for great day trips. Adults can indulge in a variety of fine vintages, while children picnic and frolic in the wide-open fields. The gorgeous Sparkling Pointe Winery in Southold, Long Island is a particularly sweet destination for NYC families. Though it's less than two hours by car from Midtown Manhattan, it feels worlds away thanks to its grand opulence and wide selection of sparkling wines. And because it's just a short drive away from many other family attractions, including a working lighthouse and pick-your-own apples, you can make a fun day of it with the kids. The lovely patio overlooking the vineyard at Sparkling Pointe. Start your day with a bit of bubbly at Southold's Sparkling Pointe, the only winery in New York State that solely produces sparkling wines. Order by the glass or sample them all with a grand tasting flight, which is what I usually do (just make sure you have a designated driver). What makes this spot unique is its tasting house (not a room), which is sleek and trendy with Brazilian art adorning the walls and soothing piped-in music. Thanks to the large space and relaxed vibe, it's more of a cafe experience where you can linger, making it perfect for wine tasting with children in tow. Plop down on the low-slung couches around the fireplace or sit on the outdoor patio overlooking the grape vines in warm weather. A dedicated server pours each variety at your table, and you can purchase complementary snacks like locally made cheeses, charcuterie and chocolates that the kids are sure to gobble up. While Sparkling Pointe welcomes kids of all ages, it's smart to bring a small toy or book, or bust out your smartphone for fidgety tots. However, my 10-year-old is always content to sit quietly and savor the snacks. Opened in 2010, this winery is a popular stop on the Long Island wine trail, but if you visit soon after its 11am daily opening on a Saturday or Sunday, or any time on a weekday, you may get the place to yourself. RELATED: More Family-Friendly North Fork Wineries Climb to the top of the Horton Point Lighthouse for stunning views. After you've had your fill, the Horton Point Lighthouse is just a quick five-minute drive away. This working, 19th-century lighthouse has no age or height restrictions, so everyone in your family can try to climb to the top of the 58-foot tower, where you'll be rewarded with panoramic views of the town and the Long Island Sound. There's also a cute nautical museum with various artifacts. The lighthouse is open seasonally on weekends through Columbus Day, but the surrounding eight-acre park is accessible every day year-round. The apples are always within reach at Woodside Orchards. No North Fork autumn getaway is complete without a stop at a local farm. There are several apple-picking places in the area, but my family's favorite is Woodside Orchards in Aquebogue, about a 20-minute drive back toward the city. Woodside's semi-dwarf apple trees are only 10-feet high, so the fruit is low enough for even little kids to pluck right off the branches. Plus the adorable country store sells delicious cider, doughnuts, pies and other baked goods. RELATED: Best Pick-Your-Own Apple Farms on Long Island The ironically named Modern Snack Bar is steeped in nostalgia. Wrap up your day with dinner at Modern Snack Bar, an old-school diner opened way back in 1950. Only a few doors up the road from Woodside, it's easy to find, just look for the awesome retro neon sign. The decor is kitschy and the service friendly at this family-run eatery, which serves up comfort food staples like burgers, fries and shakes along with more sophisticated fare such as seafood entrees and roast Long Island duck. We always finish with slices of homemade pie. All photos courtesy of the respective establishments.

1490,"A Royal Marine jailed for the murder of a Taliban insurgent was ""morally disengaged"" and showed ""poor leadership"", a review has found. 

The Royal Navy internal review looked at events surrounding the shooting of an injured captive by Sgt Alexander Blackman in Afghanistan four years ago. 

It said he let professional standards ""slip to an unacceptably low level"". 

He also had difficulty switching his mindset from killing his enemy to giving them first aid, it added. 

The report also criticised his unit, 42 Commando, as a whole, saying its culture was perceived by many outside as ""overly aggressive"". 

Despite representations however, the Brigade Commander judged its approach to be ""appropriate given the circumstances"", the report said. 

'Shuffle off' 

The killing, on 15 September 2011, took place after a patrol base in Helmand province came under fire from two insurgents. 

One of the insurgents was seriously injured by gunfire from an Apache helicopter sent to provide air support and the marines found him in a field. 

Footage from another marine's helmet-mounted camera showed Blackman shooting the Afghan prisoner in the chest with a 9mm pistol. 

A court martial board heard that Blackman told him: ""There you are. Shuffle off this mortal coil."" 

Blackman, of Taunton, Somerset, was convicted of murder in 2013 and lost an appeal in May last year, but his 10-year minimum term was reduced to eight years. 

Supporters say it was manslaughter, not murder, and have launched a campaign to review the case. 

Author and campaigner Frederick Forsyth said the court martial that convicted Blackman ""stank from top to bottom"". 

His case is due to be discussed in the House of Commons later at the request of Conservative MP Richard Drax.",84adb525-0eb0-43fe-908a-2a959f792245,News,2015-09-16T09:43:10Z,BBC,Jailed marine 'morally disengaged',0.0,News
9380,"Messametito presents Fcklty of Controlled Kaos 2015
Opening night Friday 2 October Open 11am - 5pm Friday - Saturday 3 - 11 October.
Fcklty of Controlled Kaos 2015 is an extension of work that began last year, as a group of scientist were put together to explore a theory about sound. Each scientist was in agreement that the theory made sense. The scientists wrote reports as to why and how the theory could or could not be shown. The idea of a Fcklty (as pronounced by Polish science types) is that like-minded people come together to research and inquire about the same subject matter. 
Yet, more often than not, the people within a faculty will be looking at the subject form various viewpoints. It is with this idea we would like to investigate various artists working within sound, by creating a faculty we are able to learn, teach and engage with each other. This faculty will still be manned by the science types that were there from the beginning and I hope to add some more. Artists working in sound do not engage with scientists or mathematicians and engineers very often. And often these science types do not engage with the arts. By creating a large reaching faculty we the artists get the benefit of discussing ideas with scientists and scientists get the benefits of discussing creative ideas with artists. Controlled= science, kaos= art. Ideally this show is a place where the artists get to meet and engage with others working within their field. We hope that these shows will help to nourish new ideas, contacts and an environment of learning and fun. Strangely enough- when you invite scientist to play- art actually becomes more absurd. This work is an experiment and as such we will continue to learn via trial and error - a fundamental tool used in science to solve problems. “Experimental research is a systematic and scientific approach to the scientific method where the scientist manipulates variables.” Or is this Art?
  
follow via facebook: A faculty is an area where many people converge that look at the same subject matter, however often research it in a multitude of ways. This show highlights many different emerging artists using the subject of sound as a starting point. Through the study of sound, artists often engage in scientific and language studies, as well as musical history and hybridity. By using sound the artist often marries the arts and sciences back together in a submersive and interactive way that is experienced by each viewer individually.  In a world where creativity has often left the science arena artists pick up the reins again.

 EAST New Britain Development Corporation Butterflies and Metal Wizards are the new queens of ENB netball.  
On Saturday, Butterflies beat Toyota Bulls 39-25 in the A grade final.  
The Wizards’ maiden season was rewarded with a 31-25 win over Agmark Beehives. 
In the junior division, Bulls beat Beehives 17-9. 
The Butterflies, with defender Monica Kuno and shooter Crystal Mayo, executed the game plan to minute detail. Captain Vorina Kerina attributed the win to a well-organised structure in all the quarters to lead 9-6, 20-15, 30-21, 39-25. 
Yvonne Macknally, Mato, Annisha Adula, Daisy Adula, Kuno, Freda Mayo and Kerina were in devastating form all day. 
The opposition tried desperately but to no avail as silly errors and poor defence denied them any advantage. 
Provincial government spokesperson Elizabeth Malori acknowledged the women’s sport and vowed to support it in her capacity. 
“It’s good to witness young talent and mothers actively involved to promote and develop it to the next level,” Malori said.

5154,"The Red Cross says one factor makes all the difference in the fight against natural disasters. 

More lives are saved and casualties rescued by local people than outsiders in disasters around the world, a new report says.

The 2015 World Disasters Report by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) found there is an increasing need to balance the relationship between international aid agencies and locals in order to guard communities against disasters.

""There are far more lives saved and casualties rescued by local people than by outsiders,"" Australian Red Cross International programs operations manager Natasha Freeman said. ""Time and again we see local first responders saving lives and digging through the rubble. Graphic: Piktochart. ""We saw local people playing a major role in the Ebola health emergency last year. They are the ones who brought the disease under control.""

Last year, the deadliest natural disasters to hit the world took place across Asia, with earthquakes, floods and drought in China claiming more than 1900 lives, and floods and landslides in India killing 1432 people.

In total, more than 8100 people were killed and 107 million people were affected by disasters.

""So much money is pumped in in times of disaster, rather than in times of preparing for disaster ... every dollar spent in preparing for disasters will save around $18 in responding,"" Ms Freeman said. Graphic: Piktochart. Robert Butal is a local from White Sands Village in Tanna and a Red Cross project manager in Port Vila, Vanuatu, where he now lives.

He says a local understanding is critical to a disaster response, pointing to Cyclone Pam in March this year.

""Our community used us like a middle man,"" he said. ""We understand the context and the existing community structure which already exists from generation to generation.""

The annual report has been released before the first World Humanitarian Summit next year, a call to action by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to reduce human loss and suffering from crises.

Chief of the World Humanitarian Summit secretariat Dr Jemilah Mahmood says the report makes a timely contribution to the discussion around the capacity of local actors, including women and youth.

""It calls for us to re-examine the often oversimplified assumptions that underpin relationships between domestic and external humanitarian actors,"" she said.

While it is important to acknowledge the thousands of deaths that occurred last year, Ms Freeman said it should also be noted that it was the lowest disaster death toll since 1986.

""We should take heart,"" she said, ""we are getting better at this.""

Increased awareness and community preparedness have improved, while advancements in technology have also assisted in times of disaster.

The report referred to Kathmandu Living Labs (KLL), a Nepali technology and mapping collective that was founded in 2013 by local Nama Raj Budhathoki, who studied mapping in the aftermath of the Haiti earthquake.

KLL's primary tool is OpenStreetMap, which works like Wikipedia, allowing people to contribute maps. By the time the devastating earthquake struck Nepal in April this year his program had already mapped much of Kathmandu.

""This is one of the benefits of the modern age, communicating with local people through technology...and trying to leverage those technologies in the best way to benefit them in the future,"" Ms Freeman said. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.",706595ef-709a-470d-a37a-c1c35087c079,News,2015-09-23T14:15:00Z,Mandurah Mail,"Natural disasters: locals save more lives, says Red Cross before UN summit",0.0,Blog
390,"Britain's Jamie Murray endured doubles heartbreak again as he and Australian partner John Peers lost their second consecutive grand slam final at the US Open. 

Murray and Peers were runners-up at Wimbledon in July and the duo fell at the final hurdle in New York too, as French pair Nicolas Mahut and Pierre-Hugues Herbert won 6-4 6-4 to lift the title. Placed 15th in the doubles rankings, Murray won the mixed crown at Wimbledon in 2007 but Andy's older sibling is yet to add a men's doubles trophy to the family cabinet. 

""I'm starting to know what Andy felt like for a long time,"" Jamie Murray said. 
 
""We've had a great year to play at the Wimbledon final and to come here again. We're very fortunate to have done that. 
 
""We'll keep trying to get over the line and get that grand slam title."" 
 
Mahut and Herbert were slick around the net and more clinical when the opportunities arose, as one break at the end of each set was enough to seal victory in one hour and nine minutes. 
 
""I am speechless now,"" Mahut said. ""We have been working so hard for so many years to win this kind of tournament. 
 
""We lost in the final and I had another loss two years ago. We said today, 'let's go for it' and we played great. 
 
""Pierre played great in the last game. I have never seen anyone play like that in a doubles match - unbelievable shots."" 
 
Murray and Peers have played together for almost three years now and they raced out of the blocks, opening up three break points in the first game on Mahut's serve, but failed to capitalise. 
 
Two more chances arrived for the British-Australian duo at 4-4 in the first set but again the French held on, as Peers missed a simple backhand volley. 
 
The mistake perhaps preyed on Peers' mind as he then served a double fault at 5-4 before being broken to hand away the opening set. 
 
The second was even tighter, as neither side offered up a single break point until the final game, when Herbert finished off a thrilling match point to secure victory and the title. 
 
""It was pretty close,"" Murray said. 
 
""Once you get there, you want to win, don't you? It's not like we are the best players ever that will be making finals every time we step on the court. 
 
""Just you never know when you might not get back to one. So when you get back to one, obviously you want to win. It didn't happen."" 
 
Their success this year means Murray and Peers are already close to securing a place at the ATP World Tour Finals in London in November. 
 
Murray will now turn his attention to Friday's Davis Cup semi-final against Australia, where he is likely to partner Andy in the doubles as Britain bid to reach the final for the first time since 1978. 
 
""It's good, I don't have time to sit around and dwell on the past,"" Murray said. 
 
""I have to fly back tomorrow (Monday) night, get to Scotland and join up with the team and get back into the swing of things at Davis Cup. 
 
""There's a lot to look forward to next week. We have got a great chance to try to get to the final. We're playing at home as well so lots to look forward to.""",0f2f837c-bf29-4312-98c2-7fdb593228cf,News,2015-09-13T11:53:48Z,Bailiwick Express,Double woe for Jamie Murray after US Open final defeat,0.0,News

Here are five things to watch in Saturday's game between UCLA and UNLV.
1. Rosen, Part II
Understandably, there was a lot of buzz going into UCLA quarterback Josh Rosen’s debut last week. He was set to become the first true freshman quarterback to start an opener for the Bruins and represented the one significant unknown on one of the nation’s most talented rosters. And then, under the circumstances, he went out and turned in one of the best debuts any of us have ever seen. No hyperbole, he was that good. All eyes will be on Rosen against UNLV as he looks to show what he did against Virginia -- 28-of-35, 351 yards, 3 TDs -- wasn’t an aberration.
2. Replacing Eddie Vanderdoes
It flew under the radar a bit, but defensive lineman Eddie Vanderdoes’ season-ending knee injury last week was a huge blow to an inexperienced group of linemen. Contrary to what has been floating around on the Internet, UCLA coach Jim Mora said the injury did not occur while lifting teammate Kenny Clark after he scored a touchdown, but that doesn’t soften the blow. Vanderdoes was expected to be a key piece, next to Clark, and got off to a promising start with eight tackles against Virginia. It will be worth monitoring the play of Eli Ankou and Matt Dickerson, who will help fill the role vacated by Vanderdoes’ injury.
3. Coach vs. Coach
In 2004, UCLA coach Jim Mora and UNLV coach Tony Sanchez both got their first head-coaching gigs. For Mora, it was with the Atlanta Falcons. For Sanchez, it was at Cal High in San Ramon, California. While their paths to Saturday’s game are vastly different, Mora was very complimentary of Sanchez, who jumped directly from Bishop Gorman High to UNLV prior to this season. “I’ve gotten to go watch Tony coach a couple times and he does an outstanding job,” Mora said. “He (ran) a really professional environment there. Big-time program at Bishop Gorman. I read some of the news reports on his first game at UNLV and they were just glowing in terms of how they came prepared and handling things on the sideline. It doesn’t surprise me at all that that would be the case. I think sometimes we mischaracterize football coaches by what level they are at, whether high school, college or pro, good football coaches are good football coaches and Tony’s a good football coach.” UCLA did some prep work with Gorman film, but are mostly preparing for unscouted looks and what UNLV did last week against Northern Illinois.
4. Defense on offense
In the third quarter against Virginia, UCLA scored two touchdowns -- and both came from players better known for preventing them. Linebacker Myles Jack, who we’ve seen play running back at times over the past two seasons, got the first one, but Kenny Clark’s touchdown reception was a first for him. The Bruins’ willingness to use their best athletes wherever they can help the team is smart and part of what makes them such a fun team to watch.
5. So, Soso
Rosen’s debut got the attention, but the Bruins’ leading rusher last week also was a true freshman. Soso Jamabo ran for 79 yards on nine carries, eclipsing the work of Paul Perkins (59 yards, 14 carries) and fellow true freshman Bolu Olorunfunmi (30 yards, five carries). Jamabo’s performance, and Olorunfunmi’s to a lesser extent, helps confirm the assumption that the Bruins’ perceived recruiting success had made them a much deeper team. It will be interesting to see how Jamabo’s role evolves this week when running back Nate Starks returns from injury.",5c84cef4-bce1-417a-83fc-ffcbb3c02630,Blog,2015-09-11T00:11:10Z,ESPN.com - Pac-12 Blog,"Josh Rosen, UCLA try to match debut against UNLV",1.0,Blog

Sgt. Leanne Butler said a bridge patrol officer came in contact with the man after someone called to let them know he planned to jump off the bridge.

Butler said the man then slid into the driver's seat and began driving away. At that point, she said a second RCMP officer who approached the vehicle was struck and somehow got hooked on it when he became sandwiched between the bridge and the vehicle.

6306,"BANGKOK - Police claimed significant progress on Wednesday towards finding the mastermind of Thailand's deadliest attack after an arrested man admitted being near the Aug. 17 shrine blast and fingerprints tied him to the room of a suspected bomber. 
 
The unidentified man, arrested less than a kilometre from the Cambodian border on Tuesday, had told police he was not the bomber, but was in same area when a massive explosion killed 20 people. 
 
""It's natural that the suspect will deny he did it, but we still have to continue to look into that,"" deputy national police chief Chakthip Chaijinda told reporters. ""Right now the case has progressed about 70% already."" 
 
The latest suspect had stayed in the same Nong Chok area of Bangkok as another man arrested in a raid on Saturday that found stacks of fake passports, TNT, C4 and fertilizer. 
 
An arrest warrant was issued on Wednesday for a Turkish man who police believed was in his home country. He is married to a Thai woman currently in Turkey who was in contact with Thai authorities. 
 
She had rented a room in a second Bangkok building raided by police, where bomb-making materials were found. 
 
Police have received a torrent of criticism for leading a patchy probe and statements from top officials about possible perpetrators, motives and information extracted from suspects have been contradictory, speculative and often cryptic. 
 
Police spokesman Prawut Thawornsiri said the latest suspect's prints were found on explosives in the same room. 
 
""The man... may be the person who took the bomb out of the room or brought the bomb to the location of the incident,"" Prawut said on TV. 
 
Prawut also said biometric systems would now be used at immigration checkpoints to catch any suspects. 
 
The investigation has gained momentum since the weekend raids, before which the authorities had little more than a low-resolution surveillance camera video of a man in a yellow shirt leaving a rucksack at the popular Erawan Hindu shrine moments before the blast. 
 
With no claim of responsibility, speculation has centred on sympathizers of Uighur Muslims, opponents of the military government, southern ethnic Malay rebels and foreign extremists. 
 
Thailand's forced repatriation of 109 Uighurs to China in July caused international outrage and saw protesters smash windows and ransack parts of the Thai consulate in Istanbul. Many Uighurs transit through Southeast Asia to try to get to Turkey, which has a large diaspora. 
 
Though many details remain unknown, a connection with Turkey has been established. It is unclear if the two detained men are Turkish but police have been interrogating them though a Turkish translator and fake Turkish passports were seized in one raid. 
 
Turkey's embassy in Bangkok issued a statement expressing concern about ""speculative new reports"" on the nationalities of those arrested and said it had asked for clarification. 
 
Thailand's army chief and defence minister left for a three-day visit to China on Wednesday but said it was a scheduled trip unrelated to the investigation.",931050eb-56c5-4d04-ad0f-74c25ba7d94f,News,2015-09-02T15:05:17Z,St. Thomas Times-Journal,Bangkok bombing prime suspect admits being near shrine: Cops,0.0,Blog

7478,"TIP! You can never be sure who is interested when you offer something different. People can and do make their own decisions, but you still need to give them something to decide. 
 
After you’ve learned a little bit about the subject, network marketing becomes rather easy to understand. Follow the advice in this article to achieve your goals in multilevel marketing . 
 
TIP! Allow yourself time to spend with your friends and family in order to maintain important personal relationships, and to reduce stress levels. Businesses take a lot of time initially, just to build the foundations. 
 
Quality beats quantity in MLM. It is to your benefit to have individuals that are able to cultivate their own downline so that they are creating profits for the whole network. 
 Network Marketing  
TIP! Do as much research as possible about your particular product. You want customers to see how passionate you are about what you are selling. 
 
You should always try and visualize your success when you are dealing with network marketing. Yes, it may sound obvious, but MLM requires the ability to think ahead and envision a larger network. Positive creative visualization is an effective way to get you in the proper mindset for network marketing. 
 
TIP! Video marketing can be used to increase Internet traffic towards your network marketing websites. Videos give you the chance to present a content-rich marketing strategy very cheaply, all you have to do is host the video file. 
 
Instead of accepting failure, learn from your mistakes because it will allow you to keep inching forward. Analyze what you did wrong and take measures not to repeat these mistakes. Studying your failures will help you remove the methods that do not work, and you will be able to focus on the ones that do. 
 
TIP! When writing content for your network marketing website, ebooks or seminars, make sure to go outside of the box. Make sure your content is thorough and complete. 
 
Don’t let your business become all-consuming. Always make time to maintain your family relationships and other friendships. When you first start your business, you might have to devote more time to it, but as your business grows, your schedule should become more flexible so that you can balance your work-family time. 
 
Multi-level marketing success relies on your having a reliable email database. A large email list is essential, whether it is compiled yourself or purchased from a service. 
 
TIP! When you are considering a network marketing company, choose one that deals with products that you have an interest in. Your excitement for the product can be contagious, and as a result, your customers will find the product much more appealing. 
 
When aiming to have success in your particular network marketing tactics, you should aim to lead others. Use one-of-a-kind promotions to make your company stand out. A great approach can generate a wealth of traffic. Consider it flattering if your success leads competitors to try to copy you. Don’t copy someone else, try creating your own niche. 
 
TIP! Customers come first when it comes to network marketing. Your customers must be happy with your service, otherwise you won’t be able to stay in business. 
 
It is important to become thoroughly educated about your product. Being passionate about the product will show when you are marketing it to others. If people see that you are enthusiastic about the product, then they’ll be enthusiastic about selling it too. Being knowledgeable about a product also makes your own testimonials seem more sincere. 
 
TIP! Get customers to your website. This is definitely one of the most difficult parts of network marketing. 
 
Motivate your networking contacts so they dominate the conversation. Once you know a lot about them, whether it’s via social media or another medium, you will have a better idea of exactly what to do to best promote your products. When you understand their needs and desires, you can target them directly in your marketing strategy. 
 
TIP! One thing to consider in network marketing is neural-linguistic programming. Conversely, statements centering on the word “you” are important when trying to convince someone else of an idea. 
 
Get lasting results by focusing on the long term. Although your overall business plan may span several years into the horizon, you need to review the results of your MLM campaign at least quarterly. This will help you fine-tune your marketing to be on track for your bigger plan. 
 
TIP! You should hold regular team meetings. You can only successfully function as a team if you are working together towards a common goal. 
 
Create a monthly budget. Find out what you can afford to invest in your multilevel marketing business for it to continue running strong. Know that you cannot cut corners on your budgeting and still make a profit if you don’t invest in it from the start. 
 
TIP! One way to build your network marketing business is to read and share advice on internet forums. There are many network marketing forums which will offer great advice for your start-up. 
 
Continue using successful strategies and weed out the programs that aren’t working. Look for inspiration in your organization or industry. Try to adopt a similar approach and attitude, while following their success. Imitating these people will only help you along your way to the top. We can learn from our own mistakes, as well as from the success of others. 
 
TIP! When it comes to network marketing, you should always strive to learn from the knowledge and experience of others. Consider using a podcast because this is an excellent method of doing this. 
 
A company who specializing in outsourcing is something to consider to help you with multi-level marketing. This is an especially good option if you don’t have the time or workforce to handle these issues yourself. Farming out some responsibilities lets you focus on what’s important, leaving the outsourcing firm to do what they do best. 
 
TIP! You should take time to learn everything you can about your product. Your success relies on communicating enthusiasm for, and knowledge about, your product. 
 
The number one multilevel marketing tip is to always remember to treat it as a business. If you think you can work only two or three hours per week online, and then get rich quick, you will surely fail. Success comes only to those who are willing to put in the time and hard work required of a network marketer . Make yourself a promise that you will make the most effort everyday, and you will get on the road to success in multi-level marketing. 
 
TIP! Always make sure you have an appropriate answering machine message, as this may be the first time a client who contacts you, hears what you have to say. Make sure that your message is concise and positive. 
 
Before you begin a MLM campaign, you should decide what your budget is, and how tightly it should be stuck to. Make sure you have money for multi-level marketing, and some more traditional forms of advertising at first. A budget will force you to crunch some black and white numbers to get an overview of your expenditures. 
 
TIP! Network marketing should be handled as an integral part of your business rather than as something to merely dabble in. If you want to be successful, you will have to work hard to achieve your goals. 
 
In order to be as successful as you can be with MLM, you have to be open to new ideas. When you keep an open mind, you will be in a better position to conduct your business. 
 
TIP! Meetings shouldn’t pass the hour mark. When meetings go beyond one hour, it tells your prospective client that your business will require a great deal of their time and energy. 
 
Networking marketing is a business. One common pitfall is to treat network marketing lightly. MLM takes serious time and energy; with enough effort, you could make it your full time job. Research it and get the best training prior to starting! 
 
TIP! If you’re speaking with a lead for your network marketing venture, nod your head frequently, but refrain from shaking it. Your body tells a story of what you are thinking, and you want to give off a positive message. 
 
Stay connected to your network by regularly meeting with your team. You need to make sure everyone has a game-plan and are on the same page; you all need to stick together in order help each other reach your goals. It is very healthy for the entire team when you constantly meet with one another. 
 
TIP! Do not expect to see results right away. Many people are discouraged after too short a time.

5721,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department is providing new guidance designed to encourage federal prosecutors to bring criminal cases against corporate executives. 

Under policies issued Wednesday, corporations will be required to turn over evidence against individuals if they want credit for cooperation. The department is also directing its civil and criminal lawyers to work together in all corporate matters, and says corporate investigations will begin with a focus on individuals. 

Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates is expected to discuss the changes in a speech in New York on Thursday. 

The department in the last year and a half has reached multi-billion-dollar civil settlements against several banks and brought criminal charges against others.

664,"The mystery of the booming noise above Manchester appears to have been solved... after TV scientist Brian Cox confessed to a jet fighter joyride in the skies above. 
 
Hundreds of residents in Greater Manchester reported hearing a ‘loud, pulsating’ sound in the sky on Wednesday night - with theories ranging from lightening storms to UFO invasions. 
 
But physicist and broadcaster Brian Cox has provided perhaps the most plausible explanation after posting an online apology for making a racket at 30,000ft. 
 
This afternoon, the Manchester University professor Tweeted his 1.6m followers: “Thanks @BAESystemsAir for a hell of a ride last night, and apologies to the North West of England for noise.” 
 
Accompanying his post was a picture of the former D:Ream keyboardist wearing a pilot’s jumpsuit and posing beside a Eurofighter Typhooon. 
 
Thanks @BAESystemsAir for a hell of a ride last night, and apologies to the North West of England for the noise. pic.twitter.com/Pbm5GW34x9 
— Brian Cox (@ProfBrianCox) September 17, 2015  
Hundreds of people had reported hearing the sound, also described as a pulsating bass, with some stunned listeners saying the rhythmic pulsing seemed to ‘move’ too. 
 
It is not yet known whether the University of Manchester professor’s ride on the £70m aircraft which has a top speed of 1,320pm - twice the speed of sound - was for the filming of a new show. The defence manufacturer BAE has bases in Preston and Blackburn. 
 
But his revelation provides perhaps the most likely explanation for the phenomenon’s source. 
 
However, his apology hasn’t stopped dozens of people getting in touch with the M.E.N to offer their own explanations. 
 
Many people suggested that the noise could have being made by a Russian Antonov An-12 cargo plane which flew over Manchester at around 11pm. 
  RELATED:  
One, @sambop21, tweeted: “it was an Antonov plane out of Birmingham, which climbed over Manchester heading north. They’re very loud.” 
 
But others said they had heard the noise many times over the last few months and a vast amount of others came up with a few more fantastical conclusions as to what was responsible for the racket. 
 
Michael Wright, alongside a number of alien emojis, said: “It’s aliens bro! ALIENS!!!!!!” 
 
Kervin Becinal said: “It was United fans still crying from Luke Shaw’s injury. Get well soon lad!” 
 
While Joe Wood added: “My guess is, with it being Freshers week for a lot of students, all the music in the nightclubs synced for a short period of time, meaning that the pulse of the beat was amplified.”",c3ef9c74-5055-49bd-ba16-a84f9ff88deb,News,2015-09-17T17:04:56Z,Manchester Evening News,Mystery of Manchester noise revealed?

— tmaze_x (@TMAZE_SIMMS)      From behind the prison wall reporters heard shouts of encouragement from other prisoners for Horner’s protest, which is related to conditions in the category A prison.  
Prisoners were heard chanting “We shall not be moved” and “There’s only one Stuart Horner” the Manchester Evening News  reported . 
 
He was seen smashing skylight windows and damaged plastic corrugated roofing. At one point he was seen shimmying up a pole then dangling from it, despite later shouting that he was “afraid of heights”. 
 
Strangeways was the scene of major rioting in 1990. 
 
Horner was sentenced to 27 years in jail in 2012 at Manchester Crown Court for the murder of his uncle, Ian Taylor, who was 44. 
 
After 11 hours’ deliberation, a jury decided he shot Taylor in the chest with a sawn-off shotgun in June 2011, but Horner protested his innocence in court. 
   Speaking to an MEN reporter, Horner said the prison needed to “Get more fucking staff!”

7932,"“Today, you need to write a manifesto. A short statement of purpose that represents what you believe in. This needs to be a hill worth dying on, something not everyone will agree with (but hopefully some will). Ask yourself what’s wrong with the world? And then address the problem. Pick a fight with it, and invite others to join your cause.” (I might have waited and saved my declaration from yesterday to use today, but I haven’t exactly been looking ahead at these prompts, so here we are. I’ll have to keep it a bit more grand scheme, since fighting sex trafficking is one of my most specific, most prioritized cause.) It’s so easy to talk about what I believe. I’m good with words; I’m able to inspire others based on the written or spoken word and I always have a lot to say. As much as I love words, I’ve found in recent years that they fall terribly short when it comes to matters of life, of death and of the heart. But still, here we are and now is my chance–a chance to verbalize what I believe to be true and how I want to live my life. Well, you asked. I believe that if I believe something, whatever it may be, then everyone I encounter better be able to discern it with minimal verbal convincing on my part. They say talk is cheap, and it’s one of my favorite cliches because it is one of the truest ones yet. If I say that I love Jesus, you should be able to tell by how I act and how I live that I love Jesus. If I say that I believe that all people are created in God’s image, then there should be love flowing off of me onto those around me, not just in word, but in deed and attitude. If I believe that there’s more to life than having my hair look good and having a nice car, then you better know from watching me that I’m holding on to something deeper. If I believe that all people are equal, regardless of gender or skin color, than I better spend my days bringing that reality to the world around me, not just by what I do say, but also in what I don’t say. If I believe that singleness isn’t a curse and that I don’t need a man to complete me, then I better not be feverishly working to snag a dude to validate me every waking moment of my life. If I say I believe that Jesus has my best interests in mind, then I can’t give up hope when things seem dark from time to time and allow the fear take hold of me. It’s easy to spout off beliefs and manifestos. It’s encouraged these days. Everyone everywhere is ready to share their thoughts, and I’m right there with them. I’m as opinionated as they day is long and I feel things fierce and unadulterated passion that my head gets away from me and so does my mouth. But no matter how eloquent I am at sharing my beliefs, if you can’t see them in me being lived out in the day to day, I believe I’ve lost my right to speak about them to you. And you can call me on it. And that’s something I believe with all my heart.

2742,"Japanese brand confirms new sports car concept set for Tokyo motor show debut 
      September 30 2015 - 12:43PM  Andrew MacLean      Mazda RX-7 Concept teaser  Photo: Supplied  
The iconic Mazda RX-7 will be born again in November. 

The Japanese car maker has confirmed it will showcase a new-age sports car concept at the Tokyo motor show in November, heralding the likely return of the unique rotary engine. 

In a brief statement issued today, Mazda has announced the new - and yet to be named - sportscar concept will make its world premiere at the Tokyo show, but has given little else in terms of technical details. 

""The design of the sports car concept... is modern but maintains a sense of lineage and authenticity, appearing almost to condense Mazda's entire history of sportscar development into a single model,"" it claimed in the statement, providing the strongest indication the new-age RX-7 will draw on the success of its rotary-powered predecessors. 

Another hint is that - among the 14 models on display on its show stand - an original Cosmo Sport will be there to ""compliment a heritage display showing Mazda's history of convention-defying engineering."" The Cosmo Sport was the company's first rotary-powered two-door sports car. 

The brand also issued a dark-tinted teaser image that showcases the outline of the two-door body, which features a classic long-bonnet, swooping roofline and short hatchback in its proportions. 

It is expected that the new-age RX-7 will borrow its rear-drive underpinnings from the latest MX-5 roadster, and that its rotary engine could feature a hybrid assistance system to ensure it meets emission regulations and offers the performance characteristics necessary for a sports car.",98c21189-abff-4997-a41b-8f78d4e55eb9,News,2015-09-30T03:08:28Z,Drive.com.au,Mazda to reveal new RX-7,0.0,News
1705,"It’s funny – you would think we spent the entire summer in our backyard, but we actually avoided the deck and grass at all costs through the months of June, July, August, and most of September.  It was TOO HOT.  But now that it’s cooling off, we’re actually getting back outside as a family.  Hoorah! 
 

 
Speaking of being outside… 
 

 
I made Candy Cane Lane iced tea this weekend, and it was THE BOMB. 
 
  
 
Anyway… We did a major backyard renovation when we moved into our home three and a half years ago.  But here are the best part of our backyard! 
 
  
 
The Hammock 
 
  
 
The Husband gave me this hammock for my birthday (I think for #30?  Not sure – the years have started to blend together!).  I love laying in it and looking up at the trees.  It’s also a pretty good kiddo toy.  Hah. 
 

 
The Large Deck 
 
  
 
Our original deck was super small .  The design was so poor – for a decent-sized backyard, a little rectangle where you could hardly fit a few chairs just didn’t make sense. 
 

 
The first time my mom saw the house, she said, “You should expand this deck out so it touches the top of the hill.”  Kristien and I were like… “You’re a GENIUS!” So that’s exactly what we did.  I love how much room there is now for eating, lounging and playing. 
 

 
Our Sun Sails are pretty cool, too – they were only $20 each at Costco and create so much shade.  
 
  
 
The Sand Box 
 
  
 
In the back corner of the yard is our sandbox, which I got on Craiglist for $30 for Henry’s 1st birthday.  It is BY FAR his most loved and used toy.  I love the sandbox because he’ll head outside to the backyard and entertain himself forever – I love that it’s open-ended play. 
 

 
The Geodome Climber 
 
  
 
SO EXCITED about this addition!  I originally saw this product featured on a post by Janet Lansbury about Outdoor Play Spaces and knew I immediately had to buy it. I have been LUSTING for a swing set (things that parents say…) but decided that a geodome climber was much more cost and space efficient.  
 

 
We get an incredible amount of use out of this thing (BFF Nicole and I even climbed on it the other night!) and it’s so fun to watch Henry learn to navigate it.  I can tell that it will be used for many years by both kids.  And get this… it was only $200 or so! 
 

 
Things I Want to Add to the Backyard… 
 
  
 
A Mud Kitchen 
 
Rock climber grips along the side of the fence so Henry can climb along the side 
 
A tire swing 
 
  
 
A kiddie-sized picnic table

1381,"George Zimmer, the grizzled founder of Men's Wearhouse, has launched a new business with an old idea: Renting tuxedos. 
 
The startup is called Generation Tux. Zimmer is already familiar with the business of renting tuxedos, since that's an integral part of Men's Wearhouse, which he created more than 40 years ago and was forced out of in 2013. 

Generation Tux charges $150 or less. Unlike more traditional tux rentals, where customers visit for fittings, customers of Generation Tux can ""build"" their tux online and get free delivery. 

Zimmer launched another company last year called zTailors, which serves as an online marketplace for tailors. 

""I'm doing my best to create a second act,"" the gravelly-voiced Zimmer told CNNMoney this summer, when zTailors went nationwide. But in a recent interview with The New York Times, Zimmer said he was having trouble getting the business off the ground. 

Zimmer hopes that Generation Tux will give zTailors a lift, and vice versa. 

""Generation Tux is different from any other tuxedo and suit rental platform today as the only service to provide access to the zTailors network of expert tailors,"" he said in a press release. 

Zimmer became famous for his Men's Wearhouse commercials, with the catch-phrase, ""You'll like the way you look, I guarantee it."" He no longer uses that slogan for his new businesses. 

Men's Wearhouse experienced a leadership blow-out two years ago when the board of directors fired Zimmer. They opposed his plan to sell the company to an investment group because it would have forced the company ""to take on a huge amount of debt."" The board also claimed that Zimmer refused to work with executives ""unless they acquiesced to his demands."" 

Zimmer wrote an open letter complaining about his ""growing concerns with board decisions,"" but his 4% stake in the business wasn't big enough for him to get his way.",00306cca-42d8-43e8-b221-feabab026db0,News,2015-09-15T16:21:02Z,WYFF4.com,'I guarantee it' Zimmer launches another startup: Generation Tux,0.0,News

4795,"Well, I guess this is a thing now…people running for president musing about whether they might reintroduce the torture techniques Obama “prohibited” when he took office. The latest is Jeb Bush; three years ago, it was candidate Romney. The fact that torture is framed by these candidates as a policy choice, and the possibility that one of them might in fact reintroduce it, is one of Obama’s chief legacies. He chose not to prosecute torture as a crime, instead banning it (or some of it, anyway) via executive order. As I’ve said before: Obama has no more power to prohibit torture than Bush had to permit it. Torture is illegal in America. The law, not the president, is what prohibits torture. What would you make of it if the president said, “That is why I prohibited murder. That is why I prohibited rape. That is why I prohibited embezzlement, and mail fraud, and tax evasion…” In America, the president doesn’t make the law, nor does he rescind it. The president executes the law—which is why Article 2 of the Constitution is called “The Executive Branch.” Presidents who make and rescind laws at will are more commonly known as kings. Remember: what one president by fiat prohibits, another at his or her pleasure can permit. Anyone who cheers Obama’s torture “ban” is missing the insidious, long-term effect of that ban…and could probably use a refresher course on civics, too. Torture: de jure illegal; de facto policy.

2504,"“Don’t take this class if you believe the Bible is inspired or infallible.” 
 
When I started taking classes a year ago as an entering doctoral student here at UC Berkeley, I knew I was entering a very liberal environment. I had heard that the campus was the flagship of liberal academia, and I was also familiar with other bastions of liberalism during my time in the Ivy League and at Oxbridge as an undergraduate and a master’s student, respectively. But despite UC Berkeley’s ultra-liberal reputation, I took it as a given that there was still significant latitude for free thought and expression in the classroom. 
 
Thus, I was not expecting the unapologetically heavy-handed double standard I encountered from the professor, a well-respected biblical scholar. His initial cutting remark within five minutes of the start of class was soon followed by more: “This stuff isn’t taught in synagogues or churches because they don’t want to piss people off. … Anyone can take this class, as long as you play by the rules of the game. … If you disagree with the approach we use, that’s an F.” 
 
I was shocked — not only by his contempt for religion but also by the fact that he wasn’t even trying to be subtle about his narrow-minded academic approach. Apparently, free thought and academic curiosity were off limits from the get-go. “I don’t want people who are going to disagree with me all semester,” the professor declared in no uncertain terms. 
 
To be fair, part of me understood where my professor was likely coming from. After all, as Thomas Kuhn writes in his classic book “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,” prevailing paradigms within any disciplinary study (including the study of the Bible) demand adherence to certain assumptions or ground rules that allow the field to advance within that paradigm. Thus I understood that my professor probably wanted to operate within a historical-critical framework of studying the Old Testament without having to deal with students questioning the fundamental basis of that approach to literary criticism. 
 
Kuhn, however, also points out that paradigms are often flawed. 
 
So, undeterred, I politely peppered my professor with questions to try to better understand his intellectual paradigm. Just to be clear, there is a correct answer you want us to accept, I asked. “Correct.” What about rigorous biblical scholarship claiming, for instance, that Moses did, in fact, write the vast majority of the Pentateuch? “That doesn’t exist.” It does, I argued. “I don’t want people who are going to disagree with me all semester,” he repeated. I thought a university was an environment in which multiple viewpoints and debates were encouraged, I countered. “Not in this classroom” came the maddeningly smug response. 
 
After the class, I was left shaking my head, a mixture of indignation, sadness, confusion and frustration exploding inside me. As I packed up my things, other students came over to me and thanked me for my questions, explaining that they, too, were upset about the professor’s overly harsh attitude toward religion and religious students. We all felt the arrogance of the professor and the injustice of the situation, but did not know what to do about it. 
 
As I have continued to process the encounter over the past year, I have realized that the attitude and ultimatum of my professor troubled me for two major reasons. 
 
First, I was deeply troubled by the hypocrisy of a famously “liberal” school employing such a closed-minded professor. In fact, the professor’s actions ran directly counter to the stated diversity values of the University of California. According to the UCnet website , “Diversity is a defining feature of the University of California and we embrace it as a source of strength. Our differences — of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, socioeconomic status, abilities, experience and more — enhance our ability to achieve the university’s core missions of public service, teaching and research. We welcome faculty, staff and students from all backgrounds and want everyone at UC to feel respected and valued.” Not only did the professor make no effort to value students with academic and religious perspectives differing from his own, but he actively persecuted us, essentially forcing us to drop his class or suffer. 
 
Second, the fact that religious persecution was flaunted so unabashedly by a well-established professor in front of an entire classroom of students — at the premier public university in the world, no less — speaks to a teaching culture that, at best, tacitly acquiesces to his attitude and, at worst, actively encourages it. This was certainly not the first class this professor has taught, nor is he the only professor to openly criticize religion in a UC Berkeley classroom, nor is UC Berkeley the only campus where this type of persecution is a problem. A number of my friends, at UC Berkeley and other universities, have experienced similarly hypocritical discrimination based on their unpopular religious or scholarly perspectives, thanks to a certain “liberal” fundamentalism as narrow-minded as any conservative, religious fundamentalist. Such a deep-seated posture of indifference toward the religious and academic freedom of students — in general, but particularly for those of strong religious faith, who are often the minority — is shameful and outrageous. Everyone deserves a seat at the table. 
 
As Kuhn points out, recourse to criteria outside existing paradigms is essential when two schools of thought are in competition with each other. After all, what better place to explore the intricacies and nuances of competing academic paradigms than the modern university? The permission to explore, think and argue is invaluable in both advancing scholarship and protecting religious freedom. As such, the “liberal” double standard — by which all views and scholarship is permissible and encouraged, except those deemed too traditional, passe or otherwise unpalatable for the sophisticated 21st century thinker — is simply unacceptable at the modern pluralistic university.

8818,"He has been coach of the New York Giants since 2004 and has two Super Bowl rings to show for it, but only this summer did Tom Coughlin gain an entirely different perspective on the NFL.
One from 50 feet overhead.
In a whirring reminder that technology marches on, the Giants used a three-pound drone to hover during a mini-camp and shoot an overhead view of practice. The team's video crew practiced with the device for three weeks before flying the DJI Phantom 3 over the players and coaches.
Coughlin, 69, who began his coaching career in a world filled with flattops, not laptops, wasn't ready to make a judgment when asked about the usefulness of the drone. See the most-read stories in Sports this hour Open link ""It is another advancement,"" he said. ""The way it was presented to me is, 'Is this angle worth looking at?' I am not really ready even to say that because I only saw it one day and saw it in a certain drill. Maybe there are drills where it would help, looking right straight down on an inside play.... There may be something to it. I'm not ready to say one way or another. I wouldn't want to stand in the way of the advancement of technology.""
People all over the league are taking a wait-and-see approach to a host of cutting-edge technologies that the league, individual teams and sometimes individual players are giving a try.
From enhanced TV-camera coverage, to virtual-reality simulators, to officials experimenting with tablets for replay reviews as opposed to ducking under a hood, to equipment aimed at enhancing health and safety, the NFL is constantly evolving and testing the next new thing. ""For the NFL, we want to embrace technology and initiatives in any way that can really affect our entire ecosystem,"" said Vishal Shah, the league's vice president of media strategy and business development. ""That's from the players and their health and safety, to the coaches in training of the players, to the fan experiences.""
Even the way some players get from Point A to Point B at training camp has changed. Increasingly popular are two-wheeled electric scooters that look like sideways skateboards — think a Segway without a handle — that allow players to zip around at an impressive clip.
""They can get going pretty fast,"" said Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Ryan Shazier, effortlessly whipping a pirouette on the board as he spoke. ""The thing is, when you're going you don't want to bump into something because they'll slip out from under you.""
Talk about future shock. Minnesota running back Adrian Peterson posted a selfie-style video online of him riding one of those boards around the inside of his home while wearing just shorts and flip-flops. Everything is going smoothly until he hits an unseen object and laughingly falls forward off the device, narrowly avoiding a hard spill. Breathe, Vikings, breathe ...
Technology is about trial and error. With that in mind, ESPN and CBS will experiment this season with Pylon Cam, a custom-molded pylon on the goal line that houses multiple cameras to give viewers new angles of that critical part of the field.
The system was unveiled by ESPN in January during the College Football Playoff Championship, but it has evolved significantly since then. It has advanced from eight two-camera pylons with lower-quality wireless cameras, to four four-camera pylons — two bracketing each goal line — featuring better cameras that are wired but have breakaway connections if the pylons are knocked down. cComments Got something to say? Start the conversation and be the first to comment. Add a comment 0 ""They're not a live camera, they're meant as a first or second look,"" said ESPN's Jay Rothman, ""Monday Night Football"" producer. ""We had it in the preseason right away in the first series in Tampa. We used them in our second game and Jameis Winston went for the pylon for the touchdown.
""To help give that definitive look, certainly in a scoring situation — again, the goal line or end zone sideline as well as the sideline from the pylon looking down, foot in, foot out, two feet in, completion of the catch, that sort of thing. So I think they're going to be extremely helpful in critical situations when you're looking at the four corners of the end zone and at the goal line.""
Some NFL players are seeing the game in a different way, too, while wearing virtual-reality headsets instead of helmets. STRIVR, a company founded this year by former Stanford football players Derek Belch and Trent Edwards, captures 360-degree, real-spherical video that allows the user to see through the headset just what a player would see. The system shows real players, not Madden-style depictions. Belch, the company's chief executive and a former Stanford kicker, began the project last year as his master's thesis, working with Jeremy Bailenson, a Stanford professor and founding director of the school's virtual human interaction lab. Edwards, a former NFL quarterback, is now vice president of product and business development. Co-founder Bailenson is listed as the company's chief visionary.
Belch said that already six NFL teams are using the system — Dallas, Minnesota, Arizona, New Orleans, San Francisco and the New York Jets — along with seven college teams, the NHL's Washington Capitals, NBA's Washington Wizards, and WNBA's Washington Mystics.
The football version is not a decision-making tool or a video game, but another way of watching film. The company is also developing its product for training on-field officials.
""You're never in a game until you're in a game,"" Edwards said. ""The way the position is played, this is as close to being in a game as possible. When you put the headset on and watch the content, you can feel your heart rate going up. It doesn't feel like you're in a meeting room.""
Players are always looking for an edge, whether overt or subtle. Companies that produce helmets and pads are perpetually striving to develop products that are safer, lighter, more durable. Glove companies constantly look for ways to make it easier to throw and catch a ball.
Santa Ana-based Alignmed makes a snug-fitting ""posture shirt"" aimed at properly positioning the shoulders of the wearer, thereby reducing fatigue. The shirt is designed for athletes in all types of sports, and other companies have competing products. According to an Alignmed spokesman, the company has multiple NFL players as clients, among them quarterbacks Peyton and Eli Manning.
The NFL, in the midst of a five-year, $400-million deal to use Microsoft tablets, positioned those devices even more in the spotlight during Week 2 of this summer's exhibition season. On-field officials in four games used Surface Pro 3 tablets to review replays as opposed to ducking under the hood to get a second look at what cameras captured.
Even high-definition replay is insufficient when it comes to gathering the type of in-depth statistics the NFL is seeking. The league is using player-tracking technology called Next Gen Stats to answer questions such as: How many miles per hour is a particular player running? How open was that receiver? How many extra yards did that running back travel in his serpentine path to the end zone? This season, every pair of NFL shoulder pads will be fitted with two radio-frequency chips that are roughly similar to a GPS device and allow the league to track when a player is on the field, how far he travels and how quickly.
""We're creating a baseline this season,"" said Steve Byrd, chief commercial officer for Sportradar, a sports data service that will crunch the NFL's raw numbers and transform them into statistics that are meaningful to teams and fans.
""It's going to be a couple years before we use this as common language of the sport. We don't just want to know what happened on the field, but how it happened. It's exciting."" cComments Got something to say? Start the conversation and be the first to comment. Add a comment 0 As for Coughlin, he's open to the ways technology could help, but his feet are firmly planted in the nose-to-the-grindstone tradition of coaching. No drone or tablet or bundle of statistics can replace hard work.
He's the coach of the Giants, after all, not the New York Jetsons.

Here are a few to consider, depending on your expertise: Freelance writing Accounting services Legal consultation Business consulting IT management Marketing services Beyond the services you’ll offer, your expenses to start a service business should be relatively low. Heck, you can start one with just a laptop and nothing else! As you grow, though, invest in your marketing efforts to attract more business. Hobby to Business If you’ve dabbled in something you’re passionate about as a hobby, whether that be sewing or dog walking, consider building a business around it.

Where: Mustang Stadium, 906 S. Heights Dr., Mustang 
 
TV: KSBI-52 (Cox 7) 
 
Records: Edmond Memorial 1-1; Mustang 2-0 
 
Last week:  Edmond Memorial 27, Edmond North 14 — Memorial quarterback Grant Decker was big with two touchdown runs and 127 rushing yards to go along with his one TD pass as Memorial dominated its city rival. 
 
Mustang 41, Stillwater 14 — Mustang posted 447 yards of total offense — including 291 passing from Wyoming commitment Chandler Garrett — to avoid a second straight year of being upset by Stillwater 
 
Players to watch: Edmond Memorial — Zeke Mammen , LB. Mammen recently verbally committed to Emporia State. He’ll be tasked with anchoring a solid Bulldogs defense that has its hands full trying to slow down Mustang’s juggernaut offense. 
 
Mustang — Blake Williams , TE. Williams is off to an incredible start to the season. Against Stillwater, he caught all three TD passes from Garrett and he caught a big one in the opener against rival Yukon. At this point, teams have to find a way to slow down Williams, perhaps with some extra coverage. 
 
Storylines: Edmond Memorial — The Bulldogs struggled in Week 1 to slow down Southmoore’s potent offense. By all accounts, Mustang’s offense is even more prolific. If they can pressure Garrett and force some mistakes, that could change things. 
 
Mustang — Slow down Decker. He’s elusive in the pocket and is capable of creating something from nothing. Southmoore had success by countering his elusiveness by blanketing his receivers while scrambling, which forced multiple mistakes.

4210,"A member of a carnival committee in Cambridgeshire quit after he said he was banned from dressing as a clown to promote the event - and his clown mascot idea was panned. 

Michael Bates, of Kent Road, Huntingdon was a member of the town's carnival committee - formed this year to revive the carnival which had not taken place for more than a decade because of political in-fighting. 

He created a clown style character called Charlie Carnival to be used to plug the event and to raise funds. 

But the idea was ditched, Mr Bates claims. 
  
He said: ""In my absence at a meeting the character was deemed to be unsuited for promotional purposes as they have a carnival queen. The carnival queen is brilliant and is a great asset, but I would have thought that having clowns giving out sweets would have given the carnival a real lift. 

""The committee said they thought that it was a brilliant idea why then did those in charge not adopt Charlie Carnival."" 

Mr Bates has made a formal complaint to Huntingdon Town Council over the affair. 

He said: ""This is not some guy throwing his toys out of the pram the fact is that the carnival committee has lost other committee members because of similar or related issues. In fact the last two meetings have been cancelled because of low numbers. 

""Charlie Carnival exists as a real person and as a digital character as well. Charlie has a Facebook page and is available to any event who would like to use him. He makes no charge for his services and will in fact create funds as there is related merchandise that is for sale. 

""I understand that the reason the carnival committee banned Charlie was one of costs but actually there would have been no costs whatsoever as Charlie already exists and in fact the reverse is true as charlie was developed to create funding opportunities."" 

Mayor of Huntingdon, Cllr Bill Hensley, offered earlier this year to act as a peace broke r to ensure the town's carnival goes ahead next year after organisers were forced to cancel this year's even t. 

At a meeting at Huntingdon Town Hall Cllr Hensley formed the Huntington Carnival Committee in order to revive the town's carnival, which has not taken place for 13 years. 

He told the News he was not aware of Mr Bates' clown idea but said that as chairman of the committee, they would have to take into consideration people with full-blown phobia of clowns, or coulrophobia, which is relatively rare although others do recoil at the sight of clowns. 

Cllr Hensley said: ""Sorry but I don't know anything about a clown idea for the carnival. We would have to consider that an awful lot of people have a phobia of clowns."" 

A public meeting was held on July 30 at Huntingdon Town Hall and Cllr Hensley says he has the support of several local companies and organisations. 

This year's carnival, which was due to take place on August 22, was cancelled amid political wrangles and splits in the town council.",d7b386aa-9020-40e9-9215-182be255cb8d,News,2015-09-25T04:42:00Z,Cambridge News,Cambridge News commented Boo-hoo: Clown's tears as he claims he's banned from Cambridgeshi...,0.0,News

2374,"By Minggu Simon Lhasa 
BANGKOK, Sept 1 (Bernama) -- Thai security authorities arrested a foreigner suspected of being involved in the bomb attacks in Bangkok last week in a province close to the Thai-Cambodia border. 

Prime Minister General Prayuth Chan-ocha, said the male suspect was arrested this morning in Thai territory, indicating that the country has achieved a lot of progress in the case since the arrest of the first suspect on Saturday. 

""I have been informed about the suspect's arrest during lunch time. He was arrested in Parai village in Sakeaw province,"" he announced in a media briefing this afternoon. 

He described the man as an important suspect. Sakaew province is located in the eastern part of Thailand and about three hours' drive from Bangkok. 

While the Thai authority is reluctant to name the suspect or his nationality, the social media already provided the information. 

According to the info in social media, Twitter, LINE chat application and Facebook, the latest suspect who was arrested today is a 25-year-old Chinese national who came from Xinjiang, the home province of Muslim Uighur ethnic group. 

He is charged with exiting Thailand without permission. 

Meanwhile, Thai police spokesman Police Lieutenant General Prawuth Thavornsiri said the suspect is believed to be in the same group of the first suspect arrested last Saturday that was responsible for the bomb attacks in Bangkok. 

The suspect was detained and was under questioning at a military camp, Prawuth said. 

He said witnesses were also asked to identify and confirm the suspect, and DNA from the suspect will be compared with the DNA found in the rented rooms that were raided by the authorities a few days ago in the districts of Minburi and Nong Chok, both in Bangkok. 

So far, the Thai court has issued warrants of arrest for seven suspects in connection with the two bomb attacks in Bangkok, one at the Erawan shrine at Ratchaprasong intersection in central Bangkok and another at Sathorn pier at the Chao Phraya river. 

The Minburi Court today issued warrants of arrest against three foreign male suspects, but the police refused to reveal their nationalities. 

Yesterday, the same court issued two warrants of arrest for a Thai Muslim woman, 26-year-old Wanna Suansan, who is believed to be in Turkey at the moment and an unidentified man. 

The Royal Thai Police chief, Police General Somyot Pumpanmuang said Wanna who is considered as a suspect has contacted the authority and wanted to return to Thailand to clear her name. 

However, there is still no date yet of her return, he added. 

In the same case last week, two warrants of arrest were issued against the bomber at the Erawan shrine, identified only as the man in a yellow shirt and just a police sketch, and an unidentified man in relation to the bomb attack at Sathorn pier.

4450,"COLUMBUS, Ohio -- The College Football Playoff race will start to take shape in week three, especially in the SEC, where there are some questions about just how good the SEC West really is. 
 
If Alabama loses to Ole Miss, it could be the first step toward the SEC missing the playoff, something I predicted at the start of the season with my playoff picks.  Step one almost happened last week with Auburn barely escaping Jacksonville State in overtime. 
 
This week, No. 15 Ole Miss is a touchdown underdog at No. 2 Alabama and No. 18 Auburn is a touchdown underdog at No. 13 LSU. Either could win, and either could start a chain that ends with an SEC filled with two-loss teams, with none of them in the top four. 
 
That would be as bad for the SEC as Ari's record was last week.  
 
Here's what  happened a week ago with our picks: 
 
• Doug  17-4  
 
• Reader Boniface Womber  16-5 
 
• Reader Martin Plush 15-6 
 
• Reader Rob Milota  14-7 
 
• Bill  14-7 
 
• Ari  11-10 
 
Teams 
 
In our team standings, Boniface and I dominated at 33-9, Bill and Rob went 28-14 and Ari dragged down Martin as Team Ari went 26-16. Here are the team standings for the year. 
 
• Team Doug  59-19 
 
• Team Bill  58-20 
 
• Team Ari  54-24 
 
Readers vs. Us 
 
Ari just killed us against the readers, and there was nothing Bill and I could do. We went 42-21 while the readers were 45-18 to take the lead on us for the year. 
 
• Readers  87-30 
 
• Cleveland.com  84-33 
 
And now on to this week's picks, where our Auburn-LSU and Ole Miss-Alabama picks were split 3-3. 
 
Joining the first-place Team Doug is reader David Anderson, a Shaker Heights native who now lives in New York. He can be found on Twitter  @Danderso13 . 
 
Drafted for Team Bill is Silas Hansen of Muncie, Ind. He's on Twitter  @silas_hansen . 
 
Attempting to prop up Team Ari is LaMarques Greenwood of Shaker Heights, who enjoys debating hip-hop with Ari. He can be found on Twitter @Marques_G . Good luck LaMarques.

5368,"The snack aisle at your local supermarket may look a lot healthier in five years. (Ben Schumin) Perhaps the introduction of the so-called healthier, more adult-focused Thin Oreos earlier this year was a sign that Mondelez, the maker behind the cookies and a plethora of other snacks, was on the fast track to being a health-conscious brand. The company vowed today to revamp its offering so that in five years 50% of its revenue comes from healthy snacks. Executive vice president and chief growth officer Mark Clouse says in the release that the company currently records just one-third of its sales from healthy snacks. “We intend to become the global leader in well-being snacks,” he says in a statement. “Our goal is to simplify and enhance the ingredient and nutritional profile of our base business while also focusing on breakthrough innovation to address consumers’ well-being needs.” To achieve the new health-focused goal, Clouse says the company will dedicate 70% of new product development efforts on “well-being platforms.” Those efforts will likely include more individually wrapped snacks that are 200 calories or less and products that have nutritional attributes, such as fewer ingredients and no artificial flavors, Reuters reports. “If you look at where consumers are going, we have to better position the portfolio to fully unlock the potential for growth,” Clouse said. In addition to turning toward more healthy fare, Mondelez reaffirmed on Thursday its commitment to increasing revenue of organic products by 3% this year.

Lauren McCauley | Common Dreams | Reader Supported News | September 9, 2015

mong the litany of risks posed by the continued extraction and use of fossil fuels, an Associated Press analysis published Tuesday exposes yet another harmful side effect of the oil and gas drilling boom: an uptick in toxic wastewater spills.
According to data obtained from leading oil- and gas-producing states, “more than 175 million gallons of wastewater spilled from 2009 to 2014 in incidents involving ruptured pipes, overflowing storage tanks and other mishaps or even deliberate dumping,” Associated Press reports, tainting agricultural land, poisoning drinking water and sparking the mass die-off of plant and animal life.
Most of the incidents involved the spill of fracking wastewater, which is a combination of underground brine mixed with a slurry of undisclosed chemicals. As the story notes, “A big reason why there are so many spills is the sheer volume of wastewater” produced, which according an organization of state groundwater agencies, amounts to roughly 10 barrels for every barrel of oil or more than 840 billion gallons a year.

1585,"Interactive: explore the 7-Eleven investigation Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has apologised after confusing a fast food operator with 7-Eleven, the convenience store chain rocked by allegations of exploitation and a wage fraud cover-up.

Is it lunchtime yet? Might grab a sub 

In a slip of the tongue, Mr Shorten said Australians had been ""appalled and disgusted by the scenes at Subway"" while speaking at a media engagement in Sydney on Wednesday.

Mr Shorten had wanted to use the exploitation of workers on visas by 7-Eleven to highlight Labor's concerns about aspects of the China free trade deal but instead named the sandwich chain.

""We've all been appalled and disgusted by the scenes at Subway where literally thousands of people on visas are being ripped off,"" he said.

The blunder was quickly picked up by commentators and Mr Shorten posted an apology on Twitter.

""Apologies to @SubwayAustralia, I meant to say @7ElevenAus. Is it lunchtime yet? Might grab a sub.""

A joint Fairfax Media and Four Corners investigation revealed massive underpayment of 7-Eleven workers, many of whom are students on visas earning as little as $10 an hour.

Labor has been under pressure to agree to a free trade deal the government has struck with China but is holding out because of concerns about foreign workers being brought in on projects worth more than $150 million without having to conduct labour market testing.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said this will not be the case and former prime minister Bob Hawke, former foreign minister Bob Carr and former Labor leader and minister Simon Crean have urged the Opposition to support the deal. 

""We want to ensure that we don't see people coming here on visas being exploited and undercutting Australian jobs,"" Mr Shorten said on Wednesday.

In a separate statement, Mr Shorten corrected his earlier mistake and said the government should be doing more for 7-Eleven workers.

""What's been reported to be happening at 7-Eleven stores is just appalling,"" he said.

""If workers are being ripped off like this the authorities should be urgently investigating.

""Why is the government so quick to pile in on its political opponents but missing in action when workers are being exploited.

""If this brings more attention to the plight of these workers, then I welcome that.""

4760,"We are super excited to announce that Blockspring have just released an integration with us to let you automatically pull data from the web into a spreadsheet. They’ve created an awesome solution that lets you use a range of great APIs using only a spreadsheet. Their Excel and Google Sheets plugin enables you to bring data into your spreadsheet, run text-analysis and much more. 

So today we want to show you how you can use live web data from a spreadsheet to do a bunch of cool things in just a few minutes. Currently Blockspring is using our Magic API , which automatically generates a table of data from a URL. You just have to provide the Blockspring integration a URL and it pulls the data from that site into a nice, orderly table - all without leaving your spreadsheet. 

  
Pulling live data into a spreadsheet 
In this example we’ll use Magic and Blockspring to pull in data from Ikea’s rugs . 
What you’ll need: 
Free Blockspring account 

Free Import.io account 

Your Import.io API Key 

A Google spreadsheet with the Blockspring Add-on installed (You can also use Excel) 

A URL you want to pull data from (or you can use our example) 
Step 1: Set-up the spreadsheet 
Open a Google spreadsheet and sign into Blockspring, which is found under Add-ons. 
  
  
Step 2: Choose Import.io 
Once you’re logged in, the Blockspring console will open on the right. Scroll down until you find Import.io. 
  
The first time you do this, you’ll need to put in your Import.io API Key (which you can find on your account page ). 

  
Step 3: Extract data from a URL 
Click on “Extract Data from URL” and then click “Insert into selected cell”. Blockspring will insert this formula into that cell: =BLOCKSPRING(""extract-data-from-url-importio"", ""url"", "" http://www.ikea.com/us/en/search/?query=chair "") 
  
And you should see data on Ikea chairs brought straight from the website into the sheet! 

  
Step 4: Change the URL 
The URL Blockspring inserts is just a placeholder. To change it, simply replace it with whatever URL you want and hit Enter. 
  
You can also change the URL in the formula to be a cell reference to make it easier to change the URL. 

  
Manipulating your data 
Live data in Google Sheets is pretty exciting, but where the Blockspring integration gets really cool, is how you can use the data you’ve pulled in with other API integrations. Here are three quick examples to get your wheels turning. 

  
  Get Product Color Trends 
Let’s say you’re in product development and you want to know what the hot colors of the season are. 

If we take the Ikea data set we created earlier, we can apply the Blockspring Color integration to pull out the primary color from each image. Everyday you could have a fresh data output of all the products on the website and colors for each product. 

See the full step by step here 

  
  Compare Product Prices Across Sites 
Whether you’re doing competitor pricing analysis or just a little comparison shopping, it’s helpful to know which sites have the best prices. 

Using the Import.io integration with the Amazon Products integration, you can pull in the Ikea products and look them up on Amazon and pull in the corresponding prices. Voila! Simple price comparison, all without leaving your workbook. 

See the full step by step here 

  
  Identify Core Company Team 
Before you approach a new company – whether you’re selling something, asking for a job, offering a partnership, etc – it’s a good idea to know who the major players are. 

Using the Import.io and Bing integrations, you can easily pull in the core team from a company’s Crunchbase page. The Bing integration will allow you to search for a company’s page and the Import.io integration will take that URL and extract all the relevant information from it. 

See the full step by step here 



What will you create? 
We’d love to know what other uses you can find for Import.io in Blockspring. Tell us about them in the comments or on Twitter ( @importio  @blockspring ).",4194e5c4-fcee-415c-8887-6df6ee7426a0,Blog,2015-09-03T17:47:37Z,import.io blog,How to get live web data into a spreadsheet without ever leaving Google Sheets,1.0,Blog

1497,"In a telling example of police incompetence, a poor woman has been repeatedly subject to cops raiding her house in a futile attempt to arrest her dead husband. In 1996, James Jordan Sr. was arrested for jumping a turnstile in New York’s subway. A decade would pass without police pursuing him and in 2006, Jordan would succumb to his diabetes and died at the age of 46. It wasn’t until he died that officers began looking for this turnstile-jumping hardened criminal, and they did so by harassing his widow. In 2014 alone, cops would tear apart the apartment of Karen Fennell four times as they searched for her dead husband who was wanted on a misdemeanor charge almost two decades old.The repeated raids had gotten so out of hand that Fennell was forced to hang her dead husband’s death certificate and funeral flyer on the front door. But still, police came into her home and turned furniture upside down looking for this deceased man. “I wanted it to be the first thing they saw before they came into my home and flipped it upside down,” Fennell told The Post of her morbid posting. “I can’t hide anyone in my apartment. It’s not big enough for that. But they keep coming and insisting that he’s in my house.” After being harassed by countless teams of incompetent NYPD cops Fennell hired an attorney and filed a lawsuit. Last week, Fennell had enough stress of reliving her husband’s death and settled with the city for $10,000. While Fennell’s case may seem like a fluke, the fact is that police raid the homes of innocent people in attempts to locate suspects who do not live there, all the time. Not only do they raid the wrong house, but in some instances they even kill the innocent occupants.  Perhaps the saddest aspect of Fennell’s story is that this settlement will likely have little if any effect on the NYPD. They may very well show up at her house tomorrow.

5681,"The first European research framework programme was launched in 1984, with just over €3 billion (US$3.3 billion). Over 30 years, Europe has pooled more and more resources into a tool that has proven its worth many times, helping to structure and reinforce European collaborative research in an increasingly competitive environment. 
The principles of added value and coordination have driven Europeans to invest in the development of a true 'European Research Area', dedicating nearly €80 billion to the Horizon 2020 programme in 2014. The gradual expansion of the programme was also a response to a greater awareness of the fact that Europe was starting to lag behind international competitors as regards long-term research and development spending. 

The critical upscaling of the programme at that time was, in the words of Máire Geoghegan-Quinn , former European commissioner for research, innovation and science, “a vote of confidence in the power of research and innovation” to support the EU to achieve its goals in terms of jobs and growth. The European Commission’s Joint Research Centre has estimated that each Euro invested in the 6th  and 7th  framework programmes generated about 13 Euros in increased value added in the business sector. 

Two years into the implementation of Horizon 2020, as the European Commission and stakeholders such as the European University Association, or EUA, get ready for the mid-term review, indicators continue to point to a highly successful flagship instrument. 

The success rate for applications in 2014 is 14%, suggesting intense competition – down from 20% during the 7th Framework Programme – despite the large increase in funding. Universities make up the first group of applicants and beneficiaries, using Horizon 2020 funds to undertake ground-breaking research and unlock Europe’s innovation potential. 

Disinvesting in the HE sector 

Policy-makers have recognised the central role of research and innovation in fuelling economic growth and societal well-being, both at European and at national level. Nevertheless, Europe’s universities have been operating in increasingly difficult financial conditions over the last years and have often faced significant budget cuts which also affect their research mission. 

The EUA has monitored trends in public funding to the sector since 2008 and has reported alarming trends, with many countries not reinvesting anywhere near enough in higher education and research after severe cut-backs. Also worrying for future prospects is the recent tendency to withdraw funds from the sector in countries that traditionally fared well in European comparisons, such as Denmark or Finland. 

To maintain their research activities, cash-strapped universities look towards European funding to mitigate some of the impact of lower national public funding. 

The  constant battle for Horizon 2020 

But budget cuts in research at a national level have also had an echo at the European level, and soon after the difficult birth of Horizon 2020, negotiations resumed on the framework for its annual budget. The new programme has been under constant attack and it has taken the research community’s relentless efforts to preserve this unique instrument. 

It is particularly important because the EU framework programmes have a strong capacity to set trends at national level, despite their relatively small size. Cutting funding for research at a European level will not encourage governments to invest further in the sector. 

The most iconic and recent battle has been that of the European Fund for Strategic Investments or EFSI, launched by the commission this year. Aimed at strengthening Europe’s capacities and long-term growth and competitiveness, the fund has similar objectives to those of Horizon 2020, but is conceived as a leverage tool based on loans. 

While EFSI and Horizon 2020 should be seen as complementary, the financial model proposed by the commission to support EFSI partly rested on shifting resources away from Horizon 2020. 

The EUA reacted strongly to the proposal and supported the European Parliament in its efforts to protect Horizon 2020 throughout the decision-making process. Just before the summer break, the package was adopted with lesser cuts to Horizon 2020 resources. Fundamental research, under the programme’s pillar I, was eventually spared from the cuts, and half a billion Euros were restored to the other parts of the programme. Still, collaborative research took a grave hit during this process. 

The narrative around EFSI has also been a misleading one, promoting the fund as a viable option for universities and almost considering EFSI and Horizon 2020 as interchangeable. But there is one clear difference: funds have been withdrawn from a grant-based programme to be redeployed to a loan-based financial instrument. 

Financing through debt is not what the university sector needs. In times of constrained resources, the temptation is indeed getting stronger, both at European and national level, to turn to financial instruments that are supposed to create leverage. But the EUA warns against this worrisome trend which risks universities’ long-term financial sustainability. 

Current challenge 

Today, the battle is once more a very concrete one. The EU’s Council and Parliament are negotiating next year’s budget and Horizon 2020 is – yet again – a bone of contention. Despite commitments made in the aftermath of the EFSI deal, funding for Horizon 2020 is at stake and so are payments to beneficiaries of the programme. 

In particular, it is clear that such a large-scale flagship programme cannot rely on residual budget margins to maintain the level of activities it has so far supported. It needs reliable funding rather than constant attacks from parties that fail to connect finances to the wider policy objective of smart and sustainable growth for Europe. 

The EUA has expressed its position on and support for Horizon 2020 to the European Parliament on this matter, and called on it to work towards a solution that preserves an instrument that is vital for Europe’s future. Research is at the root of many of the goals that the European Union has set for itself; committing proper funding to it is the next logical step. 

Thomas Estermann and Enora Bennetot Pruvot are respectively director and deputy director for governance, funding and public policy development at the European University Association, or EUA. The EUA’s work in these areas aims at developing and advocating common policies for European and national policy-makers to provide the conditions and frameworks to establish strong, autonomous, well-funded and financially sustainable universities.",90f20ab2-05d3-4ae3-8d66-f49d6c3ddb24,News,2015-09-27T07:45:33Z,University World News,The constant battle for Horizon 2020,0.0,Blog

6222,"ATLANTA (CBS46) - 

After an outbreak of vehicle break-ins early Tuesday morning, police are investigating another rash of thefts at an apartment complex in Buckhead. Officers believe the same suspects have hit dozens of cars nearly every day this week.

Nearly 100 vehicles have been hit in less than a week, most in what are supposed to be secure apartment complexes.

The latest round of burglaries happened at the Berkeley Heights apartment complex on Northside Drive during the early morning hours on Wednesday.

""I seen on the news where a bunch of kids were breaking in,"" said victim Jeremy Simmons. ""I just didn't think it would happen to me. I've been here five years.""

Police say as many as 14 vehicles have been broken into. One of the vehicles belongs to a Fulton County Marshal Cadet and a training pistol was taken during the burglaries. CBS46 has confirmed with the Marshal's office the weapon was disarmed and not functional. It had the training barrel and magazine with it. The Marshal's office says that Cadet is not in trouble. The Cadet class will go through a second retraining.

Police have no suspects in custody.

One victim gives this advice to the people causing all this damage.

""Just reach out for some help,"" Simmons said. ""There are people out here that will help you. You don't have to take other peoples things.""

This comes after several vehicles were broken into at multiple locations in Buckhead early Tuesday morning.

One condo development alone had 31 vehicles broken into. Police said burglaries were reported at six to seven locations in the city.

Many apartment complexes in the area have been forced to hire security officers to patrol parking lots 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Former Fulton County prosecutor Ash Joshi points to a growing number of experienced criminals, repeat offenders, who are often let out of jail and back onto the streets by the justice system.

""Every judge in Fulton County will have enough murders, sex crimes, armed robberies and shootings to last 3 times the 30 weeks they already have,"" said Joshi.

Police continue to remind people to not leave valuable things in sight. They say take things like computers, cell phones and purses with you when your vehicle and don't forget to put your GPS devices away.

The recent rash of break-ins have led Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed to ask county judges to take property crimes more seriously.

If you have any information on any of these crimes, you're urged to contact Atlanta Police.

1892,"The Niners this morning announced they have waived 10 players and, as expected, the Australian superstar is not among them.

It means Hayne, who is firming as a starter in the punt return position, needs only to get through one more cut this Sunday (AEST).

The 49ers roster currently stands at 75 and must be trimmed to 53 by 1p.m. on Saturday here in California.

Hayne jersey available ‘off the rack’

Jarryd Hayne merchandise is being sold ‘off the rack’ in the San Francisco 49ers team store — six days before the NFL team is even announced. Source: DailyTelegraph 

The Daily Telegraph this morning purchased a Hayne #38 jersey — for the bargain price of US$99.95 before tax — from the club’s main retail outlet at Levi’s Stadium.

Until now, the only way fans could buy a Hayne jersey was to go online, or into stores, and have one specifically made to order.

HAYNE HUB: MORE JARRYD HAYNE NEWS 

Indeed, only last week it was suggested neither Nike or the 49ers would put Hayne merchandise ‘on the rack’ until the 27-year-old superstar had made the 53-man roster.

Yet so staggering is the desire for gear bearing the name of the Australian cult figure, the 49ers have this week taken the extraordinary step of putting a range in their stores prior to the final pre-season game against San Diego.

Indeed, in the few minutes it took us to take pictures of the #38 jersey on sale, a staffer came and grabbed two off the rack to put on hold behind the counter.

Asked about the demand, she said: “Oh, this guy sure is hot. Source: Supplied “Every time I pick up the phone people are saying ‘Have you got Hayne, have you got Hayne?’.

“It’s crazy.”

Online, the 49ers price for a customised Hayne jersey remains US$99.95. However to have one made here at Levi’s Stadium costs US$149.95.

However, with interest in the Aussie now teetering on chaotic, and the franchise playing San Diego at home Thursday, club officials have decided to try and help meet the demand.

A store manager said he was unable to say exactly how many Hayne jerseys had been made available in-store or whether more would be produced prior to the Chargers game.

However, The Daily Telegraph understands the current batch were only put out over the weekend, when the team was playing the Denver Broncos at Mile High Stadium.

Certainly, the decision to sit Hayne’s jersey beside that of Kaepernick — in the official team store, no less — is staggering when you consider the Sydneysider is yet to be guaranteed a contract. Source: Supplied Currently, the traditional red and white home jerseys are the only ones for sale at Levi’s Stadium. However, should Hayne make the cut Nike are ready to mass produce a variety of jerseys with his name and number.

They will also consider other ‘accessories’ such as caps and T-shirts.

The find comes only a day after 49ers coach Jim Tomsula said he had already “seen what I need to see” in terms of Hayne as a punt returner.",c19d0d6c-5949-4275-ab2d-e01ce1529833,News,2015-09-01T00:47:00Z,NEWS.com.au,Hayne hits the shelves after surviving first cut,0.0,Blog

5504,"Lee missed a short putt for a birdie on the 17th of their resumed fourball match and then picked up her ball under the assumption Europe had conceded - Hull was already walking toward the last hole - only for Pettersen to claim Europe hadn't conceded the short putt. The umpire intervened and Europe was awarded the hole. 
 
""I missed it but I had just under two feet, like a foot and a half left coming back. And I looked at it and I thought I heard it was good,"" Lee said. ""To me it looked good.

I didn't even think twice about it. So I just picked it up."" 
 
Lincicome said Hull and Pettersen were both heading to the last hole. ""So maybe that's why Alison thought she heard them say it was good, because their backs were almost to us and they were kind of walking away. And then she just picked it up because she thought she heard someone say it was good. And they both said, 'No, we didn't say it was good.' I don't know if it was somebody in the crowd that said it,"" Lincicome said. ""The putt was a foot. They had given us putts farther than that all day. And Alison just thought she heard it was good."" 
 
Referee Dan Maselli said there was nothing he could do to allow Lee to ""put that ball back down and putt."" ""It would have to be something that was uttered by the team, a caddy, one of the helpers, one of the assistant captains, or the captain, other than that. But nothing was said by anybody,"" Maselli told NBC's Golf Channel. 
 
Lee and Lincicome had been 1 up after 15 holes before England's Hull made a birdie on the 16th to draw the Europeans level. Hull's birdie on the 18th sealed Europe's second win from the fourballs and leaves the Americans at a huge disadvantage before the 12 singles matches. 
 
""It's just B.S. as far as I'm concerned,"" U.S. captain Juli Inkster told NBC. ""Everything was going great. I thought it was a great week for women's golf and to put a damper on that . I mean, there's no way they could ever justify that. I don't care what you say, you just don't do that to your peers."" 
 
The 20-year-old Lee, the only rookie on either team, and the 19-year-old Hull were both in tears after the match. Europe captain Carin Koch said the ball went too far to concede. ""We all feel bad for Alison. She made a mistake and it's very unfortunate. We don't want things like that to happen. She made a mistake in the rules of golf. We had a rules meeting and we clearly stated that you have to concede a putt very clearly and she didn't go with the rule,"" Koch said. ""The rules are the rules. You have to follow the rules."" 
 
Earlier Sunday morning in the resumed fourballs, Americans Stacey Lewis and Gerina Piller held onto their lead to defeat Caroline Masson and Caroline Hedwall 1 up, while Karine Icher of France and Catriona Matthew of Scotland finished with three consecutive birdies to beat Brittany Lang and Lizette Salas 2 and 1. 
 
Europe was leading 8-5 on Saturday before the three fourball matches were suspended due to bad light. Europe needs 14 points to win a third straight Solheim Cup for the first time. The U.S. needs 14½ to extend its series lead to 9-5. 
 
In the singles, it was Carlota Ciganda of Spain vs. Lexi Thompson; Matthew vs. Morgan Pressel; Icher vs. Lincicome; England's Melissa Reid vs. Lang; Gwladys Nocera of France vs. Lee; Caroline Masson of Germany vs. Piller; Anna Nordqvist of Sweden vs. Lewis; Azahara Munoz of Spain vs. Salas; Norway's Pettersen vs. Angela Stanford; Hull vs. Cristie Kerr; Hedwall vs. Michelle Wie; and Sandra Gal of Germany vs. Paula Creamer.

717,"– /PressAdvantage/ – Nature’s Hangout, a business in Cedar Crest, NY, has announced that their best selling hammock straps are once again in stock. At initial launch in August, the company had not anticipated just how popular the straps were going to be, and they quickly sold out. The stock has been replenished to make sure everyone would be able to get the hammock straps.

Nature’s Hangout’s Mark Haden says: “Our new hammock straps were more popular than we originally expected. Only 5 weeks after our initial launch of the product, we sold out! We scrambled with our manufacturer to get more made, but still were out of stock for several days.”

It took just one week after its release for the straps to become a bestselling item. The product remains very popular, and numerous requests for more stock came in during the few days that none were available. The company is now committed to being able to keep up with demand now that they have a better understanding of how popular the straps actually are.

One of the main reasons why these straps have become so popular is because they are tree-friendly. An increasing number of parks where campers go to have outlawed hammocks that use traditional straps, ropes or screws. This is because those straps are able to cause significant damage to a tree and its bark. The hammock straps from Nature’s Hangout, by contrast, have been designed to protect the tree, even with repeated use.

Another thing that has been much appreciated is the ease of use of the straps. “Straps came quickly, they were just what was stated in description,” says one customer. “My 15 yr old took them out, unwrapped and set up his hammock without asking a single question…easy!!”

The straps also come in an easy to carry bag. This enables people to take the straps with them wherever they go, be that on a camping trip or a day out at the beach. Additionally, since the straps have been designed for prolonged use, some people simply use them to attach a hammock in their garden and leave it there.

3906,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A U.S.-EU commercial data-sharing deal faces a major test on Wednesday when an adviser to the European Union's top court will say whether he believes it is still binding in light of allegations of mass U.S. spying. 

The case stems from a complaint filed by 27-year-old Austrian law student Max Schrems against Facebook with the Irish data protection commissioner, who monitors compliance with privacy laws. 

Schrems argued the company helped the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) harvest email and other private data from European citizens by forwarding data to servers in the United States and asked the Irish watchdog to investigate whether the United States was providing adequate data protection. 

The Irish regulator rejected the request on the grounds that it was bound by the EU Safe Harbour agreement of 2000 which allows companies to transfer EU citizens' data to the United States because it is held to have sufficient privacy safeguards in place. 

The Irish watchdog plays a central role because Facebook users in the EU enter an agreement with Facebook Ireland when they join the social network. 

Schrems, who still uses Facebook and says he wants to improve it, appealed the decision in October 2013. Irish High Court Justice Gerard Hogan subsequently asked the European Court of Justice (ECJ) if the Irish regulator was still bound to follow the Safe Harbour decision given ""gaping holes in contemporary U.S. data protection practice"" and whether it could or should conduct its own investigation in light of allegations of mass U.S. surveillance programmes. 

Safe Harbour, which simplifies the everyday business of some 4,000 companies, came under fire in 2013 after fugitive ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked details of a U.S. mass electronic surveillance programme, known as Prism. 

The leaks showed the NSA used major web companies, including Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft, to gather user data. 

Following the fallout the European Commission called for a review of the agreement and negotiations with Washington have been going on since January 2014. 

Wednesday's opinion to judges, who are expected to rule in a few months' time, comes at a delicate time for the renegotiation of Safe Harbour. 

""It could have an impact on the whole Safe Harbour system as a transfer solution,"" said Tanguy Van Overstraeten, a partner specialising in data protection at law firm Linklaters. 

ECJ Advocate General Yves Bot will deliver his opinion in Luxembourg on Wednesday at around 0930 CET (0730 GMT). While the court's judges are not bound by the opinion, they follow it in most cases. 

""If the judges come to the situation where Safe Harbour is not valid then it could be reopening the whole story and that, for many thousands of U.S. companies, would be very difficult because that could mean that in fact the basis of the transfer of data by them would be invalid,"" Van Overstraeten said. 

Facebook declined comment.

FUTURE Australia batsman Chris Lynn has been confirmed as the new skipper of the Queensland Bulls.

Lynn will take on the captaincy for the three-week Matador BBQs one-day Cup tournament following the selection of Bulls captain Usman Khawaja to tour Bangladesh with Australia’s Test team at the same time.

News Corp revealed the Lynn captaincy news last week and how the 25-year-old is set to be the new Brisbane Heat captain in the Big Bash.

The Bulls will also welcome three debutants for the domestic one-day tournament next month.

Towering fast bowler Billy Stanlake, English-born batsman Charlie Hemphrey and South African-born Marnus Labuschagne have all been included in a Queensland Bulls one-day side for the first time.

Both Hemphrey, who scored a century for the Bulls in the last Sheffield Shield match last season, and Labuschagne made their first class debuts for Queensland in 2014-15.

Labuschagne, 21, played five Sheffield Shield games last season and has come from outside the Bulls squad after impressing during recent pre-season practice games where he scored two half centuries in three games.

The 204cm Stanlake, 20, is yet to represent Queensland at senior level but was an Australian Under-19 squad member for two seasons and attended the National Cricket Centre last year as a national performance squad scholar.

6241,"California is often considered the nation's trendsetter. But Republicans running for president better hope that's not true. 

Their talk about immigration echoes what Californians heard back in the 1990s. That's when Proposition 187, a ballot measure viewed as strongly anti-immigrant, was a key to the re-election of California's Republican Gov. Pete Wilson. 

Anyone who was in California in 1994 remembers the infamous campaign commercial for Wilson's re-election. ""They keep coming,"" intoned the narrator over grainy black and white video of people dashing into traffic, as they cross the border from Mexico. ""Two million illegal immigrants in California,"" he says over ominous music. 

Then Wilson appears on screen saying, ""I'm working to deny state services to illegal immigrants. Enough is enough."" 

Wilson was linking himself to Proposition 187, a ballot measure to deny public services, including health care and education, to undocumented immigrants. It won overwhelmingly and Wilson did too. But 187 was thrown out by the courts. 

And over the past two decades, Republican registration in California has plummeted. It's now just 28 percent. 

Political Scientist David Damore traces the party's decline to the 187 campaign. 

""The moment when the Latino population is about ready to explode in California and have an impact on politics, the Republicans were pushing a very, very hostile agenda,"" said Damore. ""The end result is, it's no longer a competitive state."" Damore is a senior analyst for Latino Decisions, a research and polling organization. He co-authored a study called the ""Prop 187 Effect."" One of those effects is the increase in voter registration and turnout among California Latinos. 

Damore said his research also found that ""folks who were not naturalized citizens, they increasingly became citizens so they could participate in the political process."" 

Now all California statewide offices — from governor to insurance commissioner — are held by Democrats. Democrats also have overwhelming majorities in both houses of the state legislature and in California's congressional delegation. 

Nationally, the Republican Party is aware of the California example. Their own postmortem of the 2012 presidential election, said ""If Hispanics think that we do not want them here, they will close their ears to our policies."" It also called for comprehensive immigration reform. 

That was then. Donald Trump is now. 

Undocumented immigrants are ""bringing drugs,"" said Trump when he announced he was running for president. ""They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."" 

Now, Republican presidential hopefuls are increasingly taking up the issue of unauthorized immigration. For example, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has called for the elimination of ""sanctuary cities,"" that is, cities that limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities. Other GOP candidates — like Trump — support building a wall on the border with Mexico. Some have joined Trump in questioning the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship. 

""Trump's entrance into race made it so that they had to discuss it whether they wanted to or not,"" said Republican political consultant, Reed Galen. 

He worked on the presidential campaigns of George W. Bush and John McCain. He thinks it's possible that the current harsh rhetoric on immigration could alienate Latino voters around the country, the way that Proposition 187 alienated them in California back in the '90s. 

""Latinos, who at [that] time might have been with the Republicans on any number of issues, be it the economy or social issues, thought, well, if this is something you're going to be for, then you probably don't like me."" 

That shifting attitude can now be seen on the national level too, said Latino Decisions analyst David Damore. 

""George Bush in 2004 wins 39, 40 percent of the Latino vote,"" after supporting comprehensive immigration reform, said Damore. But just eight years later ""Mitt Romney's in the low 20s,"" after saying that undocumented immigrants should ""self-deport."" 

""So there's a big swing in a relatively short amount of time there."" 

Republican consultant Reed Galen doesn't like the trend. 

""As a Republican who has to go win elections, I would like more people to like our candidates than less,"" he said, laughing. ""That's sort of a baseline."" 

But with Donald Trump leading in the polls, it's undeniable that the talk about undocumented immigrants has struck a chord with part of the Republican base, said Galen. 

""Do I believe that it has the ability to derail the party?"" he asks. ""Absolutely. Is it a long-term concern? Absolutely."" 

But in the short term it's hard to get candidates to think about anything but winning the nomination.",32e4d574-2105-4a37-9ea0-a82feb916941,News,2015-09-15T15:42:00Z,NHPR,"From California, A Warning To Republicans On Anti-Immigration Rhetoric",0.0,Blog
8867,"This piece was initially published on Storybench, a cookbook for digital storytelling. Storybench is a collaboration between Northeastern University’s Media Innovation program, a new graduate degree in digital journalism, and Esquire magazine. “Hillary Rodham Clinton was fortunate to come of age just as the modern feminist movement was beginning to expand opportunities for women in the workplace—and in politics.”

This is how Bloomberg News introduced a recent interactive timeline that shows Hillary Clinton’s political career measured against the rise of the modern feminist movement. Christopher Cannon , a senior designer with Bloomberg’s graphics team spoke with Storybench ‘s Aleszu Bajak about how they sourced, designed and built the timeline. Jeremy Scott Diamond, a developer and designer with Bloomberg graphics, provided Storybench with some of the code he used to build the timeline.

Timelines aren’t always the best option, says Cannon, but “if you can show multiple narratives and how they     with one another, explicitly or implicitly showing correlations or causations, you might have a great timeline on your hands.”  
The best way to honor women who broke boundaries before us: Keeping it up. See the timeline: http://t.co/lB63pCTE8v 
— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) August 18, 2015 
 How was the story pitched? The idea for this timeline came from MaryAnn Busso and Yvette Romero , two journalists on Bloomberg’s graphics team. They wanted to show how events in Hillary Clinton’s life and career intersected with key events in the modern feminist movement, all the way to her status as Democratic front-runner in the 2016 presidential race. One of our editors, Laurie Meisler , guided us throughout the process, keeping the research focused on data to show Clinton’s life and career relative to data on women in politics and business. The timeline starts in 1964, the year Clinton was a senior in high school and first became politically active.  Where did you find the data and sources? Data for the three fixed charts at the top mainly came from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Census, and the Center for American Women and Politics (CAWP). Finding data on the number of women in Congress and the pay scale between genders was fairly straightforward; finding data on women in professional occupations required a bit more digging around as records on professional women did not always exist. The data and information that populates the main columns of the timeline came from a wide variety of sources including the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, The Center for American Women and Politics, and Carl Bernstein’s bio on Hillary’s life, “A Woman in Charge.” We even reached out to Mattel for information on their 1985 business executive Barbie doll. Whenever information from online or printed sources seemed unclear or incomplete (which was often), MaryAnn and Yvette made plenty of phone calls for clarification. Could you explain your process developing the timeline? All of the data and information was entered into a spreadsheet which, when printed out, became quite long. An early sketch of a horizontal timeline came out of an Excel printout which clearly separates the content into two rows (Hillary’s life and the women’s movement) and distinguishes between numerical facts, milestones, and quotations. I started working on the design with the intention that any recurring data points for which we had yearly information (number of women in Congress, the pay-scale gap, and number of women in professional occupations) should be illustrated as small charts placed in a fixed position in the top bar and should update as the user scrolls down through time. The top bar is strictly data while the main part is what one normally associates with timelines: photos, captions, and pull quotes. With this design format in place, a user could, for example, scroll down to 2009 and read about the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, then glance above it to see that women were still only paid 77¢ for every dollar that men earned (six years later, they now earn 78¢). We also wanted to juxtapose interesting facts between the two columns, such as Hillary’s age (32) when she became a mother in 1980 as compared to the median age of first-time mothers (23) in the same year.  
The timeline at various stages of development. Credit: Christopher Cannon. 
  How was the timeline built? Our interaction designer/prototyper Jeremy Diamond started building the timeline in HTML, JavaScript, and D3 further refining the design and interactions in the process. To ease the updating of the timeline’s content, he set up a CSV file that JavaScript reads which has multiple fields for both Hillary’s timeline and the women’s movement timeline, and could be designated as either photos or pull quotes. New photo additions had to follow a specific naming convention to appear in the proper place within the timeline. Adding, editing, and deleting photos became a frequent but easy task to perform.  
A screenshot of the original spreadsheet. Credit: Christopher Cannon. Link to CSV of data here. 
  How did you put it all in the CMS? Our team has several templates in GitHub , some for graphics that are embedded in news articles, others for stand-alone interactives like this timeline. Jeremy created a new GitHub repository and made the working timeline, and I edited the CSS to further refine the styling and update the images and text, committing any changes to the repo. Ed note: Bloomberg developer/designer Jeremy Scott Diamond shared this snippet of code which builds the HTML by pulling from a CSV using D3. Diamond credits Mike Bostock’s queue for loading data, Gregor Aisch’s d3-jetpack for added functionality, and Adam Pearce’s graphScroll for triggering events.  Any interesting challenges? What didn’t work and what’s on your wish list to fix? From a design or execution point of view, this was fairly quick and straightforward. The challenge lies in the content: finding it, explaining it in a concise manner, and telling a cohesive story. Keeping this graphic focused and cutting any text, data or images that didn’t support the greater narrative was the difficult part. We wanted a timeline that actually made sense and had purpose being presented as a timeline. 
The content needed to be on-topic, balanced, and non-partisan and not read as an endorsement of Hillary’s candidacy. Even more challenging was finding good photos from the exact year a person or event is mentioned (hats off to the Bloomberg photo department for tracking down some of these images!). Some great photos never made it into the final graphic because they were either from the wrong year, were outside the scope of this timeline, or we just couldn’t obtain the rights to them. What should students and newsrooms keep in mind when building this kind of a timeline project, especially on deadline? Be clear on the scope of the story and its content, and narrow it down early on . Otherwise it could quickly become a massive and sprawling mess. Also ask yourself whether a timeline is the best way to tell the story. Most timelines are simply a series of dates and pictures, devoid of context or meaning. If you can show multiple narratives and how they intersect with one another, explicitly or implicitly showing correlations or causations, you might have a great timeline on your hands.

4944,"Now here’s something we don’t see in Canada every day - a diesel-powered compact car from a domestic car company. 
 

                            And it’s one that is actually edging the performance numbers and fuel efficiency ratings of the German competitors who have always dominated the automotive diesel niche. 
 

                            The Chevrolet Cruze 2.0TD diesel model was added to the lineup last year as yet another step in the multi-pronged GM approach to fuel efficiency.  
 

                            GM engineers from Torino, Italy, and Russelheim, Germany, worked in conjunction with colleagues in Pontiac, Michigan to adapt a proven powertrain already used in Europe, where 40 per cent of all Cruze models sold feature diesel engine power.  
 

                            The resulting Clean Turbo Diesel for North America is a 2.0-litre turbocharged unit that makes 151 hp at 4,000 rpm and 264 lb/ft of torque peaking at 2,600 rpm.  
 

                            The prodigious amount of torque in particular - at least 250 lb/ft peaking early between 1,750 and 3,000 rpm with short bursts of overboost power at nearly 280 lb/ft - makes for a strong, linear acceleration feel and 0-100 km/h times of 8.7 seconds.  
 

                            This engine is also B20 rated, meaning it will take a mix of 20 per cent bio diesel mixed with 80 per cent normal diesel fuel. 
 

                            GM claims the 8.7/5.1L/100km (city/hwy) fuel economy rating (with emphasis on the highway numbers) makes the Cruze 2.0TD the most efficient non-hydrid car in Canada, edging out the Golf, Jetta and Beetle models in VW’s TDI lineup.  
 

                            Of course, before anyone starts crowing about beating the best German imports, we should acknowledge that the Cruze diesel engine itself is actually built in Kaiserslautern, Germany. 
 

                            The Euro-sourced engine is mounted in an American-built body that has undergone updates for 2015. 
 

                            An exterior facelift adds styling cues that have trickled down from the critically-acclaimed Impala and Malibu, mainly a new dual-port front fascia design and LED daytime running lamps that complement the Cruze’s swept-back headlight assemblies. 
 

                            Inside, all 2015 Cruze models continue to boast quality interior treatments, tweaked this year with revised cupholders, a trunk release switch moved to the centre console, and door lock switches that have moved from the console to the front doors.  
 

                            The Cruze’s suite of available technologies has also been bolstered with connectivity upgrades like Text Message Alerts, Apple Siri integration and a new OnStar 4G LTE system with a Wi-Fi hotspot. 
 

                            The Cruze lineup starts with a very basic 1LS ($16,075) model powered by a 138 hp 1.8-litre four-cylinder with no air conditioning, a manual six-speed and 16-inch steel wheels with disc/drum braking. It does, however, start with 10 airbags, ABS braking, Stabilitrak, tilt/telescoping steering, power windows, remote keyless entry and six-speaker audio. 
 

                            The lineup builds on that foundation as you move up the trim level ladder to 2LS ($18,775), 1LT ($20,040), Eco ($21,740), 2LT ($22,140), 2.0TD ($25,295) and LTZ ($27,195). 
 

                            If we follow that progression of pricing, the 2.0TD diesel seems to take a significant jump in cost but it should be noted that the price includes a standard six-speed automatic, normally a $1,450 - $1,675 option. 
 

                            GM execs figure the diesel engine actually adds about $1,500 but it’s hard to pin down because of the 2.0TD’s apples-and-oranges mix of equipment, blending the upscale, leather appointed amenities of LT and LTZ models with the fuel-efficient technologies of the Eco model including a special Aero Package with grille shutters, rear spoiler and body kit, low resistance rolling tires on special 17-inch alloy wheels and a tire inflator kit instead of compact spare. 
 

                            Unique add-ons for the diesel include a 17-litre diesel exhaust fluid tank, remote vehicle start and specially adapted MDK Hydra-Matic six-speed automatic tranny. 
 

                            Is the diesel worth it? Well, I hate to fudge the answer, but that depends. 
 

                            The strength, simplicity and durability of a diesel always appeals to high-mileage commuters. There’s a bit of the usual clatter on cold startup but, at cruising speeds, the diesel engine is muted, as civilized as it is strong. 
 

                            The 8.7/5.1L/100km (city/hwy) rating may be the lowest of the lineup but a gasoline-powered ECOTEC 1.4-litre turbo offered with the LT, LTZ and Eco models makes the same horsepower, less torque but with fuel econ numbers close to the diesel rating. 
 

                            My real world results after a mixed bag of driving conditions with the 2.0TD diesel worked out to a still excellent 6.8L/100km (comb). Those numbers would translate into an 850 km plus range on a tank of gas. 
 

                            You might also save on less expensive diesel fuel, about a dime cheaper per litre during my test period, but I have seen diesel bounce up and down on either side of the regular gas price over the last few years, so that’s a bit of a crapshoot. There’s also always the caveat of fewer diesel gas pumps and, usually, dirtier diesel gas pumps. 
 

                            And I’ll add one more complication to the decision process - a brand new, larger, lighter, tech-loaded and more fuel-efficient 2016 Cruze that will go on sale early next year, followed a year later by a brand new 2017 diesel version. 
 

                            Ah, yes. Decisions, decisions. 
 

                            There’s no shortage of choices in the Chevrolet’s best-selling Cruze lineup, both now and in the future, but, for 2015, the 2.0TD model offers strong, thrifty performance and civilized upscale amenities blended into a handsome package with all the usual hallmarks of award-winning diesel dependability. 
 
WHAT’S BEST: The Chevrolet Cruze 2.0TD (diesel) is claimed to be the most fuel-efficient non-hybrid car on the road today. 
 WHAT’S WORST: The diesel engine should be available at lower price/trim levels. 
 
 WHAT’S INTERESTING: Even after a recent 2015 makeover, a brand new lighter, larger and more technically enhanced 2016 Cruze is set to debut next year with a 2017 Cruze diesel model slated to follow a year later.

2904,"Hedge funds are so down on wheat that even the worst price plunge in 29 years isn’t leaving them satisfied. 
 
Instead, a global glut has money managers ready for more losses and sticking with a net-bearish outlook for seven straight weeks. World inventories before the start of next year’s harvest are expected to climb to an all-time high as farmers reap bigger crops in the U.S., Russia and Ukraine. 
 
Wheat futures have tumbled 22 per cent since the end of June, heading for the worst quarterly loss since 1986. American farmers are particularly struggling because they’re saddled not just with bigger stockpiles, but also a rising dollar. The stronger currency is making exports from the U.S., the world’s top shipper, more expensive for overseas buyers. 
 
“You have a lot of producers around the world coming in with pretty solid crops,” said Sameer Samana, a St. Louis-based global quantitative strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, which oversees $1.6 trillion. “You have France, the U.S., Russia, Ukraine and others all jockeying to sell their wheat. That will probably continue to put pressure on prices.” 
 
The wheat net-short position, or bets on declines, totalled 39,382 futures and options in the week ended 15 September, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released three days later. The seven weeks of bearish outlook is the longest streak since late June. 
 
Futures dropped 18 per cent this year to $4.8325 a bushel in Chicago. The Bloomberg Commodity Index of 22 components fell 16 per cent. The MSCI All-Country World Index of equities dropped 5.9 percent, and the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index gained 6.1 per cent. 
 
There’s not a lot of demand for all that grain. In the U.S., commitments for exports this season are trailing last year’s pace by about 13 percent, government data show. French shippers are also having a hard time attracting buyers, and there’s so much excess supply in the country that some silo operators are maxed out. 
 
“Investors are perpetually short because it’s a market where you’ve got a crop coming out of just about every country in the world,” said John Stephenson, the chief executive officer of Stephenson & Co. Capital Management in Toronto, which oversees C$55 million ($41.6 million). “It’s so well-supplied globally that it’s never usually a problem getting your hands on wheat.”

7657,"The UN envoy for Syria discussed his peace proposals with officials in Damascus on Thursday, as Western fears grow that Russia is ramping up military support for President Bashar al-Assad.
Experts said Russia's steadfast backing for Assad and the growing waves of Syrians seeking refuge in the West might force Europe to abandon its goal of regime change to achieve peace.
The UN's Syria pointman Staffan de Mistura held talks with Foreign Minister Walid Muallem during his sixth visit to Damascus in search of an end to a four-year-old war in which 240,000 people have died.
""We will continue the meetings,"" de Mistura told reporters afterwards, declining to elaborate.
The visit comes after the envoy was strongly criticised by the Syrian government last month for ""making statements that lack objectivity and facts"" about deadly regime air raids.
According to Syria's official news agency SANA, de Mistura met with Muallem to address the regime's questions about the envoy's proposed 60-page peace plan.
The initiative, set to begin this month, was submitted to Damascus in mid-August by de Mistura's deputy, Ramzy Ezzeldin Ramzy.
It would set up four working groups to address safety and protection, counterterrorism, political and legal issues and reconstruction.
But Syria's regime does not want the committee's conclusions to be mandatory, a diplomat in Damascus told AFP.
SANA quoted de Mistura as saying the working groups' meetings ""would be for brainstorming and would not be binding"".
Muallem for his part said that ""fighting terrorism in Syria is the priority, and that it would be the gateway to a political solution in Syria"".
The regime refers to all of its opponents -- including non-violent activists -- as ""terrorists"".
Syria's Al-Watan newspaper, which is close to the government, said Thursday that the regime and Russia were ""on the same page concerning the solution to the crisis"" but that the UN had different priorities.
The Syrian and Russian leaders ""have signalled that there is no political solution without defeating terrorism. It's the only way to put an end to the war in Syria,"" the daily wrote.
But it said that de Mistura's plan ""is aligned with the positions held by the 'opposition coalition,' America, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia, who want the political solution to come before the fight against terrorism.""
The US, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia have been leading backers of the political and armed opposition throughout Syria's conflict, which has forced millions to flee since it broke out in 2011.
Washington has expressed serious concern in recent weeks that Russia, a decades-long backer of Syria's regime, is escalating its military aid to forces loyal to Assad.
Russia has reportedly moved artillery units and tanks to an airport in Assad's coastal stronghold in Latakia province, along with dozens of personnel and temporary housing for hundreds more.
US Secretary of State John Kerry said Wednesday that Moscow had proposed opening a ""military-to-military conversation"" with Washington to ensure that Russian forces do not come into conflict with a US-led coalition fighting Islamic State group jihadists.
Kerry did not specify whether the proposed dialogue would include a joint fight against IS.
Combined with Moscow's staunch backing for Assad, the arrival of thousands of Syrian asylum-seekers may also push Europe to adopt a new approach towards the regime, experts said.
""Indeed, after the migrant crisis, we heard several European voices pleading for a closer cooperation with Assad and (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,"" said Karim Bitar, head of research at the Paris-based Institute for International and Strategic Relations.
""Clearly, the 'stability at all costs' narrative is rapidly gaining ground. After the Libyan debacle and the unending Syrian tragedy, many people came to mistakenly believe that a return to authoritarianism is the only solution to the Middle East crisis,"" Bitar told AFP.
""The proponents of the 'Assad as a lesser-evil' theory are now more vocal and coming out openly in favour of a rapprochement with Assad to fight IS,"" he added.
IS meanwhile has called on Muslims to seek safety in its so-called ""caliphate"" in areas of Syria and Iraq under its control following a string of migrant shipwreck tragedies.
One IS-produced video, depicting refugees trying to reach Europe, says refugees ""are living under their (European countries) laws humiliated and submissive, instead of fleeing to the land of Muslims to live in dignity under its sword"".

909,"The resounding endorsement by global leaders last week in New York of the groundbreaking and transformational 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, more than two years in the making, sparks new hope and optimism for multilateralism. 
 
The 2030 Agenda, based on 17 goals and 169 targets, may seem overly ambitious to some, but poverty eradication cannot be sustained without comprehensive progress in economic growth, social justice and ecological sustainability. This is a bold and inspirational new roadmap that will guide us to more sustainable growth, which is resource-efficient and respects planetary boundaries－meeting our present needs without mortgaging the wellbeing of future generations. 
 
This change is urgently needed in the countries of Asia and the Pacific. Although our region has an impressive track record of economic growth and poverty reduction, more than 1.4 billion people still live in poverty, social disparities are widening and growth remains inefficient and wasteful. Our region has a shared responsibility to lead, which is why mainstreaming the 2030 Agenda in development plans and budgets, and backing them with strong oversight will be critical for successful implementation. 
 
Five conditions must be met to pave the way for Asia-Pacific governments to make this happen: 
 
First, sufficient financial resources are needed. The Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) estimates that the Asia-Pacific region will need to invest between $2.1 trillion and $2.5 trillion per year to fund a comprehensive agenda for sustainable development. These resources are available: regional national savings total nearly $8.9 trillion, financial assets of the wealthiest regional individuals are estimated to be about $35 trillion, and foreign exchange reserves account for more than $7 trillion. Most of these sources of savings are currently adding to liquidity, held dormant in deposits or financing third-party country deficits. We need instead to effectively harness them along with unwavering political commitment to exploit domestic resources for development. Developing economies of our region have, on an average, among the lowest tax-to-GDP ratios in the world. Leveraging the potential of strengthened tax regimes is key; public interest must override the vested interests so that governments can remove tax exemptions and tackle tax evasion practices which are obstacles to investment in better access to basic services. 
 
Second, good governance and inclusion has to be embedded in policy execution and implementation. The capacities of governments to engage multiple interest groups with widely varying perspectives, to effectively regulate excesses, monitor policy impacts and adjust policy responses are now critical. Governments must also become more adept at dealing with the unexpected and unpredictable events－and enabling all groups in society to respond positively to environmental, economic or social shocks. 
 
Third, innovations, new technologies and associated know-how must drive sustainable development across the region, yet innovation gaps in Asia and the Pacific remain very large. Only five Asia-Pacific countries are featured in the top 20 of the 2014 Global Innovation Index. Effective alignment and reinforcement of science, technology and innovation, through the right policies and regulatory frameworks as well as partnerships to facilitate technology transfer, will be mission-critical for successful sustainability. 
 
Fourth, we need to pair innovation with resources, enabling countries to find and adapt the best policy options for sustainability. Partnerships and stronger, more diversified regional platforms for South-South cooperation, such as those provided by ESCAP and its Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development, provide great opportunities for our region to lead the way in ending poverty, transforming lives and protecting the planet. 
 
Fifth, climate action must be integrated across all areas of policy and governance－social, environmental and economic. While emissions must be reduced through a focus on low-carbon energy, transportation and buildings and through energy efficiency, we must also build more resilient societies, prepared for frequent and extreme weather events and their impacts, such as changes in food production systems and migration.

5067,"The Founder and Executive Director, Centre for Aviation Safety and Research (CASR), Engr. Shery Kyari, has called on the Federal Government to fish out the oil marketers that were allegedly selling kerosene to airline operators as aviation fuel. Kyari, who is also an Aircraft Maintenance Engineer, made the call at the third Engr. Zakari Haruna Memorial Lecture at the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) Annex, international wing of the Murtala Muhammed Airport (MMA), Lagos. 

He wondered why oil marketers would go to the extent of selling kerosene to unsuspecting airlines, thereby compromising safety of the passengers and the aircraft itself. 

According to him, ""I wonder why oil marketers will sell kerosene to airline operators as kerosene for their operations. We want to believe that the Federal Government will react to this by fishing out the marketers who did this and deal with them decisively."" 

He continued, ""It is dangerous to the industry. It undermines safety as well as threaten safety."" 

The Chief Executive Officer of Alpha First Aviation School, Elder Soji Amusan, who spoke on the topic, ""Expanding Air Passengers Base In Aviation"" stated that air transport is a very important base of the global economy. 

He stated that less than 10 percent of Nigerians travel by air, adding that to increase the number of people travelling by air in the country, Nigeria must have a coherent transport policy. 

Amusan argued that if there had been coherent transport policy most of the airports in the country would have witnessed a lot of expansion. 

He listed some of the factors militating against the increase in air passenger traffic to include bad managers, adding that most Nigerian airlines were prone to bad management just like the liquidated Nigeria Airways Limited (NAL). 

He added that bad managers brought about the short life span of NAL in the country. 

Other factors according to him are decaying facilities, insecurity and intermittent air crashes, a situation he said scared away those who would have loved to go by air transport.",2d936564-2d2b-4c3a-b238-9e8472498d4d,News,2015-09-20T14:09:11Z,Individual.com,Contaminated Aviation Fuel - Expert Urges FG to Expose Culprits,0.0,News

4096,"Airbus A330-200 VH-EBE touches down in Brisbane after operating flight JQ6 from Honolulu. (Daniel Foster) 
Jetstar has completed the transition of its long-haul flying to an all-Boeing 787 operation, with its final Airbus A330 service touching down on Friday when VH-EBE operating flight JQ6 from Honolulu to Brisbane landed just before 1700 local time. 
 
It marks the end of a two-year transition from the A330-200 to the 787-8, following delivery of Jetstar’s first Dreamliner in October 2013 . The A330s have been progressively transferred to parent Qantas as the 787s have entered servcie. 
 
Jetstar now has 11 787-8s flying on international routes across the Asia-Pacic, as well as a few domestic services within Australia. The Qantas Group’s low-cost carrier also plans to use the 787 on trans-Tasman services  over summer . 
 
And the 787-8 will touch down in Wuhan, China on September 30 when Jetstar begins new twice weekly flights from the Gold Coast in partnership with Chinese conglomerate Wanda Group. 
 
Jetstar said on Friday there would be more than 300 Chinese visitors on the inaugural Wuhan-Gold Coast service. 
 
“These new flights from Wuhan will be a boon for local tourism with some 70,000 seats a year on offer between the Gold Coast and one of China’s fastest growing cities,” Jetstar head of commercial for Australia and New Zealand Nigel Fanning said in a statement. 
 
“With a population of more than 10 million, Wuhan is the largest city in central China and it’s a great sign for the Gold Coast that we’re off to such a strong start with flight bookings.”

2682,"Kaley Cuoco is divorcing her husband of 21 months. 

					  		     
The 'Big Bang Theory' star has split from her tennis player spouse Ryan Sweeting less than two years after their wedding on December 31, 2013. 

					  		     
A representative for the actress told PEOPLE.com: “Kaley Cuoco and Ryan Sweeting have mutually decided to end their marriage. They ask for privacy at this time. No further statement will be issued regarding this matter.” 

					  		     
The 29-year-old beauty has also deleted all traces of her estranged husband on her Instagram account and unfollowed him across her various social media accounts. 

					  		     
While Kaley is yet to offer any official comments on the impendingm divorce, the comedy star did post a picture of a rather distressed looking puppy on her Instagram account and captioned it writing: “#mood”. 

					  		     
The news of Kaley and Ryan's split comes just a week after the actress revealed her spouse was great friends with her ex-boyfriend and 'Big Bang Theory' co-star Johnny Galecki. 

						  				  		        		    		  		     
Speaking on 'Watch What Happens Live,' Kaley said: “Well, we dated like five years ago, so I think we both moved on. Johnny is actually one of my best friends. It's a situation that ended well.

5978,"A woman was arrested in Rogers on Sunday for not turning in three library books, according to the Rogers City Prosecutor’s Office. Megan Owens-Jordan was arrested on suspicion of theft of rental property,  handcuffed and told she had a $3,000 bond Sunday, Owens-Jordan and Keith Foster with the Rogers Police Department told 40/29 News. Police released her with a written citation and court date after they learned the warrant had been issued on three overdue library items, Owens-Jordan said. Owens-Jordan admitted to 40/29 News she had checked out The Lego Book, the Everyone Worth Knowing audiobook and the Husbands audiobook, and had not returned them.  “I understand them wanting their books and/or money. That is valid. I just don’t get that it is potential jail time for 3 books,” Owens-Jordan told 40/29 News. The Rogers Public Library only refers overdue items to prosecutors after writing at least 4 letters or e-mails to the person with the overdue items and calling them at least once, according to Judy Casey, Rogers Public Library Director. Owens-Jordan told 40/29 News she moved last August and may not have gotten those letters. She told 40/29 News she did not get a phone call. The library takes theft seriously because people are taking taxpayer property, said Casey. It can also make it difficult for taxpayers who wish to use the property that is missing, said Casey. The library has asked for 10-15 warrants to be issued on overdue items since the beginning of 2014, according to Bonnie Bridges, Staff Attorney with the Rogers Attorney’s Office. Most of the time, the cases are dropped when people either return the items or pay to replace them, Bridges said. The library told the city attorney’s office the replacement cost of the items is $279.50, Bridges said. The library usually pays a higher price for items than what you would see on Amazon or at Barnes Noble, Casey told 40/29 News. That is because the library gets special editions that are more durable than ones available at retail, said Casey. Many items, especially audiobooks, often come with warranties, said Casey.

4768,"Left to right: Niall Horan, Harry Styles, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson of One Direction are playing the Roundhouse in Camden during the Apple Music Festival 

One Direction have announced their fifth album Made In The A.M will be released on November 13.

The title and release date of the new album, which is available to pre-order now, was unveiled via a video message featuring the band.

Made In The A.M follows the massive success of Drag Me Down - the first single released from the album - which topped the UK Singles Chart, climbed to third spot in the Billboard Chart in the US and broke streaming records globally. 

Harry Styles said Infinity, another track from the album, has also been released ""as a little treat"" for anyone who pre-orders the album or streams through online retailers. 

The song is written by John Ryan, Jamie Scott and Julian Bunetta, the team behind One Direction smash Story Of My Life.

It is said to showc ase a more mature sound for the band which fans can expect from the new album. 

Liam Payne tweeted the album name to fans, adding: "" Can't wait for you all to hear it!"" 

One Direction will kick off the UK and Irish leg of their On The Road Again Tour with six nights at London's O2 Arena from Thursday, September 24, as well as headlining the Apple Music Festival at the Roundhouse in London tonight, supported by special guests Little Mix.

Niall Horan tweeted his excitement about the gig, writing: ""really can't wait for the apple music festival... at the roundhouse. My favourite London venue ... Looking forward to seeing you all.""

Last month the band hit the headlines over rumours about their future - shocking millions of devoted fans. They have confirmed they are taking a break.

Both One Direction and Little Mix found fame on The X Factor, with the boy band having gone on to enjoy global success, acquiring millions of fans who are known as ''Directioners''.

Little Mix, who won the ITV talent show in 2011, have also had success on both sides of the Atlantic.

The bands have been linked due to former One Direction star Zayn Malik having been engaged to Perrie Edwards from Little Mix.

But reports that the pair had split emerged in August. The pop star duo got engaged in 2013 but had never publicly announced a wedding date. 

The Apple Music Festival, which offered fans the opportunity to win free tickets to see their favourite performers, has already featured concerts by Ellie Goulding, Take That and Carrie Underwood.

One Direction fans turned up 24 hours before the show to set up camp in a bid to get last-minute tickets.

Emily Davis, 20, and Megan Hilson, 19, from Manchester, did not have tickets so arrived at 8.30pm on Monday night to get to the front of the standby queue. 

Miss Davis, who has previously travelled to Brussels and New York to see the band, said: ""It has been raining all day, it has been wet, we are soggy, I am cold, but it's worth it.""

Tickets for the gig are more in demand than ever as the boy band announced they will be taking a hiatus for at least a year from March so this will be one of their final shows.

Although tickets could be won through competitions, super-fans, also known as Directioners, camped overnight in the rain in the hope of getting any tickets not used by competition winners.

Nenah Kedman, 23, from London, has a ticket but arrived at 4am to make sure she was at the front of the audience.

She said: ""This is probably the smallest venue I will ever see them in and especially as they are now doing an arena tour it is going to be impossible to ever get this close to them again so I thought if I am going to come here, I am going to come here and do it in style and be right at the front and just have a great experience.""

Miguel Tello, 31, from London, put up a tent during the early hours, next to others who took it in turns to save each other's places while they had toilet breaks at nearby businesses.

He said: ""It is hard because it was raining last night. It was really cold but this show is really special because actually it is like you never know when it is going to happen again because they are having a break in March.""",9e75bc8a-f724-4297-9149-0d6164107335,News,2015-09-22T01:55:24Z,Congleton Guardian,New One Direction album Made In The A.M to be released in November,0.0,News

2856,"LOS ANGELES (Top40 Charts) Lakeshore Records will release THE RUNNER - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack digitally on September 25, 2015. The album features original music by The Newton Brothers (OCULUS, LIFE OF CRIME). 
In the aftermath of the 2010 BP oil spill, an idealistic but flawed politician (Nicolas Cage) is forced to confront his dysfunctional life after his career is destroyed in a sex scandal. Also stars Sarah Paulson, Connie Nielsen, Wendell Pierce, Bryan Batt and Peter Fonda. 

Composers Andy Grush and Taylor Newton Stewart, better known as The Newton Brothers, drew inspiration for their score from both the humanity of the film's characters and the tense political climate that serves as a backdrop. Collaborating with director Austin Stark, The Newton Brothers sought to find a musical balance befitting of the movie's vision. ""We had the political aspect of the film which we scored one way, and then Colin Price and his inner-struggles as another tone. We needed something minimal and intimate for Colin's internal struggle to capture the humanity of his situation. It provides commentary on how we deal with vulnerability, life, and change - which is something everyone can connect with,"" explained Stewart. 

The Newton Brothers achieved the musical balance by creating a hybrid score combining electronic and symphonic elements with unique instrumentation. Stewart described, ""For the connection between Colin and Kate Haber (Paulson), we relied on a solo electric guitar for a very fragile and emotional theme which expresses their connection and character development. To keep the political world separate, we spent a lot of time coming up with subtle percussive elements and synth arpeggio's to chug along in the background of various scenes to keep the 'real world' always moving around the story of Colin."" The composers also bowed a Bazantar and developed percussion patterns from recorded sounds of banging on guitars and dobros. 

As The Newton Brothers, Andy Grush and Taylor Stewart have developed a reputation as innovative composers pushing the boundaries of film and television music. Between the two, they play piano, guitar, bass, clarinet, flute, accordion, sax, harmonica, percussion, organ, kazoo, and cello. They fuse their classical education with skill and savvy in electronics and manipulated sounds to contribute distinct music to a diverse spectrum of film projects and capitalize on having two musical heads. The Newton Brothers added chills to Mike Flanagan's OCULUS, emotion to Tony Kaye's acclaimed classroom drama DETACHMENT tension to Mike Gunther's crime thriller SETUP starring Bruce Willis, and black humor to PAWN SHOP CHRONICLES starring Paul Walker. They recently lent their ""Newtonian"" approach to the dark comedy LIFE OF CRIME starring Jennifer Aniston, and the action/thriller THE PRINCE starring Bruce Willis and John Cusack. 

The Newton Brothers' upcoming projects include comedy CHLOE & THEO starring Dakota Johnson and Mira Sorvino, the Mike Flanagan thriller BEFORE I WAKE which they co-scored with Danny Elfman, the comedy DRIVE, SHE SAID with Jason Biggs and Ashley Tisdale, and season 2 of ABC Family drama CHASING LIFE.

674,"Beijing, Sept. 21  — Bracing for its ambitious plan to land an unmanned spacecraft on the moon before returning to Earth, China has shipped a carrier rocket from Tianjin port for a rehearsal of a scheduled Chang'e-5 lunar mission around 2017. 
 
 
It will be the first drill carried out in a launch site that involves both the carrier rocket and a probe, the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense said. It did not locate the launch site. 
 
The Long March-5 carrier rocket was designed by China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology with the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation. 
 
It is scheduled to make its first trial flight in 2016. 
 
With a payload capacity of 14 tonnes to geostationary transfer orbit, the largest carrying capacity in China, the rocket will greatly increase China's ability to enter space. 
 
China plans to launch its Chang'e-5 lunar probe carried by the Long March-5 carrier rocket around 2017 to finish the last chapter in China's three-step (orbiting, landing and return) moon exploration program. 
 
The final phase involved landing the rover and return back to earth. 
 
Chang'e-5 is expected to achieve several breakthroughs, including automatic sampling, ascending from the moon without a launch site and an unmanned docking 400,000 kilometers above the lunar surface. (PNA/PTI)

1687,"(CNN) -  
The Senate moved Wednesday to prevent the first part of a multi-step budget crisis when it voted overwhelmingly to keep the government funded through Dec. 11. 
 
The bill passed 78 to 20 and now goes to the House, which must act before midnight to prevent a shutdown, and House Republican leaders have said they plan to pass the bill in time. 

Meanwhile, top-level negotiations between Republican leaders in Congress and the White House to resolve the remaining steps -- including a longer-term government funding bill, an increase in the debt ceiling, approval of new funds for highway construction, passage of expiring tax provisions -- could begin ""very soon,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday. 

But those talks could be marred before even getting started after McConnell insisted in a phone call last week with President Barack Obama that House and Senate Democratic leaders not be allowed at the table, a demand the President refused to accept, multiple officials told CNN. 

McConnell has suggested for weeks he expected to open talks directly with the White House, bypassing Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, Sen. Chuck Schumer and other Democratic leaders with whom he has a tenuous relationship. A spokesman for McConnell wouldn't comment on why he wanted to bar Democrats from the talks. 

White House officials also declined to discuss the call, which took place last Thursday just before Obama met with Reid and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi in the Oval Office, according to a Pelosi aide. But they pointed to recent comments by White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest who said that Democrats must be part of any negotiation. 

Reid insisted Tuesday he would be part of any negotiations. 

""We've been calling for responsible budget negotiations for months,"" he said. ""If there are any talks, I will be invited."" 

McConnell said he hoped the stopgap spending measure would ""allow time for cooler heads to prevail."" 

News of the anticipated but long-awaited talks came days after House Speaker John Boehner, a known dealmaker, complicated the process by announcing he would leave Congress at the end of October. It was not clear what impact his sudden departure would have on what will be his final major budget negotiation. But some Democrats -- who fear Boehner's replacement will cower to demands from the right not to cut a deal -- said they hope Boehner will wrap up all the remaining issues before retiring. 

""I would hope that Boehner would make it easier on the people who are going to follow him,"" Reid said. ""Get it all done before he leaves."" 

In an interview on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday, Boehner suggested he may want to do just that. 

""I don't want to leave my successor a dirty barn. I want to clean the barn up a little bit before the next person gets there,"" Boehner said. 

McConnell said he had ""no earthly idea"" how much work would be completed before Boehner leaves. 

""We are going to have to deal with all of these issues between now and December 11,"" McConnell said. ""How much of that could come together before Speaker Boehner leaves, I have no earthly idea."" 

At issue in the negotiations is how much to spend on the government operations. 

Many Republicans want to break existing budget caps to increase spending for defense while most Democrats want to break the caps to increase funding for domestic programs. But the conservatives in the House who helped force Boehner's exit say they want to rein in government spending and don't want to break the caps at all. 

McConnell said one of his biggest priorities in the talks will be to set a top line spending figure for this year and 2016, which would allow Congress to carry out a normal appropriations process next year. Washington has run on ""continuing resolutions"" for some time, which don't allow Congress to make changes to the way money is spent or to alter policies within government agencies. 

""Let us at least be honest. With a continuing resolution, no waste will be cut. No spending will be cut. No regulations will be stopped. And the debt will continue to mount,"" Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said in a floor speech explaining why he would vote against the continuing resolution.",533e7b29-68ad-4656-b297-cb344fb2bcc0,News,2015-09-30T15:31:56Z,WCYB-TV,Senate OKs bill to fund government until Dec. 11,0.0,News

Containers & Microservices Expo To Be Colocated with @DevOpsSummit Silicon Valley, November 3-5, 2015 at the Santa Clara Convention Center, CA 
SYS-CON Events announced on June 9, 2015 at the Javits Center that the 2nd ""Containers & Microservices Conference"" will take place November 3-5, 2015, at the Santa Clara Convention Center, Santa Clara, CA, and the ""Third Containers & Microservices Conference"" will take place June 7-9, 2016, at Javits Center in New York City. 
 
Containers and microservices have become topics of intense interest throughout the cloud developer and enterprise IT communities. 
 
Microservices focuses on the business and technology of the software architecture design pattern, in which complex applications are composed of small, independent processes communicating with each other using language-agnostic APIs. 
 
Containers are not being considered for the first time by the cloud community, but a current era of re-consideration has pushed them to the top of the cloud agenda. 
 
Rather than just stuff an OS into a container, for example, developers and deployers should consider a spectrum of microservices and what they can do.

London: A French firm has designed a conceptual shelter for future astronauts on Mars that would be 3D-printed on the red planet using locally-available materials. 
Resembling an igloo from the surface, the shelter, dubbed Sfero, would be partially buried beneath the ground. Access to the shelter would be gained by its one long corridor, which contains an airlock.

A piece of African culture will be showcased at the Zion Evangelical Missionary Church in New Sarepta next month. 
 
The African Children's Choir, composed of 18 kids between the ages of eight to 11, will perform a collection of African and traditional songs, says choir chaperone Emily Gronow, a volunteer from Cardiff, Wales. 
 
“It will be jam packed with lots of singing and dancing. There will be African songs and more traditional songs that will be familiar to the audience like Amazing Grace, He’s Got the Whole World in His Hands, This Little Light of Mine. They do a lot of drumming and [wear] beautiful costumes as well,” she said, adding audiences are impressed by what they see.  
 
“A lot of the time people come up so positive about the program, all of the children’s energy levels and the dancing. We’ve been really overwhelmed with the concerts in Canada. Everybody seems so positive and supportive.” 
 
The choir doesn’t sell tickets to its concerts but rather accepts donations.  
 
The proceeds go towards every choir child’s education and the Music For Life program which helps improve lives and offers education for children in Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, South Sudan, South Africa, Nigeria and Ghana.  
 
Every year the organizers choose a different group of kids to tour from February until the end of the calendar year. The children then return to complete their education. 
 
The choir started their Canadian leg of the tour at the end of May and will wrap up in November. 
 
The African Children’s Choir was founded in 1984 by Irish ordained minister Ray Barnett as a way to lift children and their families out of poverty.",7beb4989-15e9-4e17-aa4f-26fc04ec012b,News,2015-09-17T22:28:55Z,Leduc Representative,African Children’s Choir performing,0.0,News

6476,"Text Size: ASmall Text AMedium Text ALarge Text Photos Mason Cohn/CNNMoney Looks like the Facebook ""Dislike"" button might finally happen. The company's CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg said as much during a Q&A Tuesday.
""I think people have asked about the dislike button for many years. Today is a special day because today is the day I can say we’re working on it and shipping it,"" Zuckerberg said, according to a report in Business Insider.
Zuckerberg said that the social network didn't immediately design the button because it didn't want to turn into something like Reddit, with a system of upvoting and downvoting.
""That isn’t what we’re here to build in the world,"" Zuckerberg said. He added that the company realized Facebook users didn't necessarily want to downvote each other, they just wanted to have another option to ""Liking.""
Last December, during another Q&A interview at Facebook headquarters, Zuckerberg said that while the social network was mulling over a ""dislike"" button for users, he thought then that it might not happen.
""Some people have asked for a Dislike button because they want to be able to say ‘That thing isn’t good’. And that’s not something that we think is good for the world. So we’re not going to build that,"" he said in answer to a question why the ""dislike"" button hasn't emerged. ""I don’t think there needs to be a voting mechanism about whether posts are good or bad. I don’t think that’s socially very valuable or good for the community to help people share the important moments in their lives.""
Zuckerberg also talked about his favorite emoji or sticker on Facebook at Tuesday's meeting. It's the cactus.

Michigan State's RJ Williamson tackles Air Force's DeAnthony Arnett during second half action on Saturday, September 19, 2015 at Spartan Stadium in East Lansing Michigan. (Photo: Kirthmon F. Dozier, DFP) 

EAST LANSING  --  Were there concerns? Of course. 

Promising results? Without seeing the tape, Michigan State coaches felt there were at least some. 

Harlon Barnett’s main reason to be happy after Saturday’s 35-21 victory? 

“Thank God we’re done with Air Force,” said the Spartans’ first-year co-defensive coordinator. 

Fourth-ranked MSU began readying to face the Falcons’ deceptive triple option offensive attack during spring practices. Coaches said they continued to sprinkle in a preparation period throughout preseason camp in August. 

It resulted in a bend-but-don’t-break performance Saturday. Air Force’s 279 rushing yards were the most since the Spartans allowed since conceding 313 yards to Nebraska on Nov. 3, 2012. The Falcons averaged 5.5 yards per carry. 

Senior safety RJ Williamson said the Spartans “don’t normally see teams like this.” 

Part of why the Spartans devoted extra time to Air Force, which is rare for coaches while prepping for other games, is that playing against a triple option goes against much of what coach Mark Dantonio and his staff teach defensively about swarming to the ball. One missed assignment by overpursuing the wrong Falcon could lead to big plays. 

At times, it did. However, MSU players avoided mental fatigue thanks in part to Dantonio rotating players throughout the game. 

“I think you look at things and correct things and you learn from it,” Dantonio said. “You put this in the bank and say, ‘This is a way we did this.’ … But it will be a different offense next week, so we’ll go back to what we do a little bit more, but there’s components of it that we’ll use.” 

Once MSU began keying on the run, the Falcons opened up their rarely used passing attack. Backup senior quarterback Karson Roberts was 5 of 8 passing for 150 yards in the second half. 

Roberts faked an option run to his left, and hit receiver Jalen Robinette in stride behind the befuddled MSU secondary for a 38-yard touchdown that made it 35-14. 

The Spartans got a pair of fourth-down stops in the red zone, as well as a fumble return touchdown and an interception from Williamson. 

“They have a good team,” Air Force coach Troy Calhoun said. 

The Spartans won’t face another triple option team this season, which renders much of the preparation and some of the problems a one-game issue. 

Dantonio cited missed tackles and improper technique in taking on blocks that will command fixing. 

“When it comes for us to play those types of teams and run into other teams who excel in the option, then we know how to stop it, because we’ve been there before and we can make adjustments from there,” Williamson said. “But as far as today? I don’t think we look at it too much.”

3358,"(BPT) - An estimated 2.7 million Americans suffer from atrial fibrillation (AFib), an irregular heartbeat and the most common form of cardiac arrhythmia, according to the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. Surprisingly, many people do not feel any symptoms until they are suffering from complications of AFib such as heart failure or stroke. 
  
September is Atrial Fibrillation Awareness Month. Take the time to understand your risk for AFib, and the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. One out of every four strokes in the United States is a result of AFib, according to the American Heart Association. Patients who experience a stroke caused by AFib are twice as likely to be severely disabled, a 1996 Framingham Study found. Stroke prevention and heart failure prevention are primary treatment goals in AFib. 
 
Who is at risk for AFib? 
 
There are a number of risk factors associated with AFib, including existing heart conditions, prior heart attack or recent heart surgery. People who are overweight, have high blood pressure, lung or thyroid issues or are under a lot of stress may also have an increased risk for AFib. 
 
Additionally, the risk for AFib increases with age, especially after 60. There is also a genetic component to AFib, so if someone in the family has it, the more likely the next generation will have it too. Without treatment, AFib can lead to serious health consequences, including: 
 
* Heart failure 
 
* Stroke 
 
* Fatigue 
 
* Shortness of breath 
 
What are the symptoms of AFib? 
 
Each year, millions of patients see physicians because they feel heart palpitations or report their heart is racing, quivering or fluttering, which are the most common symptoms of AFib. Other signs may include general fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath, anxiety or weakness. However, some people with “silent” AFib have no symptoms at all and their condition is only detected when they go in for a physical exam or have a medical event. In fact, a third of Americans who have AFib are still undiagnosed, noted a 2015 report from the American Heart Association. 
 
Early diagnosis and treatment is key 
 
Early detection of AFib is critical to reduce unnecessary medical visits and prevent serious complications. However, AFib can occur intermittently or without symptoms, making it difficult to detect and diagnose. 
 
If a physician suspects AFib, they will typically conduct a physical examination and heart-monitoring tests. Traditional heart monitoring methods include an electrocardiogram (ECG) to measure the timing and duration of each electrical signal of the heart. 
 
New advancements in technology such as wireless, long-term, continuous cardiac monitors have significantly improved how AFib is diagnosed and managed. For example, iRhythm’s ZIO Service with a biosensor patch has the ability to monitor and store patients' heartbeats for up to 14 days, catching any hard to detect events that may be missed with older technology. The long-term continuous monitoring allows physicians to rule in, or even rule out, the diagnosis and characterization of AFib and potentially eliminating the need for further testing and resulting in faster treatment. 
 
Talk to your doctor 
 
While AFib may not sound serious, it can actually be life threatening. Understand your risk and treatment options, and take the necessary next steps to live a healthier lifestyle, including eating heart healthy foods, exercising regularly and minimizing stress.

1703,"A Key Largo man was arrested Tuesday, charged with forging someone else’s name on the title of a boat trailer and selling it without the owner’s permission. The owner of the 30 foot Load Master trailer was storing it at the Snake Creek Marina. She told Sgt. Eric Mixon she’d been dealing at the marina with a man named Abraham Vaught. She said at one point, Vaught offered to buy the trailer for $1,400 but she refused because she thought it was worth more than that. She said she went to the marina on July 20th and found the trailer missing. She went to the local tag office and found the trailer had been sold and was registered in the name of a woman who lives in Miami Lakes, Florida. Detective Yunier Galvez was assigned to investigate and he spoke to the trailer’s new owner. She said she’d recently bought a boat from Snake Creek Marina. She said she’d been dealing with Vaught at the marina, who identified himself as the marina manager. She said she also purchased a trailer from him. She said as she was purchasing the trailer, she saw Vaught sign the name “Michael Smith” as the seller on the bill of sale. When she asked why he was signing someone else’s name, he said he had power of attorney to do so. She said she paid Vaught $2,000 for the trailer and then registered it in her name using the bill of sale he gave her. Detective Galvez obtained a warrant for the arrest of 34 year old Michael Abraham Vaught. He was charged Tuesday with two counts of grand theft, dealing in stolen property, forgery and uttering a false or forged document.",ca03fd86-0f28-4241-9ce2-a1a65368dc46,Blog,2015-09-02T11:26:22Z,Monroe County Sheriff's Office,Man arrested for selling boat trailer illegally,1.0,News
6238,"THE Roosters stunned the defending premiers with a 30-0 win at Allianz Stadium on Friday night. 

""They haven't defended in about 10 minutes.""

That wasn't a statement made by a commentator or a Roosters fan during the 30-0 win over South Sydney at Allianz Stadium on Friday night. Rather it was referee Gerard Sutton describing the Roosters' opening onslaught to Gavin Badger. 

The Roosters stunned the defending premiers, racing in three tries in the first 15 minutes, to be the first club to win three consecutive minor premierships since Manly's run in 1995-1997. It means the Roosters will most probably host Cronulla or Melbourne in week one of the finals, while a grand final rematch with Canterbury looms as the most likely week-one opponent for Souths. 

The only sour note for the Roosters was in-form five-eighth James Maloney being placed on report for tripping. After a turnover, Maloney stuck his foot out which connected with Kyle Turner. 

While a grade-one trip will see him not miss a game, Maloney could be hit with the more severe charge of dangerous contact, with a grade one charge opening the possibility of him missing one game. With Mitchell Pearce sidelined for at least another week, any Maloney ban could halt the Roosters' charge. Teammate Dylan Napa was also placed on report for a crusher tackle.

Maloney again starred for the home side in front of 25,019 people, laying on two tries. His left-edge partnership alongside Boyd Cordner, Michael Jennings and Daniel Tupou was lethal.

The Roosters' big men easily rolled through the middle while Roger Tuivasa-Sheck impressed so much that Immortal Andrew Johns declared the Roosters fullback could go down as the best ever Kiwi player by the end of his career. 

The rattled Rabbitohs side had little answer to the Roosters in the first 40 minutes. Greg Inglis will be added to the South Sydney line-up ahead of their do-or-die semi-final next week. 

Rabbitohs coach Michael Maguire tried to gain the momentum early by starting the Burgess boys. He also kept Alex Johnston at fullback following Dylan Walker's mixed return at the back last week.

The victory was the Roosters' 11th in a row but leaves their arch-rivals season on life support.

A solo effort by Michael Jennings, who shrugged away Joel Reddy, saw the Roosters open the scoring after eight minutes.

Centre partner Blake Ferguson would have the next when he jumped largely uncontested for a Maloney bomb to help extend the lead to 12. Maloney's boot produced the next points when Tupou fought for the high kick with Reddy before Cordner pounced on the loose ball to score. Corner laid on the next try with the latest of offloads, for Jake Friend to cross. 

Not to be underdone by the left edge's dominance, the Roosters' right side got in on the action. With Maloney and halves partner Jackson Hastings lined out for a wide shift, the Roosters went the short side via Tuivasa-Sheck, who fed Aidan Guerra into a hole to give the back-rower his fifth try of the season.

The Rabbitohs controlled the ball better in the second half. While they dominated possession and territory, they still struggled to threaten the Roosters defensive line. With 15 minutes remaining in the second half, the Roosters had already completed more tackles than they were forced to make in the entire opening 40. Despite not adding to their first-half score, the Roosters defence was as impressive as their first half attack.

Rabbitohs back-rower Chris McQueen was sin-binned for holding down Mitchell Aubusson, who was denied from scoring what would have been a contender for try of the season.

373,"The German automakers really know how to make Coupes such as the A5/S5 from Audi (updating soon), the 4- and 6-Series models from BMW, and from Mercedes Benz, the S-class Coupe and this latest C-Class Coupe. Mercedes is on a style roll with these coupes that look sleek, aerodynamic, and muscular/aggressive all at the same time. While the press release is a global one, you can guess the engines and equipment that will come to the US. Expect the turbo fours and the eight-speed auto at the very least. It would be nice to get the more-powerful diesel in the C-Class Coupe as well, but... The new C Coupe gets all of Mercedes' latest like the AMG equipment, Agility Control. Airmatic suspension, DISTRONIC PLUS (with Steering Assist and Stop&Go Pilot), AS PLUS Brake Assist System, Active Lane Keeping Assist, PRE‑SAFE® occupant protection, and much more as standard equipment or available in packages. The new body is stiffer and lighter which should aid performance and fuel economy. In other words, like most Mercedes models here in the US, you can spend lots of money or go crazy with the options and spend even more money. But look what you get...a new Coupe that is certainly worth lusting after. Mercedes will begin the roll out of the new C-Class Coupes in December.

Press Release:
The new C-Class Coupé: Seduction of the heart and mind
Mercedes-Benz is adding a Coupé to its C-Class family. Athletic and sporty, the vivid, sensual design of the new Coupé cuts a fine figure on the road and embodies modern luxury. At the same time, its interior raises elegance and style to a sporty level. A dynamically configured chassis, with optional air suspension, forms the basis for a high level of suspension comfort, low road roar and tyre vibration, agile handling, and driving pleasure. Lightweight construction to reduce weight, excellent aerodynamics and high-performance yet efficient engines likewise contribute to this. New assistance systems provide safety of the very highest calibre. With its high-class appeal and generous interior, the new C-Class Coupé sets new standards in its segment. It arrives in December 2015.
""Our new C-Class Coupé continues the philosophy of our exciting coupés. It combines thrilling design with agile sportiness and modern luxury. The C-Class Coupé therefore clearly pledges itself to stylish driving enjoyment,"" states Prof. Dr. Thomas Weber, member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG and responsible for Group Research and Mercedes-Benz Cars Development. As the sportiest variant of the C-Class, the Coupé displays its driving enjoyment-oriented character in an emotive and at the same time formally distinct design. A sportily striking front section featuring diamond radiator grille and long bonnet – the new Coupé is 60 millimetres longer than its predecessor between the firewall and front axle alone – gives way to a low greenhouse whose lines flow into a bold and powerful-looking rear end incorporating the Mercedes coupé genes. A high beltline and frameless doors with free-standing exterior mirrors underscore the sporty character. Clean lines and sensually arranged surfaces structure the side sections into vivid light and shadow effects. One particular highlight is the long drawn-out dropping line typical of a coupé. In contrast to the C-Class Saloon, the dropping line extends further past the rear wheel arch. To underscore the Coupé's sporty disposition, the suspension is 15 millimetres lower than that of the Saloon, making it a very sporty proposition when combined with the standard 17-inch tyres. Interior: generous, dynamic, exquisite
The interior is likewise a statement of the Mercedes-Benz design philosophy and combines emotion with intelligence. Although it exudes athletic and youthful charm, it has grown in maturity. Driver and passengers enjoy an ambience that leans toward the interior of the C-Class Saloon yet raises it to a new, sporty level. Flowing forms characterise the centre console as well as the door and rear side panelling, which smoothly merge into one another to emphasise the coupé character. The individually designed trim elements underscore the sporty character of the interior. A seating system including integral sports seats designed specifically for the Coupé offers sporty comfort. Plus there is an automatic belt feeder for added convenience. The choice of materials and the finish have a hand-crafted feel with high-class appeal and deliver a new take on modern luxury: sportiness without compromising on comfort and exquisite style. With an 80 millimetre longer wheelbase, the C-Class Coupé is 95 millimetres longer and 40 millimetres wider. The increased vehicle volume above all creates more spaciousness for the driver and front passenger. There is more shoulder room, elbow room and headroom in all seats. The unique position of the new C-Class Coupé is emphasised by the special upholstery colour combinations: saddle brown, porcelain and – in the Edition 1 – nut brown/black with turquoise topstitching. Individual highlights
The Coupé features a wealth of equipment as standard. The AMG Line is available as an alternative to further underline the dynamism of the Coupé. It differs by virtue of exterior features such as special bumpers and sills featuring AMG bodystyling, a diamond radiator grille with pins in chrome and 18-inch AMG light-alloy wheels. Interior highlights of the AMG Line include sportily exclusive touches such as upholstery in ARTICO man-made leather/DINAMICA microfibre in black with contrasting topstitching, a multifunction sports steering wheel with flattened bottom section and AMG sports pedals. The trim in open-pore black ash, combined with aluminium in the dashboard and the doors, emphasises the look. Another eye-catching feature is the optional Interior Chrome package featuring numerous highlights shrouded in silver chrome, including the instrument cluster, the air vents and the door openers. Suspension – sportily agile and comfortable
The suspension offers a high level of comfort with low road roar and tyre vibration whilst ensuring agile driving dynamics – the basis for driving enjoyment. A new 4-link front axle with wheel suspension decoupled from the spring strut plays a part in the agile handling characteristics. This enables sporty axle kinematics for plenty of grip and high lateral stability. As a result, the suspension responds more sensitively to steering movements and allows a sporty, agile driving style. Multi-link independent rear suspension with 5 links ensures excellent wheel location qualities and supreme straight-line stability. The Coupé comes with steel suspension as standard. There are two variants with selective damping system available in conjunction with this suspension, each of which is 15 millimetres lower than on the Saloon:
Comfortable AGILITY CONTROL suspension with a sporty character Sports suspension with tauter springing and damping including Sports Direct-Steer system for even more agile handling Air suspension
The Coupé comes with the option of AIRMATIC air suspension on the front and rear axle. Its electronically controlled, continuously adjustable damping on the front and rear axle ensures outstanding road roar and tyre vibration characteristics in every situation and gives the driver the option of selecting the desired driving style: sporty, comfortable or consumption-optimised. To this end, the driver can select one of five driving modes using the DYNAMIC SELECT Switch: ""ECO"", ""Comfort"", ""Sport"", ""Sport +"" and ""Individual"". Selecting ""Individual"" allows the driver to customise the vehicle settings. AIRMATIC also features all-round self-levelling for excellent ride comfort even with the vehicle loaded. Efficient and lively engines
Powerful and efficient four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines with ECO start/stop function provide for sporty performance and driving pleasure. All are compliant with the Euro 6 emissions standard. Compared with the predecessor they consume up to 20 percent less fuel. There are initially four petrol engines available for the Coupé. The power spectrum ranges from the 1.6-litre four-cylinder engine in the C 180 with 115 kW/156 hp to the two-litre C 200 (135 kW/184 hp) and C 250 (155 kW/211 hp) models and the C 300, likewise with a displacement of two litres but with an output of 180 kW/245 hp. The two diesel models are equipped with an enhanced four-cylinder unit developing 125 kW (170 hp) or 150 kW (204 hp) and feature ecofriendly SCR technology (Selective Catalytic Reduction) for exhaust gas aftertreatment. Lighter, stiffer and stronger
Intelligent lightweight construction with a higher proportion of aluminium helps make the Coupé lighter than its predecessor. Light-alloy components include the wings, bonnet and boot lid. At the same time, the body is now much stiffer and stronger thanks to the use of high-strength materials, which has a positive effect on not only driving dynamics and noise levels but also crash safety. The Coupé therefore follows a Mercedes-Benz tradition in not only meeting all current national and international laws, but also all rating requirements as well as the more stringent internal Mercedes-Benz safety requirements, which are based on what actually happens in real-life accidents. Through the wind
Mercedes-Benz is setting the pace in the field of aerodynamics and delivers cars with the best drag coefficients (Cd values) in almost all vehicle classes. The new C‑Class Coupé boasts a Cd value of 0.26. This leading figure pays off above all when driving on country roads and motorways as wind resistance is greater than other forms of driving resistance at speeds above 70 km/h. Safe semi-autonomous driving to reduce stress
There are several safety and assistance systems based on the Mercedes-Benz Intelligent Drive concept to choose from. ATTENTION ASSIST with adjustable sensitivity, which can warn the driver of inattentiveness and drowsiness, is included as standard. Further standard equipment includes COLLISION PREVENTION ASSIST PLUS, which features an acoustic warning for the driver at speeds above 7 km/h and Adaptive Brake Assist to help avoid collisions by boosting the braking effect in line with the current situation. When a danger of collision persists and the driver fails to respond, the system is able to carry out autonomous braking at speeds of up to 200 km/h, thereby reducing the severity of collisions with slower or stopping vehicles or, in the best-case scenario, even avoiding the collision altogether. At speeds of up to 50 km/h the system also brakes in response to stationary vehicles, and is thus able to help prevent rear-end collisions at up to 40 km/h. New assistance systems with substantially enhanced functions are optionally available, combining data from various sensor technologies such as radar sensors and a stereo camera as part of the Intelligent Drive concept to enhance comfort and safety:
DISTRONIC PLUS with Steering Assist and Stop&Go Pilot is an adaptive cruise control system that can adjust the speed of the vehicle in line with a slower-moving vehicle ahead in a speed range from 0 to 200 km/h if required. Likewise available from 0 to 200 km/h, steering intervention helps the driver stay in lane. And at speeds below 130 km/h, for example in traffic jams or when driving bumper to bumper, the system can follow the vehicle ahead even where there are no or unclear lane markings, thus enabling the driver to safety and comfortably follow the flow of traffic. As well as vehicles ahead and stationary vehicles, the BAS PLUS Brake Assist System can also detect crossing traffic and boost the braking force if the driver fails to apply the brakes sufficiently; in addition to slower-moving, stopping and stationary vehicles, the PRE-SAFE® Brake can even detect pedestrians and brake autonomously if the driver fails to react, thus preventing accidents up to 50 km/h and mitigating the severity of collisions at speeds of up to 72 km/h. In flowing traffic the PRE-SAFE® Brake provides assistance according to the same mode of operation throughout the speed range from 7 to 200 km/h. Enhanced Active Lane Keeping Assist can now also prevent the vehicle from unintentionally drifting out of lane by applying the brakes on one side when the lane markings are solid or broken and there is a risk of collision, e.g. as a result of vehicles overtaking at high speed, parallel traffic or even oncoming traffic. PRE-SAFE® PLUS extends the Intelligent Drive functions to take account of imminent rear impacts. It warns the following traffic by activating the rear hazard warning lights at increased frequency and initiating preventive PRE‑SAFE® occupant protection measures such as the reversible belt tensioner immediately prior to the impact. If the vehicle is stationary, the brakes are locked to reduce the forward jolt, which reduces the forces acting on the occupants and the risk of secondary collisions. The numerous assistance systems also include
Active Parking Assist, which enables semi-automated parking with active steering and brake intervention in both parallel and end-on parking spaces A 360° camera which is able to show the vehicle and its surroundings from various perspectives, including a virtual bird's-eye view, thus assisting with parking and manoeuvring Camera and navigation-based Traffic Sign Assist with wrong-way warning function, which warns of speed limits and also alerts the driver to the start and end of no-overtaking zones and gives the driver a visual and audible warning if no-entry signs are detected Adaptive Highbeam Assist Plus, which allows the high-beam headlamps to be kept on permanently without dazzling traffic by masking out other vehicles in the cone of light from the high-beam headlamps Airbags for safety
In addition to 3-point seat belts with pyrotechnical belt tensioning and belt-force limitation for driver, front passenger and rear passengers, numerous airbags serve to protect the vehicle's occupants in an accident. These include:
Frontal protection systems: Adaptive front airbags for driver and front passenger, additionally with a kneebag on the driver's side Side protection systems: Thorax/pelvisbags for driver and front passenger plus front and rear windowbags, with rear sidebags available as an option Climate control with satellite navigation
The air conditioning system in the new C-Class Coupé operates efficiently and ensures high air quality. As in the Saloon, it uses satellite navigation to detect tunnels. It therefore closes the air recirculation flap automatically when entering a tunnel and opens it again after exiting a tunnel. Vibrant infotainment experience
The new multimedia generation offers intuitive controls with visual animations and effects. Frontbass ensures a listening experience almost on a par with a concert hall – especially if the optionally available Burmester® sound system is specified. The Frontbass system uses the space within the cross-member and side member in the body structure as a resonance chamber for the bass speakers. The navigation system, which supplies the driver with precise traffic information in real time (Live Traffic Information), processes its contents interactively. Its features include an animated compass, a ""Drive Show"" with information for passengers similar to the on-screen presentations on board airliners and Google Maps displayed on the head unit. Extensive networking even in the basic version
A Bluetooth®-compatible mobile phone with data option is all it takes to make even the Audio 20 system internet-capable. This enables surfing the internet without restrictions when the vehicle is stationary. Mercedes-Benz Apps can be used while driving. Audio and video playback is possible from various sources. COMAND Online provides not only a larger display with a resolution of 960 x 540 pixels, it also allows digital TV/radio reception and, in addition to many other features, offers fast hard-disc navigation, integral WLAN hotspot functionality and the LINGUATRONIC voice control system. The basic Audio 20 system as well as Audio 20 CD and COMAND Online all offer basic telephony as standard, which links up a mobile phone to the vehicle via a standardised Bluetooth® interface. Mercedes connect me: connected with the car
Like other models, the new C-Class Coupé has an extensive range of free Standard Services and Remote Online Services available as part of the ""Mercedes connect me"" package. Standard Services include automatic emergency call (eCall), Accident Recovery, breakdown assistance and after-sales service. The Remote Online services (standard with COMAND online and usable free of charge for the first three years) allow access to vehicle information at all times, including the status of windows and doors, mileage, tyre pressures and other diagnostic data. There is also a Vehicle Tracker function, remote door locking and unlocking, and remote auxiliary heating activation and deactivation.",1746cde7-2075-4809-8982-fa3b4c26d551,Blog,2015-08-31T23:23:44Z,uautoknow.net,Mercedes Benz debuts sleek new C-Class Coupe - w/videos,1.0,News

3699,"David de Gea's transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid has stalled due to a delay over the paperwork. 

La Liga said it had not received the relevant documents for the agreement by its deadline of midnight on 31 August.

Real and United agreed a deal of £29m, a figure which included goalkeeper Keylor Navas going in the opposite direction in exchange for De Gea.

Manchester United told Sky Sports News they signed and sent all relevant documentation on time - and they have the evidence to prove it.

And Real Madrid and United may consider an appeal over the likely cause of the delay, which may include a computer glitch.

Spanish football expert Guillem Balague told Sky Sports News: ""La Liga has confirmed that the documents have not reached them on time and, as it stands, the transfer is not going to take place.

""Everything was done and everyone was waiting. David de Gea was at his girlfriend's house in Madrid, [Real Madrid president] Florentino Perez was at the Santiago Bernabeu.

""Navas was there too and was waiting to pass a medical, and everything was signed and sent to Manchester.

""But the information is that the documentation didn't come back from Manchester United on time.

""Reports say the Navas paperwork came in at one minute past midnight in Spain and therefore did not reach La Liga on time, so the transfer is not going to happen.

""There is no precedent for this. Three years ago Fabio Coentrao could not go to Manchester United for the exact same reason, and Real asked the league if they could have five more minutes, and the league said 'no'.",bb9c4761-1fa3-4395-abc3-3a8d71b208db,News,2015-09-01T05:00:54Z,Heart Radio,De Gea's Move To Real Madrid Stalls,0.0,News

BRI Nutrition's Top Rated Extra Strength Garlic Leaves Customers Burpless and Sends 5 Star Reviews Soaring 

“Although one of the contributing factors to our brands success is that our products are 100% safe and natural with no fillers or artificial ingredients, our Top Rated Extra Strength Garlic was created to be a burpless garlic supplement that delivers maximum strength and maximum benefits.” - BRI Nutrition CEO, Brendan Morris 

September 8, 2015 (San Francisco Bay Area, California)  — BRI Nutrition’s ( http://brinutrition.com ) Top Rated Extra Strength Garlic recently received its 100th 5-star review on Amazon.com now making it another one of BRI's numerable 100+ 5 Star health nutrition supplements. BRI Nutrition debuted their Top Rated Extra Strength Garlic on Amazon.com in late 2014. The product has quickly ranked with more than 100 5 Star Reviews from customers sharing both facts and opinions on the ability of the product. 

""Unlike a variety of garlic supplements on today's market, BRI Nutrition's Top Rated Garlic is a 1000mg pure & maximum strength potency Garlic Allium Sativum supplement made in an American GMP/FDA facility,"" said BRI Nutrition CEO, Brendan Morris. Morris added that, ""Although one of the contributing factors to our brand’s success is that our products are 100% safe and natural with no fillers or artificial ingredients. In addition, our Top Rated Extra Strength Garlic was created to be a burpless garlic supplement that delivers maximum strength and maximum benefits. That has certainly played a role in making it a customer favorite."" 

In February 2015, Verified Purchaser, Nunya , is quoted as saying, ""A lot of people including myself want to take a garlic supplement because of its many health benefits. The problem is many garlic supplements leave you tasting garlic and smelling like you rolled in a bed of garlic cloves. This pure and potent garlic supplement from BRI nutrition is odorless, tasteless and has zero aftertaste. It makes me feel good knowing it is made in the USA with no fillers or artificial ingredients. The smaller than pea size soft gels are easy to swallow and don't leave me burping garlic the rest of the day. I get all of the cardiovascular benefits without having to worry about being stinky.""

2336,"By The Hollywood star and aspiring actress dated on/off from 2012 and split again just days before she killed herself         Get daily news by email         Jim Carrey and Cathriona White      
 Jim Carrey was a huge support to girlfriend Cathriona White when they first got together as she was grieving the loss of her father. 
 
The Hollywood star and aspiring actress started dating in 2012 and the new couple were seen on holiday together around the time she flew back to her native Ireland for her dad's funeral. 
 
A source exclusively told Mirror Celeb: ""Her father suffered from a long-term illness and Jim was Cathriona's rock when he passed away."" 
 
The 53-year-old star has now been left heartbroken, along with her family, after she took her own life. 
 
 Cathriona White, Jim Carrey May 18, 2015 
 
The couple first met in late summer 2012, but by March the following year they had split. 
 
They kept in constant touch as friends before rekindling their romance in May this year and split just days before Cathriona was found dead . 
 
Our source continued: ""Cathriona's family are fiercely protective, as are the people in Cappaghwhite, the small village where she is from, and everyone was extremely proud of her. They are normal country people. 
 
""Cathriona had been mad about Jim since she met him and was thrilled when they got back together earlier this year. 
 
  Splash   Jim Carrey and Cathriona White 
 
""Jim loves Ireland and loved Tipperary, showing his support for it recently by wearing the local hurling jersey."" 
 
It is thought they made a secret trip to Ireland to meet her family earlier this year and they recently visited Canada together. 
 
""Cathriona and Jim were both into the outdoors and keeping fit,"" our source added. 
 
""They cycled and mountain climbed together and she spent most of her time at his house. 
 
  Getty   Actor Jim Carrey 
 
""They were really into healthy eating – she wasn't much of a party girl and was happy to live a low key life with Jim out of the limelight, something he also wanted."" 
 
Cathriona, 28, doted on her nephews and nieces in Tipperary and missed them terribly while away in Los Angeles, trying to get back home as often as possible. 
 
Seven weeks ago, Cathriona's older sister Lisa and her husband John Aherne had travelled out to Los Angeles to spend some time with her. 
 
Her funeral is expected to take place in her native Tipperary once arrangements are made.

* President says limit to Germany's ability to take refugees 
 
* Government defends handling of record influx 
 
* 14 injured after refugees fight at reception center

 (Adds German government reaction) 
 
By Keith Weir 
   
BERLIN, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Germany's president has warned
that there are limits to how many refugees his country can
absorb as it prepares for as many as 800,000 arrivals this year,
showing growing concern even at the highest level over how to
look after so many newcomers. 
 
""We want to help. We have a big heart. However, there is a
limit to what we can do,"" President Joachim Gauck, a former
rights activist in communist East Germany, said in a speech on
Sunday evening. 
 
""Our ability to take in people is limited, although we don't
know yet where those limits are,"" he added. 
 
The comments from the head of state, who has a largely
ceremonial role but whose words carry moral authority, appeared
to be striking a more cautious tone than Chancellor Angela
Merkel who has said Germany can cope with the record influx. 
 
The government declined to respond directly to Gauck's
comments, reflecting political convention, but defended its
handling of the situation. 
 
""The German government and the chancellor are convinced that
protection has to be given to those who need it, whether they
are persecuted for political reasons or fleeing war,"" said
government spokesman Steffen Seibert. 
 
The debate came amid signs of growing tension among asylum
seekers, part of a wave of mass migration into the European
Union from the Middle East and parts of Africa. 
 
Fourteen people were injured on Sunday when a brawl broke
out between two rival groups in a refugee center in the western
German town of Calden, police said. The refugees were being
housed in tents set up on a disused airfield. 
 
A union representing German police officers has suggested
that refugees should be divided according to their religion to
try to reduce the risk of conflict. 
 
Germany has reintroduced border controls with EU neighbors
to try to regulate the flow of people after initially throwing
open its doors to refugees from Syria. 
 
The central government also agreed last week to give its 16
regional states around 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) next year
to help cover the cost of looking after refugees. 
 
""The German government stands by its decision to now
introduce signs of order into the process for the arrival and
the admission of refugees,"" Seibert added. 
 
Merkel's popularity has dropped sharply over her handling of
the refugee crisis, two polls showed at the weekend, indicating
a shift in the mood in the Europe Union's most populous country.

September 19, 2015 On to Carrion de Los Condos The walk was about half at the riversides of the Rio Ucieza which was beautiful and quiet. The other was on a path beside the road. It was a challenge to find the divergent path and in the beginning one had to have faith that we were on the right trail. About half way through the walk we visited the Santa Maria la Virgin Blanc church which was built by the Knights Templar in the 12 century. We arrived in Carrion requiring a beer to quench our thirst. It was a pleasant day discovering the town of 2200 people. It was once 10,000 strong. We attended a beautiful concert at the church followed by mass. We received the Pilgrams Blessing which was moving. The nuns provided a star to help us find our way. Almost half way there!!!!!

(TSX: DNA)(TSX: DNA.WT)(AIM: DALR) (""Dalradian"" or the ""Company"") announced a downsizing and restructuring of the Company's management team and corporate office relocation. These changes are expected to result in annual savings of nearly 20% to the Company's general and administrative costs. 

Tim Warman, President and Ruth Ives, VP Project Management, have left Dalradian, effective immediately. Their responsibilities have been assumed by Eric Tremblay, Dalradian's Chief Operating Officer (COO) and Patrick F. N. Anderson, Chief Executive Officer (CEO). In addition, Keith McKay, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), will be retiring during 2016 once a replacement has been found and a transition period is complete. 

Dalradian's corporate office has been downsized and moved to a location further away from the financial centre in Toronto, cutting the annual lease approximately in half. 

Patrick F.N. Anderson, Dalradian's Chairman and CEO, commented: 

""These changes show our commitment to becoming an even more streamlined development company and also reflect our understanding of the current market realities of our industry. These initiatives are part of our ongoing drive to effectively preserve and deploy our cash while continuing to move our high-grade Curraghinalt gold project toward production. I would like to thank Tim and Ruth for their contributions to Curraghinalt's growth and development and wish them all the best in their future endeavours. Our COO has been in place since March of this year and is well-positioned to take over their responsibilities, some of which he had assumed several months ago. Our CFO, Keith McKay, has been with us since the founding of the Company and we appreciate his willingness to extend his tenure in order to ensure a smooth transition.""

18,"The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department said it was a matter of public safety when deputies opened fire from a helicopter on a wrong-way chase suspect on the 215 Freeway. 
On Friday, a suspect led authorities on a dangerous high-speed chase through surface streets in Fontana and San Bernardino before he drove the wrong way in the northbound lanes of the freeway. He reached speeds as high as 100 mph and deputies deemed him a threat to public safety. 

Lt. Mitch Datillo said there is a lot for deputies to take into account before firing from a helicopter. 

""If you're near schools, if you're in residential areas. We have had times where we fully intended that it was getting to that level and we could not deploy, based on the backdrop and the public safety there,"" he said. 

But when the suspect jumped out of his SUV after being shot, the car continued to move and slammed head-on into another SUV, injuring three people. A relative of that family told Eyewitness News that he questions the decision by deputies to open fire from the air. 

While shooting from a helicopter is rare, it does happen. In 2004, a deputy with the Orange County Sheriff's Department opened fire from their helicopter on a suspect who was firing at deputies at a recycling plant near Irvine. 

Eyewitness News spoke with use-of-force expert and Inyo County Sheriff's Deputy Ed. Obayashi, who said he agrees with the decision to shoot, based partly on the fact of the suspect's speed while heading in the wrong direction on the freeway. 

""It could have been worse,"" he said. ""That constitutes an immediate grave danger to the public and that justifies deadly force.""

3212,"British anti-doping chiefs could contact French prosecutors to see if their doping investigation involves players who might be competing in the Rugby World Cup. British anti-doping chiefs could contact French prosecutors to see if their doping investigation involves players who might be competing in the Rugby World Cup. Nicole Sapstead, the chief executive of the national anti-doping agency UKAD, told UK MPs: ""We have sufficient and excellent links with Interpol, Europol and our police where we can start to ask them for that kind of information and expect some reciprocal exchange of information.

""If there was any player that we felt was pulled into that issue then we would certainly be looking into it.""

UKAD is running the anti-doping programme for the Rugby World Cup, which starts in the UK on September 18.

Ms Sapstead's comments to the Culture, Media and Sport select committee came after Marseille prosecutors launched an investigation into several pharmacies in Toulon. It follows a notification from France's anti-doping authority Agence Francaise de Lutte contre le Dopage (AFDL).

Reports in France alleged Toulon players had been supplied with anabolic steroids but Toulon owner Mourad Boudjellal has angrily denied allegations of doping made against the triple European champions.

Ms Sapstead said World Cup players can expect ""one of the most comprehensive testing programmes the tournament has seen so far"", adding: ""The last thing a huge tournament like this wants is a doping scandal.""

Ms Sapstead told the MPs that players could be tested in the UK.

She said: ""We certainly would be engaging with world rugby to decide about a testing programme for sure, absolutely.

""They are doing a comprehensive programme not just of in-competition or post-competition testing, they are doing some very extensive pre-competition testing.

""When you live in the world that we do, that is where your risk window is. It is prior to a competition.""

Mr Boudjellal, a billionaire comic book magnate insists the investigation is solely centred around social security fraud and one pharmacist, not Toulon.

He has told reporters in France: ""No player is concerned in this affair, it's totally unfounded information.

""This is related to a social security fraud; that concerns the pharmacist not RCT.""

1651,"DeKALB – Northern Illinois University trustees Thursday approved a $389 million interim budget, and the school anticipates a large loss of state funding. 
   
The budget, down 8.7 percent from last year’s $426 million spending plan, will be in effect for at least a month, but could last until the next scheduled Board of Trustees meeting Dec. 10. NIU officials hope that by then the state has adopted a budget so the school can finalize its financial plan. 

“In most years we [NIU] would have a budget by July 1, but we don’t,” NIU President Doug Baker said. “We don’t have a state budget by July 1. So when we put this together, we had to put it together with our best estimates of what our revenues are going to be.” 

The budget estimates the university will lose $27.2 million in state funding this fiscal year, which ends June 30. It anticipates $63.9 million in general state aid, down from $91.1 million last year. 

University officials said they want to hold off making any moves that affect staffing, but the budget approved Thursday has a $29.8 million gap between revenue and operating expenses, according to university data. 

Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner in May vetoed a Democrat-backed budget plan that included appropriations for all of the state’s nine public universities. That budget called for an 8 percent state funding cut. Rauner has proposed cutting state funding for higher education aid by 30 percent. 

The difference between Democrats’ proposal and Rauner’s is about $22 million, NIU Vice President of Administration and Finance Alan Phillips said. 

“We do not have any idea what our appropriation will be from the state,” Phillips said. “You can’t make any firm decisions on spending until you know what your budget is actually going to be.” 

The governor and Democrat-led General Assembly remain at loggerheads as the state has moved into its third month without a budget. Without the state spending plan, NIU is among the legion of entities left in financial limbo wondering how much it will be appropriated. 

“These are unprecedented cuts,” NIU Trustee John Butler, the board’s vice chairman, said. 

Trustees expressed concern Thursday that the interim budget could push the university into deficit spending. The $389.4 million plan it approved was $29.9 million less than its expected operating expenses. 

The Academic Affairs department had the greatest expenses, according to budget information presented to trustees. The department, which includes the colleges of business, education and law, as well as libraries and NIU’s graduate school, expects to spend $189.3 million, more than double that of Student Affairs, which handles student services such as housing and admissions. 
 
NIU is the largest employer in DeKalb County. The school, Illinois’ third largest public university, has a staff of more than 1,100 faculty and more than 3,400 nonfaculty workers. Phillips said that if the school doesn’t know by year-end what state money it will receive – and actually start to have it roll in – there could be furloughs or layoffs. 

“We’re in process of cutting back in areas that we can, short of personnel,” Phillips said. “The last thing we want to do is cut personnel.” 

In the previous fiscal year, NIU made 161 hires, including its first diversity chief. Vernese Edghill-Walden started Aug. 3 with a base salary of $185,000. The university also lost 389 employees to retirement and terminations, according to NIU spokesman Joe King. 

The university’s payroll includes Baker’s $450,000 base salary. Football coach Rod Carey makes just less than Baker’s salary at $408,000, with his boss, Associate Vice President and Athletic Director Sean Frazier at $280,000. 

This summer, several NIU staffers decided to unionize. Most of those employees looking to join the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees earn less than $50,000, according to NIU data. The school cited budget constraint for not giving them raises. 

General state aid payments will stop coming in after this week, when Phillips said NIU received its final fiscal 2015 disbursement. 

That approximately $8 million payout could be the last of the checks cut to the school until a new budget is in place. 

But there were bright sides to be considered, NIU Trustee Cherilyn Murer said, pointing out that the school needs to start moving away from dependence on general state aid, which represents about 20 percent of its budget. Murer suggested increasing research to help forge more corporate partnerships. 

This year’s budget plan calls for spending $4.8 million on research and partnerships. 

“Only with optimism do we have growth,” Murer said. “If we’re looking at things in too dismal a fashion, we will become paralyzed. And that will be the downfall of the univ",3d7514c2-8b6e-4b60-8417-84b580417efc,News,2015-09-18T05:12:00Z,Daily Chronicle,NIU trustees approve interim budget,0.0,News

1541,"NOVANEWS    Obama turned down a request from  Jordan  for Predator spy drones that would help it locate targets in the war against Saudi Zio-Wahhabi ‘ISIS’.    

 
Jordan’s Zionist puppet Abdullah II and his master Zionist Benjamin Naziyahu 
 Washington Times   The refusal, disclosed by a House Armed Services Committee member, has gained attention since  Jordan  has emerged as a critical player in a U.S.-led coalition to destroy Syria.  

 Members of Congress  called on the White House to approve a list of weapons for CIA Zionist puppet of Jordan, “The decision to deny the request should be reversed immediately,”  Mr. Hunter  wrote. “Doing so will provide  Jordan  critical mission capability in the fight against the Islamic State and ensure  Jordan  is given every advantage.  The Arab Daily News   In another sign of the increased cooperation and strategic military alliance between the Nazi regime of I$raHell and CIA puppet of Jordan, news reports said that the Nazi regime will supply Jordan with two types of drones to help Jordan ”fight the Islamic State in Iraq, ISIS”.  

 The London based Jane’s Defense magazine which reported the news earlier this week based on Zionist news sources said that Zionist regime will supply Jordan with 12 “Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) Heron TP strategic and Elbit Systems Skylark tactical UAVs.”  The Heron TP is the largest and most sophisticated UAV in service since entering the Nazi army in 2010. The drone can fly to an altitude of 45,000 feet and stay there for up to 40 hours if necessary.  Nazi regime has been helping Jordan in its fight against Assad government by supplying its Puppet and strategic ally with high tech weapons to protect its borders against the ”terrorist group”.  

 
The Heron TP (Eitan) UAV is designed to fly at high altitude on missions spanning over several days. This HALE (High Altitude Long Endurance) UAV has a wingspan of a Boeing 737 and weighs 4.5 tons; and of that, 1,000 Kg is payload. The Eitan, derived from the `Heron’ MALE (Medium Altitude Long Endurance) platform, was developed by Nazi Aerospace Industry (IAI). 
 Nazi defense website reported last week that a joint Jordanian-I$raHell command and control war room is currently leading the air campaign against ‘ISIS’ from a base in northern Jordan.  Sources in the Pentagon, however, who did not wish to be identified for this story told the Arab Daily News that the Nazi drones will help Jordanian Special Forces currently fighting ‘ISIS’ in Iraq and supporting the US troops on the ground there. A total of 12 Nazi-made UAVs will be delivered to Zionist puppet of Jordan in the near future.  

 
Jordanian and Nazi flags fly side by side at Peace Park 
 Images  seen online on August 13 also showed Royal Jordanian Air Force Lockheed Martin F-16 Fighting Falcons parked next to Nazi Air Force Boeing F-151 Eagle (Ra’am) fighters at Lajes Field in the Azores on their way to the United States for joint exercises, accompanied by a group of Nazi Air Force KC-707 fuel tankers.  Also last month,  with its retired Cobra helicopters after the US performed the necessary overhaul and updates. The Arab Daily News also reported that Nazi fuel tankers refueled Jordanian F16s Mid Air on their way to the US to participate along with Nazi F15s in Red Flag military exercise at Nellis Air Force Base North of Las Vegas Nevada.

Cheered by a throng of 11,000 on the South Lawn of the White House, Francis touched on immigration and climate change -- issues where he agrees with Democrats -- but also religious liberty and marriage, where he sides with Republicans. 

""I look forward to these days of encounter and dialogue in which I hope to listen to and share many of the hopes and dreams of the American people,"" Francis said in his first remarks of a six-day trip that will also take him to New York City and Philadelphia. 

In addition to the flourish of a White House welcome, Francis spent Wednesday parading through parts of the city, holding a prayer service with U.S. bishops and canonizing a new saint at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. He mingled with the crowd and hugged children outside his temporary residence at the Vatican Embassy. 

It was a busy start to the first U.S. visit of the Argentine pope's life. Known for his unusual humility, the pope even made a statement with his transportation choices. Francis eschewed luxury brands as he arrived at the White House in a compact Fiat, and he later blessed parade crowds from a customized Jeep Wrangler popemobile. 

Thursday he will address Congress, a first for any pope, but he did not wait to delve into the political issues that have divided the nation. 

The pontiff and politics 

Speaking in English, not his native tongue, Francis told President Barack Obama: ""I find it encouraging that you are proposing an initiative for reducing air pollution."" It was a reference to Obama's policies through the Environmental Protection Agency, which have drawn heated criticism from conservatives and industry. 

The pope this year issued an encyclical, Laudato Si, on the threat of climate change, urging nations to act to save the planet. Most Republicans in Congress reject plans to mandate emissions reductions for fear of stifling the economy, and many insist that climate change, if it's happening, is not the fault of humans. 

As Republican presidential hopefuls debate whether to keep ""birthright citizenship"" for people born to immigrants here illegally, Francis referenced his own upbringing. 

""As a son of an immigrant family, I am happy to be a guest in this country, which was largely built by such families,"" he said. 

But lest Obama and his fellow Democrats get too comfortable, Francis also more obliquely mentioned issues on which they disagree. 

The Obama administration and the Catholic Church have sparred in court over the mandate that health insurance plans under Obamacare cover contraceptives. Catholic organizations and other companies and groups have said they should not be forced to pay for services to which they have a religious objection. 

""With countless other people of goodwill, (American Catholics) are likewise concerned that efforts to build a just and wisely ordered society respect their deepest concerns and the right to religious liberty,"" Francis said. 

Obama, speaking before Francis, gave a defense of religious liberty as a founding principle of the nation. 

The issue of religious liberty was raised anew after the U.S. Supreme Court this year legalized same-sex marriage throughout the nation, raising concerns that some Christians could be persecuted for disagreeing with the practice. The issue has raged from the presidential campaign trail to Congress to Atlanta's Gold Dome, where religious liberty bills have sparked conflict between conservative activists and big business in Georgia. 

Francis used the type of language Christian conservatives have used to criticize the court without directly doing so. He mentioned his Philadelphia appearance at the World Meeting of Families to ""celebrate and support the institutions of marriage and the family at this critical moment in the history of our civilization."" 

Obama lavished his guest with praise for his ""humility, your embrace of simplicity, the gentleness of your words and the generosity of your spirit."" 

The two met one-on-one for 40 minutes in the Oval Office, a meeting the White House later described as focusing on areas of agreement, such as fighting poverty, opening relations with Cuba and accepting refugees. Obama presented Francis a sculpture of an ascending dove -- a symbol of peace and the Holy Spirit -- and a key from the Maryland home of Elizabeth Ann Seton, the first U.S.-born saint. 

'Generous commitment' to healing 

At the meeting with American bishops, Francis addressed the open wound of the priest sex abuse scandal that has rocked the church in the U.S. and worldwide, but he had a positive message. 

The pope lauded the bishops' ""generous commitment to bring healing to victims."" He praised them for having courage and acting, as he saw it, ""without fear of self-criticism."" 

The remarks drew criticism from a prominent group of victims of abuse. 

""His remarks today confirm what we've long said and suspected: This pope, like his predecessors, is doing and will do little if anything to bring real reform to this continuing crisis,"" said Barbara Blaine, the president of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests. ""Those who care about kids must focus on secular authorities, not church figures (however popular they may be)."" 

At the basilica, Francis canonized a new saint, Junipero Serra, another controversial move. A Spanish missionary, Serra introduced Christianity to California in the 18th century, but Native Americans claim the brutality of the colonists is hardly deserving of sainthood. 

Crowds pour out for pope 

Still, everywhere he went through the city, Francis was greeted by adoring crowds. 

The White House ceremony was stocked with dignitaries of many faiths. U.S. Reps. Buddy Carter, a Pooler Republican, and Rick Allen, an Evans Republican, were among them. 

Carter, a Methodist, was careful to say his appearance at the White House was not necessarily an endorsement of what the pope might say there or in Congress. 

""I'm obviously interested in his views,"" Carter said. ""He represents a lot of people. But at the same time, I'm here more out of respect than anything."" 

When talking about climate change, Francis referenced one of Atlanta's most famous citizens. 

""To use a telling phrase of the Reverend Martin Luther King, we can say that we have defaulted on a promissory note, and now is the time to honor it,"" the pope said. 

King's daughter Bernice, the head of the King Center, was on hand for the moment. 

""I was deeply moved,"" King said in a written statement, ""to hear Pope Francis quote my father's words and invoke his name.""

I'm no hypocrite. But I'm sick of seeing my posts that way too. If you've noticed, I've been trying to change my blogging style. More genuine, less cheese(to no cheese, even in real life I don't eat cheese) I'm in no position to criticize other bloggers so the only person I can push is myself. So last month, ELF Philippines sent me over their Eyebrow Doctor box filled with different products from brow pencils, brow powders, primers, and brow stencils to try. Ang dami no? Thank you ELF Philippines. I like multi-purpose makeup so I decided to use and feature their Eyebrow Lifter and Filler.  It's a dual-tip eyepencil with built-in sharpener One side is for highlighting. It is in light beige color The other side is for shading and filling in. It is in taupe brown color. My bare brows. I had these shaped at Benefit Brow Bar. The pencil is hard, and just gives off the right amount of pigment to fill in the brows without looking fake. I prefer brow pencils that is hard. The Elf Eyebrow Lifter and Filler reminds me of Shu Uemura's hard pencils. These are my brows are filling them in, and highlighting the under brows. Looks natural no? And it's pretty cheap! They didn't indicate the price but ELF products like this costs less than 200 pesos and can be bought at any SM Beauty located in SM Department Stores. I have LOADS of eyebrow products in my stash so I doubt I'll be repurchasing this really soon but this pencil isn't too shabby at all. It's quite nice. I like it. :) ELF Philippines Website: http://www.eyeslipsface.ph/ I hope you enjoyed this post as much as I did writing it!

9557,"I’m back from Graph Expo, and when I let me brain rest, it’s interesting what rises to the top. One of those things was a comment made by Niels M. Winther in the Executive Outlook on Sunday morning. The auditorium was packed, not just because it was the opening session, but because of who was speaking and why. Niels has been a powerhouse in this industry for a long time — on the vendor side. He’s been the president or CEO of Heidelberg USA, Baumfolder, and the East Asiatic Company, and he has served on the board of directors for dozens of other companies. But then he did something unexpected. He jumped the fence and became a printer. Today, Niels is co-owner of ThinkPatented in Miamisburg, OH. What on earth was he going to say? A lot, it turns out, and it’s not what most of the audience wanted to hear. Niels reinforced the trend we’re hearing more and more, which is that for companies to succeed, printing has to be seen as a tool, not as the “end all, be all” of profitability. It is interesting that ThinkPatented doesn’t refer to itself as a “marketing services provider.” It refers to itself as a marketing execution company. To summarize in my own words, “value-added services” is a misnomer. It’s not about adding value to print because that continues to make print the focus. It’s about viewing the communications process as a whole and understanding where and how to plug in the different components as a means to an end. Often that will include print, but sometimes it won’t. It’s about accomplishing some kind of result, whether it includes print or not. This is, in essence, the heart of what Niels said, and he was shockingly frank when one of the members of the audience asked what percentage of the salespeople understood and were on board. His answer? “Eighty percent of my salespeople don’t get it, and they never will.” He went on to explain that while these salespeople are valued members of the ThinkPatented team, over time, they will move on through attrition, and when ThinkPatented hires, it will often be from outside the industry. “Our salespeople don’t need to know how to put dots on dots,” he said. “We can teach them that. They need to know how to sell it.” This is something I saw repeatedly throughout the show. Printers who truly “get it” bringing in talent from outside the industry or fresh out of college or training programs, where they can learn to think and sell the way the industry is moving. Because like it or not, you can’t always teach an established dog new tricks.",4e6c7e22-abc6-4d90-b39c-8b3430398118,Blog,2015-09-17T13:00:22Z,The Digital Nirvana,“80% of My Sales People Will Never Get It”,1.0,Blog

2 arrested while 2 policemen were injured in rally, say cops BY MUZLIZA MUSTAFA Published: 16 September 2015 10:11 PM The Federal Reserve Unit guards the entrance to Petaling Street as 'red shirt' rally-goers try to break through the barricades. – The Malaysian Insider pic by Afif Abd Halim, September 16, 2015. The situation in the capital city of Kuala Lumpur was under control despite a 'minor' incident earlier today at Petaling Street when the 'red shirt' rally-goers attempted to breach the barricade, Kuala Lumpur police chief Datuk Tajuddin Md Isa said. He said two rally-goers were detained for abetting in an assault while two policemen were injured when the crowd attempted to break through the barricade. ""There was a commotion in the area but police managed to control the situation,"" Tajuddin said, adding that an estimated 35,000 people took part in the rally. ""As of 8pm, the situation in Kuala Lumpur remains under control and rally-goers are slowly dispersing from the scene. We will continue to monitor the situation in the city to ensure the safety and security of the general public."" Earlier, the situation in Petaling Street, or Chinatown turned chaotic, when the rally-goers tried to break through the barricades.

3351,"There are no shortcuts to Scottish independence and it will not happen just because supporters become ""more impatient for change"", Scotland's First Minister has said. 

Nicola Sturgeon said ruling out another referendum indefinitely would be wrong but she indicated that winning a second vote would not happen imminently because the concerns of those who voted No must be addressed ""patiently, carefully and comprehensively"". 

She said she respected the result of last year's historic ballot, which saw Scotland vote to remain part of the UK.

Exactly a year after that poll, she told David Cameron he is ""living on borrowed time"" as she spoke about the prospect of a second referendum.

While the Prime Minister said it was ""time to move on"" from last year's ballot, promising action to ensure the Scottish Parliament is a permanent part of the UK's political landscape, Ms Sturgeon told an audience in Edinburgh: ""We respect last year's result. 

""It would be wrong to propose another referendum without a fundamental change of circumstances or a strong indication that a significant number of those who voted No last year had changed their minds.

""If we are to win independence, we must convince a majority of Scots that it represents the best future for Scotland. 

""That was true last year, it is true now and it will be true at all times in the future. There are no shortcuts. 

""Independence won't happen just because its supporters become more impatient for change. An even more committed, enthusiastic and impatient 45% is still just 45%. 

""If Scotland is to become independent, we must build the support for independence. 

""Just as in the referendum campaign, it grew from 30% to 45%, we must in the years ahead take it from 45% to a clear majority.

LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - If Verizon's new mobile video service go90 succeeds in grabbing the attention of millenials who increasingly watch content on mobile devices, a streaming option for TVs could be next. 
 
Verizon Communications Inc, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, launched a trial of its free, ad-supported mobile video product, an app that offers live events, on-demand shows and Web videos, on Tuesday. 
 
Companies such as Netflix Inc and Hulu that offer Web-based video services have put pressure on traditional pay-TV companies that are struggling to add viewers. 
 
With go90, Verizon, which also offers a separate pay-TV service through its FiOS unit, has taken a different approach by introducing an ad-supported, short-form mobile video service. 
 
""We said, Let's start with a mobile-first product,"" Marni Walden, Verizon's president of product innovation and new businesses, told Reuters on Thursday. ""The thought is that there could be a companion product that would come at some point in the future that could be in-home"" for TVs.   
 
Verizon wanted to leverage its mobile network to stand out in a crowded streaming video market, Walden said. 
 
Dish Network Corp and Sony Corp also offer online video services. On Wednesday, Apple Inc announced an improved version of its set-top box, Apple TV, without details on new content agreements. 
 
""Our focus is all on our mobile product today,"" Walden said. ""We have to be successful with this product first and then we would have the right to say, 'Yes, let's go do the companion.'""   
 
Go90 was developed from OnCue video streaming technology, which Verizon purchased from Intel Corp in 2014.   
 
""We don't believe trying to replace linear TV is the right thing,"" Walden said. ""We don't think the initial model we saw in Intel Media with $80 broadband and $80 content was one we could win at, particularly with all of the clutter and noise in that same space."" 
 
Go90's content partners include the National Football League, VH1, the Food Network and ESPN. From the Web, it will offer videos from Maker Studios, Machinima and AwesomenessTV, among others. 
 
Verizon is also considering letting users create content in the future, Walden said. 
 
Go90 will use Verizon's multicast video technology that streams live events to multiple mobile devices through a single lane of airwaves. 
 
Moving forward, Verizon aspires to relay events to a global audience, although that would require negotiating streaming rights, Walden said.

6506,"After a few delays, Gunchie’s has now opened their second location in Rock Island in what was the old Hunter’s Club (most recently, Dyce’s Sports Bar).  Those of you that have been in their west Davenport location will be surprised.  The place is modern and full of exposed brick and fieldstone, and plenty of flat screens.  Though I haven’t had it yet, many people have told me they have the best pizza in Davenport.  I can foresee watching some college football here and seeing how the pizza stacks up against Bad Boy’z or Poor Boys. Spartan’s Pub actually opened almost three months ago in what was the Oceanside Lounge on Hickory Grove Rd. in Davenport, while I was still driving by where I thought it was going to be on Brady, just south of Kimberly (thanks to Rick Martin of quadcitiesdiningguide.com for the heads up).  As far as the place I didn’t get the sense that they’d changed much, though it had been a while since I’d been to the Oceanside.  Still a serviceable neighborhood dive. I knew that The Enchanted Inn in far west Davenport had changed its name to Dee’s Catfish Cove some time ago, but I didn’t feel comfortable going there and adding it to my total until they put up a new sign.  They did, so I did.  No other changes, nothing else to report. Clint’s Pizza closed over the summer at Highland Park Bowl, but the owner found an old service station on 7th St. in Moline and turned it into Clint’s Draft House.  Nice size U-shaped bar with 13 ft. ceilings, tinier restaurant area then the prior location, but a nice patio out front. Last addition is (was) the Ruby Tuesday’s that used to be in Northpark Mall.  I’d forgotten the time or two we stopped there after doing some Christmas shopping (actually, I forgot it was ever there).   With those 5 additions, my total is 567. Other bar news: ·         Word is Cabana’s will be reopening (same name ownership, so no opportunity to add to my list).  This creates nice bar enclave east of the Rock Island District, along with The Polish Pub, Rooster’s, Rozz-Tox, Bent River, and Gunchie’s. ·         Analog Arcade Bar, which will be an old-school pinball / video game bar in downtown Davenport, somewhat cryptically announced they will open 10/23/2015 ·         Le Figaro / Star Bar in downtown Rock Island closed the end of June, leaving us without one of my favorite bartenders (and one of the first to serve me in the Quad Cities), Darryl. ·         Speaking of favorite bartenders, Maddy has moved from Caddy’s in Bettendorf to The Starting Line in Davenport, and a new addition to my list, Charlee splits her time between Governor’s in Bettendorf and The Starting Line. ·         I’ve taken Rascal’s Live of my What’s Left list, as it’s part of Rascal’s, with no separate bar.  With the others I knocked off, the list is at 7. BAR NET GAIN/LOSS With this post, I’m beginning a project to see what the net bar loss / gain is in the Quad Cities since I started tracking this back in May of 2009.  This is a bit of a memory stretch, so please comment if you recall any other changes.  I begin with Davenport: Bars that closed after 5/1/09 (that haven’t reopened, or is no longer a bar): 1.        Nan’s Piano Bar 2.        Balls and Pucks 3.        Penguins 4.        Tiki Bar at Modern Woodmen 5.        Frick’s Tap 6.        Joe’s Club 7.        Vivian’s Tap 8.        Blueport Junction 9.        Big Daddy’s 10.     Graze 11.     Ruby Tuesday Locations that were not open as a bar on 5/1/09 that are now bars (including other bars at the same location): 1.        Barrel House 211 2.        Great River Brewery 3.        Brady St Pub >The Starting Line 4.        Cru 5.        Bix Lounge 6.        Black Hawk Bowl & Martini Lounge 7.        DaVinci’s > The Office 8.        Me & Billy 9.        Front Street Tap Toom 10.     Bleyart’s Tap 11.     Brew In The Village 12.     Stickman’s 13.     The Grape Life 14.     The J Bar 15.     Symposium Café > Red Lantern 16.     Los Agaves (Utica Ridge) 17.     Osaka 18.     R Bar 19.     Bad Boy’z Pizza 20.     Pint’s 21.     Barrel House (Utica Ridge) If my memory is correct, that’s a +10 net for Davenport.

According to Madison Fire Department, around 11 a.m. employees at Paisan's Italian Restaurant on W. Wilson Street were getting ready to open for the day when they noticed a fire in the pizza oven ventilation system.

When firefighters arrived at the restaurant, they saw heavy, gray and black smoke coming from a ventilation fan on the side of the building. Crews were able to quickly put out the fire using a small amount of water.

Fire officials say the fire still caused about $100,000 in damage. The restaurant will be closed until repairs are finished.

1255,"Day two (Tuesday) of our trip was amazing! Each day we spend here, we can feel a piece of hearts being left behind. This morning we started the mudding process. After lunch, Red Bird's director, Earl too our team to the Senior Center to visit the elderly community that meet together twice a week, plus he gave us a scenic tour to have a home visit with a local lady..We met Pansy at the Senior Center, who has connections with past WRCC teams. She overflowed with gratitude for everything Red Bird does for the seniors as well Clay County. Pansy is a young 85 year old sweetheart who beamed with pride as she showed us her quilting work. We couldn't resist her strong sales tactics, and purchased several handmade items to bring back home!
At the home of, Galin, we were able to visit with her and her grandchild. We instantly feel in love with this family. Her energy, kindness, and positive thoughts filled our hearts. This was an eye opening experience for our team to truly see how others live in such depressed/poor conditions in the U.S. Our team loved on them--knowing not to fix them; just love them. She proudly showed us the work Red Bird had done on her house and how much she loves each person involved in helping.Dinner that night, our team had clean-up duty. 3 of the team met our cook, Gail, an Appalachia resident (pictured). She is beautiful! She shared her love for Red Bird--by being employed , she can make direct deposits to the dental clinic on campus for her much needed dental work. She expressed more than once her lack of confidence and beauty. However, all our team saw was her beauty shining through--even after working non-stop serving the 150+ volunteers for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!
Today, we were reminded how BIG God is and how HIS PLANS always prevails. Over 90 years ago, six women prayed for a mission to come to this area in Kentucky. AND...this team of six women responded to God's nudge to go and Be The Light.

9725,"Is anyone really surprised? What will bring about a real shift in power? Most Nations Miss a Goal for Women in Leadership
a wingtip The corridors of the United Nations hummed on Monday as hundreds of men, in polished wingtips and natty ties, arrived here for the annual conclave of lawmakers from around the world. By now, the other half of humanity was to be better represented in their ranks. Yet despite a promise made by world leaders two decades ago to have women make up at least 30 percent of their national legislatures, most of the world’s parliaments remain largely the province of men… Among 190 countries, only 44 legislatures have met the 30 percent goal, according to an analysis by the Inter-Parliamentary Union. They include Rwanda (nearly 64 percent of members of its lower house of Parliament are women) and Bolivia (53 percent). The United States is not among those that met the target. Among members of the House of Representatives, 19 percent are women, and in the Senate, the figure is 20 percent. In India, the world’s most populous democracy, women’s representation is even lower: 12 and 12.8 percent, respectively, in its lower and upper houses… Baroness Frances D’Souza, speaker of the British House of Lords...  spoke of the need for legislatures to institute laws to stanch violence against women. But by and large, the speakers addressed everything other than how their countries planned to address the gender imbalance in their own legislatures… There has been some progress since world leaders agreed on the 30 percent target in 1995 at the landmark Beijing women’s conference. At that time, only 11 percent of the world’s lawmakers were women, and that figure has doubled to 22 percent in 2015, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union… “Women face a host of difficulties in gaining access to parliament: cultural norms, gender roles, party practices, lack of financial support, and a traditionally masculine work environment — which together tend to favor and attract men and discriminate against and discourage the participation of women,” the report said… When world leaders descend here at the end of September for the annual summit meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, the share of women is expected to be far worse. Among its 193 member states, only 10 heads of state are women.

During his final mass while in the U.S., Pope Francis stressed the importance of love, not only within your own family, but with all the families of the world. VPC

PHILADELPHIA — Pope Francis celebrated Mass with hundreds of thousands in the streets of the City of Brotherly Love on Sunday, closing his historic six-day visit to the U.S. where he drew big and enthusiastic crowds wherever he went. 

His visit to Philadelphia, the third leg of his U.S. trip that also took him to New York and Washington, coincided with the World Meeting of Families, and Francis used his final scheduled public appearance of the trip to connect faith with family. 

In his homily, Francis told the faithful that much like happiness, ""holiness is always tied to little gestures."" 

""These little gestures are those we learn at home, in the family; they get lost amid all the other things we do, yet they do make each day different,"" Francis said. ""They are the quiet things done by mothers and grandmothers, by fathers and grandfathers, by children. They are little signs of tenderness, affection and compassion."" 

At the conclusion of his Mass, Francis made one small personal request. “I ask you to pray for me,"" Francis said. ""Don’t forget!” 

Organizers said the Mass, which Francis celebrated a stone's throw away from the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art made famous in the movie Rocky , was expected to draw as many as 1 million participants. It capped a busy day for the pontiff, who spoke to victims of clergy sex abuse and vowed to provide ""careful oversight"" to protect young believers in the future. 

He also visited a correctional facility where he blessed inmates and made an unscheduled stop at a local Jesuit university. Later Sunday evening, Francis will depart for the Vatican. Vice President Biden is scheduled to travel to Philadelphia to bid him farewell. 

Catholics, as well as non-Catholics who are simply fans of ""the people's pope,"" began flooding the Benjamin Franklin Parkway early on an overcast Sunday in hopes of landing a prime spot to bid Francis farewell. The parkway, an iconic thoroughfare, was dotted with big screens to watch the 78-year-old pontiff deliver his final message to the American people before his return trip to Rome. 

Boisterous church groups banging drums and singing songs went suddenly silent as the first strains of the musical preludes of the service wafted over the city streets. Crowds blocks away joined in the chanting and prayers as Mass began.

The crowds were packed as far away as Philadelphia's city hall, more than a mile from the pope's altar. The Mass could be heard across much of the city's downtown, where crowds stood rapt watching the celebration on the big screens. 

""We are having a blessed time,"" said Maureen Cobb, 65, a retired teacher from Canal Winchester, Ohio. ""The weather is beautiful, the people are beautiful. All these Christians who want to celebrate the good news of Jesus Christ."" 

Long lines stretched for hours ahead of the Mass, as National Guard soldiers worked to keep the surging crowds orderly. 

Steve Mitchell, 61, a deacon from the archdiocese in Detroit, finally gave up as the crowds around him grew unbearably dense and stopped moving. His wife had extricated herself earlier after being jostled one too many times. 

Mitchell said he wasn't surprised by the huge numbers of people going to great effort to see the pope celebrate his last Mass in the United States. ""It's a historic moment,"" he said. ""This is a guy who has caught the attention of everyone. He's everyone's pope. Non-Catholics, even atheists."" 

Tom Delesandro, 33, a teacher from Rockledge, Pa., was on the parkway with his mother, wife and 16-month-old daughter, Ava. 

""We just wanted to take all this in,"" he said with Ava in his arms. ""This is an amazing day, a once or twice in a lifetime opportunity. I'm just hoping my daughter can catch a glimpse of the pope."" 

Denese Sadowski's journey to see Francis began early Sunday morning in Brandywine, Pa., but ended in disappointment in Center City where crowds overwhelmed one of 15 security checkpoints into the papal Mass. 

Sadowski, a business analyst, had a ticket that was supposed to give her access to the pontiff's parade route and possibly a view of the altar where the pope would sit. But by 2 p.m., she had resigned herself to watching the service on one of 40 giant screens scattered through downtown. 

""It's an experience. And even if I don't get in, I'm happy to be here,"" she said. ""I love him. I think he's very modernized, and I hope he'll bring more people to the Catholic Church."" 

Ahead of the Mass, Francis made an unscheduled stop at Saint Joseph’s University to view a newly dedicated statue commemorating the 50th anniversary of Nostra Aetate, a Vatican II document that helped bolster the relationship between the Catholic and Jewish faiths. 

The document highlighted the historic bond between the two faiths and dismissed past efforts by the Church to convert Jews. Saint Joseph’s, a Jesuit university, established the Institute for Jewish-Catholic Relations in 1967 in response to the Vatican call for strengthening the interfaith relationship. 

Earlier Sunday, Francis met privately with a group of clergy sex abuse victims. In remarks to bishops from around the globe, Francis said ""grievous harm"" has been caused by the clergy sex abuse scandal that has marred the church for more than a decade. The pontiff promised to hold those responsible for such offenses accountable. 

""I remain overwhelmed with shame that men entrusted with the tender care of children violated these little ones and caused grievous harm,"" he added. ""I am profoundly sorry. God weeps."" 

The Vatican said Francis met with five adult victims — three women and two men — who were abused by clergy, family members or teachers when they were minors. 

In his address to bishops, Francis focused on the difficulties of supporting the family structure in a rapidly changing world. 

""Needless to say, our understanding, shaped by the interplay of ecclesial faith and the conjugal experience of sacramental grace, must not lead us to disregard the unprecedented changes taking place in contemporary society, with their social, cultural – and now juridical – effects on family bonds,"" Francis said. ""These changes affect all of us, believers and non-believers alike. Christians are not 'immune' to the changes of their times."" 

Francis also visited the Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility, where he met with dozens of inmates. The pontiff offered the prisoners — who included suspected murders, rapists and mobsters — words of hope and spoke to them about forgiveness and redemption. 

Francis told the inmates that scripture says Jesus washed his apostles’ feet at the Last Supper. In the past, the pope has repeated that ritual — washing the feet of elderly people with disabilities as well as young people at a juvenile detention center. 

The pontiff also told the the inmates that they were not alone, intoning that ""all of us have something we need to be cleansed of, or purified from."" 

""The lord goes in search of us, to all of us he stretches out a helping hand,"" said Francis, who shook hands with each inmate and offered several blessings. ""It is painful when we see prison systems which are not concerned to care for wounds, to soothe pain, to offer new possibilities. It is painful when we see people who think that only others need to be cleansed, purified, and do not recognize that their weariness, pain and wounds are also the weariness, pain and wounds of society.""

3023,"Sony's faith-based drama ""War Room"" has the edge on N.W.A biopic ""Straight Outta Compton"" with $9.3 million to lead the modest U.S. box office over the Friday-Sunday weekend. 
 
""Straight Outta Compton"" took in $8.9 million at 3,094 locations in its fourth weekend, ending its impressive three-week winning streak at domestic multiplexes. The title should add another $2.3 million on Monday to cross the $150 million milestone, representing another triumph for Universal in a stellar 2015. 
 
Sony/Affirm's ""War Room"" has continued to exceed projections following its surprisingly robust opening weekend, when it took in $11.4 million. The film, playing at 1,526 sites, is on track for a four-day Labour Day weekend haul of $12.3 million, bringing its 11-day total to $27.6 million.

""War Room"" stars Priscilla Shirer, T.C. Stallings and Karen Abercrombie and was directed by Alex Kendrick. It carries a low-budget price tag of $3.5 million and is the best performer in the genre since Sony's ""Heaven Is for Real"" took in $91 million in the U.S. last year. 
 
""It's clearly a movie that's resonating with under-served audiences that are usually left out of the conversation,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst with Rentrak. 
 
The holiday weekend appears to be the quietest of the year, which will be first of 2015 without a title topping the $10 million mark over the three-day period. 
 
Robert Redford's comedy ""A Walk in the Woods"" led the rest of the pack with $8.1 million at 1,960 sites and was projected to tack on $2.2 million on Monday. That's a decent performance for the first wide release from year-old Broad Green Pictures, the ambitious studio launched by brothers Gabriel and Daniel Hammond.

Paramount's sixth weekend of ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation"" and EuropaCorp's launch of ""The Transporter Refueled"" were battling for fourth place. The fifth ""Mission: Impossible"" took in $7.2 million at 2,849 locations for the three days and was projected to add $2.1 million on Labor Day to boost its domestic total to $182.5 million. 
 
The fourth ""Transporter"" brought in $7.1 million in 3,494 locations for Friday-Sunday and was projected to wind up the four days with $8.7 million.

3350,"Incidents took place at Sayreville War Memorial High School in Parlin, N.J. 
Six then-football players from a New Jersey high school known for its gridiron victories have been placed on probation -- but have been spared from being labeled sex offenders -- for sexually hazing freshmen in a locker room during the 2014 season, a prosecutor's office announced Monday. 

Four football players will be on probation for two years and must do 50 hours of community service after they pleaded guilty to charges of ""committing a disorderly persons offense of hazing"" and ""third degree endangering the welfare of their younger fellow teammates,"" the Middlesex County, New Jersey, Prosecutor's Office said in a news release. 

Two others were placed on one-year probation in addition to community service after the county's family court ruled them adjudicated delinquent -- which equates to a finding that they broke the law -- according to the release. A seventh defendant is still awaiting trial. 

After obtaining input from the victims and their families on a plea deal, the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office decided not to insist that the juveniles become registered sex offenders. The identities of those involved were withheld because of their ages. 

The Sayreville War Memorial High School principal -- who, according to the news release, had ""no personal knowledge of the assaults and abuses that occurred"" -- testified in family court as a ""character witness"" for the two juvenile defendants who were ruled adjudicated delinquent. 

The charges stem from four separate incidents in September 2014 in the locker room of Sayreville High in Parlin just south of Staten Island, New York, a school that has long prided itself on a tradition of state championship victories. 

On several occasions, older teammates sexually assaulted their younger teammates, including body-slamming them, grabbing their private parts and attempting to ""digitally penetrate"" the freshman, according to the prosecutor's office. 

Sayreville School District Superintendent Richard Labbe said in a statement after the stories came out last year, ""There were incidents of harassment, intimidation that took place on a pervasive level, in which the players knew, tolerated and in general accepted."" 

The district's board of education ""takes this matter extremely seriously and thus will continue to make the safety and welfare of our students, particularly the victims of these horrendous alleged acts, our highest priority,"" Labbe added. 

Labbe halted Sayreville's 2014 football season after the initial reports. 

The coaching staff was also disciplined following the incidents. The head coach and four of his assistants were suspended with pay, according to an announcement by the school in October.

1678,"01:13 Tuesday 08 September 2015 The state of Britain's local roads is the number one gripe among drivers, according to a survey. 

One in 10 motorists said the condition of local roads was their top concern, while a further 20% listed it as one of their four main issues. 

The RAC said the figures show that councils should be under the same legal obligation to maintain roads as they are to provide minimum standards for education and social services. 

The Local Government Association (LGA) insisted that current funding levels mean councils cannot afford to carry out long-term improvements on roads.

Half of the 1,500 motorists polled believe the quality of roads in their area has deteriorated in the past 12 months with just 10% claiming it has improved. The remainder reported no change. 

The study was commissioned for the RAC's 2015 Report on Motoring. 

Among the 50% who believe the roads in their area are getting worse, the vast majority (99%) attribute this to potholes and general damage to the road surface. 

Litter is a source of annoyance for a quarter of people (24%), while poor maintenance of verges annoys one in five (21%).

RAC chief engineer David Bizley urged councils to spend more of their funds on repairing and replacing road surfaces. 

""They are under specific legal obligation to provide minimum standards in education and social services whereas their obligations to maintain roads are far less prescriptive,"" he said. 

""It is therefore inevitable that expenditure is biased against investment in the likes of road maintenance where prescriptive legal obligations do not exist and councillors therefore do not face legal sanctions.""

Mr Bizley warned there is a ""damaging disconnection"" between what a ""large proportion"" of council tax payers want local government to spend their money on and where it actually goes.

But councillor Peter Box, transport spokesman for the LGA, said councils have to prioritise their expenditure. 

"" While councils share the frustration of motorists at the state of our roads, it is impossible to compare repairing potholes with keeping children safe and caring for our elderly,"" he said. 

""With demand on these life and death services continuing to rise and funding from central government continuing to reduce, councils have little choice but to squeeze budgets for other services, such as maintaining our roads."" 

He added: ""Current funding levels mean councils are only able to keep pace with patching up our roads and filling potholes rather than carrying out more cost-effective and long-term improvements."" 

Michael Dugher, Labour's shadow transport secretary, said: ""Ministers are just not listening to motorists' concerns. They promised they would fix our local roads and the pothole crisis, but it was just all talk. 

""Road users have understandably had enough of their failure and broken promises."" 

But the Department for Transport (DfT) insisted that it was ""playing our part"". 

A DfT spokesman said: ""A well maintained local road network is essential for all road users. 

""We are playing our part by providing nearly £6 billion to councils in England to maintain local roads over the next six years. This funding includes incentives so councils plan ahead and repair roads properly so potholes never form in the first place.""

 September 10, 2015  
Title: Boda Boda Anthem & Other Poems 
 
Publisher: Babishai Niwe Poetry Publication 
 
Year: 2015 
 
Edited by: Mildred K Barya 
 
Poets have talked about cities since the beginning of time. In the Bible, Jeremiah laments of the destruction of Jerusalem, a funeral dirge for the loss of a city, rent out in acrostic verse. We recall Tyrtaeus, the first poet of Greek city state, who composed verses in Sparta. Possibly no other poet in post-colonial Africa has mapped a city — in so few yet so powerful words — as J.P. Clark in Ibadan. 
 
Babishai Niwe (BN) Poetry Foundation, under the guidance of Beverley Nambozo Nsengiyunva, set out to imagine Kampala through poetry, leading to the publication of Boda Boda Anthem & Other Poems, edited by Mildred K Barya. The poems are grouped into four thematic areas: ‘Ubuntu’, ‘Kampala City Y’ani’, ‘How Do You Say Kampala with an Accent’, and ‘Marry Me, Kampala’. These are portraits of Kampala, but they are fragmented and produce a shock of the real. They are testimonial and document an age. 
 
The poem, Boda Boda Anthem, introduces us to the chaos of Kampala. Boda Bodas are imaged as ‘hordes of demons searching/packs of hounds game hunting/death throttles clamouring for blood’. These Boda Bodas whizz through Kampala’s dust-ridden streets leaving carnage and death in their wake. They pride themselves as the ‘unbwogable force of renegade commandos’. Unbwogable’ is a word coined from a Luo word ‘bwogo’ meaning to ‘scare’ and ‘unbwogable. means ‘you can’t scare me’. The term originated from a song by Kenyan rap duo Gidigidi Majimaji. The throttlehold Boda Bodas have on Kampala streets presents a grim picture. One wonders whether Boda Bodas are the cause or the consequence of a city’s (dys)function. One wonders if Boda Bodas are a political metaphor. 
 
In Larok from Napak, written by Paula Biraaro, Kampala is pictured as a concrete jungle. Katanga, by Ian Kiyingi Muddu, captures degeneration accompanying consumerism: ‘a/ State-kept /rubbish heap of /Sh*t Condoms Cigarette butts Tots and People/. The narratives of daily surviving the city litter almost every page. In Two Mighty Hills by Musinguzi Ray Robert, we are informed that Kampala is ‘a city that is no longer safe for a frog’, yet despite the tone of desperation, the poet still ‘longs for a day when he will/Call Kampala a home of patriots/ Not genuflecting purists.’ Froth, by Mulumba Ivan Matthias, laments the brutality of law enforcers, while Bring then Take, by Cherret Ndiwa Leakey, laments economic dispossession by the Chinese: they ‘bring in all they can to sell/ they bring in the machines plus the construction materials for the roads./ The Chinese take away all they can’. In U@50 by Paula Biraaro, she asks Kampala: ‘will you slip into menopausal madness?/ Become a beneficiary of memory lapses,/ Reminiscing about the bush ol’ days?’ 
 
Yet Kampala does not kill all her cubs. In Unveiling My Bride Kampala, we find an effusive tone – coy and seductive: ‘My beautiful bride Kampala/ You make my heart sing lalala/ My heart cannot stop staring at you... / On you I will spend all my money/ If that would impress you, honey.’ In Rolled Eggs, by Mark Gordon Musinguzi, we are told that “you have not known the true taste of Kampala until you hold in your hand/ Something more precious that your silver watch, (two chapattis and rolled eggs) a Wandegeya Rolex’. 
 
There are Two Sides of Kampala: which is also the title of the poem by Kiwanuka George, one is comforting and gives the confidence of an organized, disciplined, and clean ambience, the other embraces the night’s evil veil and sends cold shivers down people’s spine. To some Kampala is a concrete jungle to some, to others it is, the Canaan of matooke and pork to others. But cities are dynamic, perplexing, and uncertain beings and notoriously difficult to map. Cities can be fictions. One is never sure whether the poets talking about Kampala or Uganda? Or Nairobi, Lagos, or Johannesburg? The fact that the anthology features poets from eighteen countries has created a diverse mix of images of Kampala cannot be pigeon-holed into a single interpretive lens. 
 
One thing is certain though, like A Thousand Voices Rising, this anthology – Boda Boda Anthem & Other Poems – is definitive of the rising stature of Kampala as a literature convent and a drinking hole for African poets.

2170,"Mazda's president says the company has a team of engineers working on rotary engines, but won't explain exactly what these engines will be used for if they're ever deemed production ready.
The post appeared first on Digital…  
Ask many enthusiasts what models they’d like to see make a comeback, and a rotary-powered sports car from Mazda is often high on the list. Since the RX-8 was killed off in 2012, fans have been clamoring for a replacement, or an even sportier model in the vein of the old RX-7 

. 

There have been rumors of a rotary return, but given Mazda’s apparent official disinterest in a new sports car, they’ve seemed more like wishful thinking than indicators of the future. That doesn’t mean Mazda isn’t still interested in rotaries, though. The company has a research team working on them, according to Autocar 

. 

Speaking to the magazine at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show, Mazda president Masamichi Kogai said this dedicated engineering team is working “very enthusiastically” to bring rotary engines up to the standards of current piston engines. Fuel-consumption and emissions performance were among the drawbacks of previous rotary engines and, in today’s stricter regulatory environment, those factors will likely make or break any potential new rotary-powered model. 

Related: Mazda 6-based coupe with rotary power rumored 

Kogai would not elaborate on why Mazda is still experimenting with rotary engines. Company officials have repeatedly denied rumors of an RX-7 or RX-8 successor.

5460,"Santander is to dramatically hike the fees on some of its most popular products in a move that has been described as a ""kick in the teeth"" for customers. 
 
From January the annual cost of its 123 current account will soar from £24 to £60, while for the 123 credit card this jumps from £24 to £36. 
 
The bank will also introduce a cap on the amount of cashback new customers can earn on the credit card. 
 
Millions of people have flocked to Santander in recent years due to the popularity of these products - and the current account in particular, which allows savers to earn up to 3% interest on balances of up to £20,000. 
 
The bank claims it was forced to make the changes as a result of the rising cost of banking in the UK. 
 
However, Nicolas Frankcom, of uSwitch, noted that the timing of the announcement is odd given that a host of other banks are currently increasing their incentives to attract new customers. 
 
""An almost threefold increase in fees is a huge kick in the teeth for Santander 123 customers,"" he said. 
 
""Many will feel cheated by Santander moving the goalposts, and those drawn in by tempting cashback offers will have to spend more on household bills just to break even. 
 
""It may be time for their customers to check how much they are earning on the account and vote with their feet if they are not seeing value for money. Competition in the current account market is hotting up with more banks like Halifax, TSB and Clydesdale bringing in switching incentives, and lots of accounts on the market still offering high interest on balances.""

TAGBILARAN CITY, Bohol: A National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) team from the Central Visayas Regional Office swooped down on Klikmart Shopping Mart Corporation in Tagbilaran City on Thursday. 
 
The team, led by NBI Special Investigator Agapito Gierran, arrived at the office of Klikmart Rewards around 7 p.m. armed with a search warrant issued by Vice Executive Judge Leo Moises Lison for alleged violations of Republic Act 8799 or The Securities Regulation Code. The warrant was received by a certain Ruben Lurot. 
 
The NBI team confiscated sales invoices, membership registration forms, official receipts, ledgers, journals, and all other books of accounts and documents used in recording investments. 
 
The team also confiscated money collected for the purported investment activities, flyers and other advertising manuals, as well as projector or visual aid, laptop, desktop computers and security cameras being used by the company. 
 
Members of Klikmart Rewards said they have no idea that the company is conducting illegal operations because they immediately got returns on their investments, placed at a minimum of P1,500 and have started to receive P15,000 twice a month. 
 
Section 8 of the Securities Regulation Code states that “Securities shall not be sold or offered for sale or distribution within the Philippines, without a registration statement duly filed with and approved by the Commission. Prior to such sale, information on the securities, in such form and with such substance as the Commission may prescribe, shall be made available to each prospective purchaser.” 
 
Section 28 of the same law also states that “No person shall engage in the business of buying or selling securities in the Philippine as a broker or dealer, or act as a salesman, or an associated person of any broker or dealer unless registered as such with the Commission.” 
 
The said law provides that violators will be fined P50,000 to P5 million or imprisonment of seven years to 21 years, or both in the discretion of the court.

836,"An estranged father tracked down his seven-year-old daughter and shot her in the head on her doorstep before turning the gun on himself, an inquest has heard. 
 
East Sussex coroner Alan Craze described the murder outside a ""safe house"" as a ""thoroughly despicable act of violence"" and said: ""It was not in any way spontaneous. It was pre-meditated over a long period of time."" 
 
Mary Shipstone, also known as Maryam Alromisse, was gunned down as she stood next to her mother, clutching a new violin, after she returned from school on September 11 last year, Hastings Coroner's Court was told. 
 
Her father, Yasser Alromisse, 46, was hidden in the rear of a silver Toyota on the drive by the house, in Northiam, near Rye, East Sussex, when he fired the shots. 
 
The attack took place at Spring Hill, where Mary had lived with her mother Lyndsey Shipstone, for the past year.  She did not want be traced by Alromisse after the collapse of their marriage, which she said had been abusive. 
 
Alromisse had hired the vehicle that morning in Worthing, insisting to rental staff that he needed one with tinted windows, and had created a blind from bin bags to shield himself, the hearing was told. 
 
His body was later found in a pool of blood in the rear of the car, where he had shot himself in the head. 
 
Mr Craze concluded that Mary had been unlawfully killed, and ruled her father's death as suicide. 
 
The court heard how Alromisse had hired private detective Paul Parton, purporting to be a friend of his ex-wife, in May 2014 to try and establish the location of Mrs Shipstone, who he was still legally married to. 
 
Mr Parton was unable to locate Mrs Shipstone and later withdrew his services concerned Alromisse's motive was to take away the child. 
   Promoted stories   
Coroner Mr Craze said it was not clear how Alromisse eventually found the address, but described the murder as a ""thoroughly despicable act of violence"". 
 
He added: ""It was not in any way spontaneous. It was pre-meditated over a long period of time."" 
 
Describing the day of the shooting, Mrs Shipstone said it had been ""ordinary"", but that Mary was ""very happy"" and ""excited"" about her birthday in seven days' time. 
 
She had been driven by a neighbour to collect Mary from school where she had had her first violin lesson. They parked up at their neighbour's and walked back towards their house. 
 
Mrs Shipstone told the court: ""I was putting my key in the door, and I spoke to Mary, saying she'd like what I had done to her room, and that's the last thing I said to her."" 
 
Mary was stood slightly behind her when she heard a loud noise. 
 
She said: ""There was a terrific sound behind me like someone had burst a balloon. 
 
""I turned around and the first thing I saw was Mary on the ground - her legs were crumpled behind her."" 
 
She said she quickly realised that her ex-partner had shot Mary, saying she could ""see his face"" in the back seat of the Toyota parked on the nearby drive. 
 
She told the inquest: ""He did not show any emotion."" 
 
Mrs Shipstone carried Mary to a neighbour's home, where they tried to revive her while waiting for emergency services to arrive.  She was taken to King's College Hospital, London, but later died of her injuries. 
 
Asked why Alromisse would have wanted to kill Mary, Mrs Shipstone replied: ""I don't think I will ever really know that. 
 
""It was such an extreme thing to do. I can only guess that he wanted to kill himself and for some reason he thought that she should not live without him."" 
 
She added: ""He had the opportunity to shoot me as well, but he chose not to do it, and I was the one he supposedly hated the most. 
 
""It's an act of revenge really. It's got to be. If he really loved her he would never have inflicted that on her."" 
 
Mrs Shipstone told the court: ""He's left me bereft of a daughter"". 
 
Mr Craze described it as a ""very sad and tragic case"". 
 
Speaking to Mrs Shipstone after reaching his conclusion, he said: ""You will, I hope, be relieved that the whole process of the coroner's inquest is over with.

1290,"Scientists at the University of Twente in the Netherlands have devised a new type of electronic chip that takes after the human brain. Their device is highly power-conscious, massively parallel, and can manipulate data in arbitrary ways – even though it doesn't need to be explicitely designed to perform any task. The advance could pave the way for computers that think more like we do. 
 (When the) chips are down  
Electronic chips as they are currently designed come with plenty of drawbacks. Even the simplest operations, like adding or subtracting, need large numbers of transistors arranged in a very specific, well thought-out pattern. These transistors quickly add up and drain power even when idle (unless specific measures are taken). Moreover, most circuits can't effectively process information in parallel, leading to a further waste of time and energy. 
 
All of these factors make it especially hard for today's computers to perform many crucial tasks quickly and on little power – particularly the kinds of tasks that the human brain can tackle with ease, like recognizing a visual pattern or understanding human language. In fact, when it comes to simulating brain-like functionality, many researchers have opted to abandon traditional computer architectures altogether. 
 
Alternative chip designs that try to mimic the prowess and efficiency of the brain usually do so by either resorting to massive parallelism or by using neuron-like structures as their basic building blocks. But these approaches retain one big drawback: they still rely on fallible human minds to design their hardware and software. 
 No design needed  
A research team led by professors Wilfried van der Wiel and Hajo Broersma is walking a different path. Remarkably, their device takes people out of the the circuit design equation altogether and leaves it to the chip itself to figure out how to best manipulate its inputs into the desired output through artificial evolution. 
 
Their proof-of-principle device consists of a network of up to 100 densely interconnected gold nanoparticles, 20 nanometers in size, each acting as a tiny transistor . The researchers call it a natural computer , because the way in which the particles are interlinked is reminiscent of neural networks in the brain. Unlike in a standard circuit, the scientists themselves don't exactly know how the transistors in a natural computer connect with each other – but this doesn't stop the circuit from working as intended. 
 
Here's, in a nutshell, how it all works. The nanoparticle cluster can be thought of as a black box containing two input signals, one output signal, and six control voltages that are fed to the edge of the cluster and affect how the network elaborates its inputs. Rather than designing the entire circuit by hand, the researchers can simply look for the exact combination of control voltages that process all the inputs into the correct outputs. 
    
""Although we understand the generic physics principles underlying the cluster’s behavior, we do not know the actual current paths in the network on a nanoscale level,"" van der Weil told Gizmag. 
 
Using ""designless"" systems such as this means that costly design mistakes are avoided, and in fact this approach can work around, or even take advantage of, material defects like crosstalk that must be avoided at all costs in conventional electronics. 
 
Even better, if the chip were to sustain heavy damage, it could still be reconfigured just as easily by adjusting the voltage values for the signals that control how the nanoparticle cluster manipulates the data. 
 Natural selection and ""baby voltages""  
Selection of the optimal values for the six control voltages is not done manually or even by brute force, but instead by using something called a genetic algorithm (GA). In computer science, this is a clever (and well-known) way to optimize a set of parameters for an arbitrary condition. Just like the idea behind the circuit itself, GAs also take shameless inspiration from nature. 
 
The basic idea behind GAs is to create successive ""generations"" of values by ""marrying"" them to each other (by combining them and adding an element of randomness), and then seeing which of the ""offspring"" is the best fit. This is in obvious analogy to the way in which natural selection picks, through successive generations, the optimal gene pool that is best adapted to live in the surrounding environment. 
 
Though this process is more complicated than mere bruteforcing, it's also much faster. In this case, the researchers say the process takes less than an hour (as opposed to several days) to find all of the six voltage parameters for a set condition. 
 
Optimizing the voltages for different functionalities, the researchers were able to indirectly ""program"" the chip to act as any one of the Boolean logic gates . This was done using a number of nanoparticles comparable to the number of transistors that would be needed to implement the same function on a standard chip. 
 Toward brain-like computing  
According to the researchers, this structure has great potential for saving energy compared to a standard chip: 
 
""Natural computers have, in general, the promise to be more energy efficient,"" van der Weil told Gizmag. ""The promise for lower energy consumption is based on the fact that natural computers take more advantage of the computational power of matter than conventional computers, and that many computational processes occur in parallel as opposed to sequentially as in conventional computers."" 
 
The researchers also believe their device holds real promise with respect to complex tasks involving pattern recognition that the human brain excels at: 
 
""In our device many operations can occur in parallel, analogous to information processing in the brain,"" van der Weil continued. ""We know that the brain, but also mathematical neural networks, are very suitable for pattern recognition. We believe that our system can be a physical realization of a cellular neural network with the accompanying advantages compared to conventional circuits."" 
 
Their invention doesn't come without drawbacks, however. One being that the system can currently only operate at temperatures close to absolute zero – though the scientists tell us this can be easily fixed. 
 
""Our approach only works if the nanoparticles act as single-electron transistors and relies on Coulomb blockade ,"" says van der Wiel. ""For 20 nm nanoparticles this means that we have to be at temperatures lower than 5 Kelvin (-268° C, - 451° F) or so. However, there is no fundamental reason why our approach should not work at room temperature. This would require smaller nanoparticles."" 
 
A more complex circuit may need to use clusters of 100 nanoparticles as its elementary block, since optimizing larger nanoparticle networks through signals that only reach its periphery could be difficult. 
 
""We either need to go to interconnecting smaller networks, or to more advanced electrode configurations. This is work in progress,"" says van der Weil. 
 
The next steps for the team's research will be to ""create larger networks with more complex functionality, preferably at room temperature."" 
 
The findings have been published on the journal Nature Nanoelectronics .

6006,"Networks need to experiment with the way they deliver content to audiences as more eyeballs shift away from linear television, Turner Broadcasting Systems' Christina Miller says. Networks need to experiment with the way they deliver content to audiences as more eyeballs shift away from linear television, Turner Broadcasting Systems' Christina Miller says. Ms Miller, who is president and general manager of Cartoon Network, Adult Swim and Boomerang, said that the audience for her brands is like none before it.

""They're mobile natives, they don't ever want to go dark, they like a lot of choice, they're not daunted by it,"" said Ms Miller, who will speak at this week's Astra conference.

The world is changing for media and entertainment companies with competition for eyeballs between old and new players.

The evolving landscape has given some investors cause to pause.

Time Warner Inc, Turner Broadcasting System's parent company, was part of the rout of media shares on Wall Street in August, which started when Disney lowered its growth expectations for its network cable television division.

In August, Disney shares fell 15.1 per cent, 21st Century Fox (A) slipped 20.6 per cent, Time Warner Inc lost 19.2 per cent and Viacom dropped 24.3 per cent. Immersive experience is key

Adapting the offering, growing audience, and therefore advertising dollars, will be the main goal for media companies around the world.

Creating an immersive experience and staying ahead of change, not just catching up, is key for retaining and building an audience, the Atlanta-based Ms Miller said.

""I know we spend a lot of time as media executives talking in our own head about changing behaviour, and for us on the younger end of things, on the emerging audiences, it's a lot of creating behaviour,"" Ms Miller said.

""We create worlds not just shows, and make sure they can be accessed from everything from mobile devices to linear TV and can be consumed whether it's in 15 second formats or 22 minute formats, that it is available because I think the generation that's coming up at the moment can really filter through all those options and get what they want, when they want, where they want it.

""We just need to make sure that we can provide it across the spectrum and believe that the measurement part of it will catch up.""

There is no single way to launch a show and the best preparation is to be ready to go on all platforms, Ms Miller said.

""One over the other is an option, in some cases pre-launching episodes on VOD (video on-demand) for our network has proven to be very successful in the states and then being able to air them in a regular scheduled fashion across linear and then making sure they're surrounded with snack size content within our apps, gaming content within our games.""

Ms Miller's previous role at Turner saw her work closely with the National Basketball Association (NBA) across their digital assets, including NBA League Pass and NBA TV, the sport's subscription video on-demand service and 24 hour digital TV network.

Last year, the NBA signed a $US24 billion ($34 billion) nine-year broadcast rights deal with Turner Sports and ESPN. However, the NBA maintains still remains some digital rights.

Ms Miller said the balance between TV coverage and the NBA's own direct to consumer offering was creating an entertainment event, such as NBA on TNT on Thursday nights.

""The TNT package was a very exclusive package for Thursday night which made every Thursday night an event with a top notch double header which brings the likes of Charles Barkley and Kenny Smith and Shaq and Ernie all to the table,"" Ms Miller said.

""That show, Inside the NBA, does as well as most late night shows when it's on air in the [United] States.""

The NBA's own offering was there for hardcore fans and catering to specific audiences for things like out of market packages.

""That is the difference with the league asset, it's really feeding the deep fan, who can watch 24/7, 365, that wants to know what the trades are, is somebody being drafted, what coaches are taking on a new team, how much salary cap is left, what the latest stats are, all the rumours around free agency.""

8079,"When summer turns down the heat, when it can no longer cloak the edge of winter with its sweet, delicate fruit and easy freshness, we must remember again how to cook. Not that we haven’t cooked all summer—there have been sautés, fresh sauces, crowded grills—but the flavors have stayed so available, so forthright, we haven’t needed to add much more than salty cheese, a dousing of vinaigrette, a sear on the grill.

End-of-summer produce is a sultry lot; what was bursting with readiness is now reserved, its proteins and sugars turned meaty or starched in a way that implores the coaxing of a low flame. Our kitchens, too, are suddenly more habitable, their corners cooled by night’s deeper chill, asking, finally, for the symphonic perfume that comes from roasting. It seems right, this pair: a ready kitchen, vegetables seeking warmth.

What you can draw from one gently cooked vegetable—say a tomato, thick slices roasted into candy—expands exponentially when you combine it with a companion or two. These trinities (sometimes duos or quartets) live at the heart of almost every cuisine. They make the stitch between cooking and culture.

Take sofrito, paella’s backbone and the base of many Spanish, Portuguese, and Latin American soups, stews, and rice dishes. Cajun and Creole cooks call their sofrito the Holy Trinity, a trio of onion, celery, and green pepper finely diced and cooked until they sit in their own luscious sauce, ready for the next layer.

They go by different names, but all of these trinities are holy in their own rite, balancing sour and sweet, aroma and spice in a way that may best be summed up by the Italian word agrodulce. A mix of agro (sour) and dulce (sweet), agrodulce, at its most basic, is a sauce made of vinegar and sugar. But it also runs through a sofrito, where the acidity of a tomato meets the sweetness of roasted garlic, onion, and red pepper. Add zucchini and eggplant and you have ratatouille. Take away all but the tomato and onion, add ginger and coriander, and you have an Indian chutney. Give that chutney a couple spoonfulls of peanut butter instead of coriander, and you are on your way to Tongolese azi dessi.

Some trinities are strongly aromatic, such as German suppengrun (literally, “soup greens”), where carrots and leeks lend their earthy sugars to celeriac’s musk; or the French mirepoix—onion, carrot, and celery—offering the root vegetables’ subtle dulce a clean, cutting bitterness in lieu of overt acidity. Italian soffritto is more like mirepoix than its Spanish counterpart, starting with the same onion-carrot-celery base and adorning it with garlic, flat-leaf parsley, fennel, or cured meats. Szechuan cuisine’s holy trinity of ginger, garlic, and chile peppers marries sour and sweet with spice, as does the simplest Mexican rajas—strips of poblano peppers and onions slowly cooked in oil until supple and melded.

This kind of submission is what makes a trinity holy—the melting away of individual identity to become something if not greater, than at least unmistakably different than the sum of its parts. It is a way of cooking that does more than pair compatible flavors; it transforms them. But don’t go looking for texture, don’t expect crust or crunch. A good holy trinity is about softness, about giving up.

And so it is with end of summer vegetables; after months of freshness, I yearn for something deeper, something willing to fade into the background. This year, my trinity of choice is eggplant, tomato, and onion. I stew them slowly in a Dutch oven on the lowest heat, salted judiciously, oregano or thyme for character, a pinch of sugar and a dash of white wine for body. And because it is the last chance (or nearly so) for many other delicious things, from that rich, silky base I build.

Perhaps I’ll strip an ear of late season corn, its sugar becoming starch, adding creamy thickness and a pleasing pop to the stew’s texture. I throw in peppers, sweet or hot, for their meaty softness; Romano or green beans, less tender now than a month ago, which hold their shape after an hour’s simmer, absorbing the sauce and giving back supple firmness, something to chew on. Maybe I’ll cube that zucchini, a little spongy in the center, all the better now to absorb, to give.
You can keep going, adding what you like. Give it a grilled fish, a plate of pasta, a mound of polenta. Dip flatbread in it. Smother it with cheese. Bake it under a blanket of oiled breadcrumbs. Spread it on a sandwich with salami, a sausage. Make a crazy pizza topping out of it. Try it on ice cream. It doesn’t matter, because it takes its perfection with it. You’ve made something whole and, dolloped here, spread there, it stays that way.





























Yotam Ottolenghi's Eggplant Sauce
(adapted from Plenty)


With the addition of onion, softened just before the eggplant, this is the basic sauce I can't get enough of right now. I cook it longer than the recipe suggests, about forty minutes on a low flame for complete melding.

Serves 4


2/3 cup vegetable oil


1 medium eggplant, cut into 3/4-inch dice


2 tsp tomato paste


1/4 cup white wine


1 cup chopped peeled tomatoes (fresh or canned)


6 1/2 tbsp water


1/4 tsp salt


1/4 tsp sugar


1 tbsp chopped oregano (or 1 tsp dried)


1. Heat the oil in a large saucepan and fry the eggplant on medium heat for 15 minutes or until nicely browned. Drain off as much oil as you can and discard it.


2. Add the tomato paste and stir with the eggplant, cooking 2 minutes. Then add the wine and cook another minute more.


3. Add the chopped tomatoes, water, salt, sugar, and oregano and cook for an additional 10 or more minutes to get a deep-flavored sauce.


4. Serve on its own as a side dish, with pasta and a sprinkle of parmesan, or over a bed of soft polenta (feta--stirred into the polenta or crumbled on top of the sauce--makes a great addition).",9640ece6-88dc-4b4c-a85d-c36732b9af20,Blog,2015-09-10T23:22:10Z,The Fat of the Land,Holy Trinity,1.0,Blog

3002,"Avengers star Tom Hiddleston revealed that the Oscar buzz surrounding his highly anticipated portrayal of country music legend Hank Williams all seems ""imaginary"" as the movie received its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. 
 
The British actor, best known for his role as the villainous Loki in the Marvel superhero franchise, sings some of Williams' most famous country standards in the film I Saw The Light. 
 
He said he received a comprehensive education in the singer's impact on music. 
 
Speaking on the red carpet at the premiere at the Ryerson Theatre in Toronto, Hiddleston said: ""His music has left this extraordinary legacy and the songs he wrote like Hey, Good Lookin' and Cold, Cold Heart and I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry and Your Cheatin' Heart were country standards that singer like Ray Charles and Tony Bennett and Johnny Cash went on to cover, so I knew the songs but I didn't realise he was so young when he died. 
 
""He was 29 years old and left this legacy, Bob Dylan talks about his legacy, Bruce Springsteen talks about him and in some of his early songs you can hear rock and roll. 
 
""There is a song called Move It On Over and you can hear Rock Around The Clock coming round the corner in ten years' time so that was really exciting to me to realise where Hank sits in the stepping stones of twentieth century music."" 
 
Williams died from heart failure in 1953 after battling alcohol and pills while dealing with intense fame and scrutiny. 
 
Asked about the comparisons between Williams' fame and the attention Hiddleston has received, he said: ""His version of fame was very extreme and there is something more naked about being a singer-songwriter than being an actor perhaps, but certainly I think he struggled with the commercialism of what came from his heart and soul. 
   Promoted stories   
""He used to say 'they are slicing me up and selling me like baloney', so I think he really struggled with the idea that he was part of a machine that was about making money, whereas for him it was about communicating something to people and sharing that feeling and any creative person can relate to it in some way."" 
 
Hiddleston has already been mentioned as a possible contender in the best actor race when the Academy Awards roll around in 2016, but he said it is too far away to contemplate. 
 
""I can't really comment on that because it all seems so imaginary, it's really nothing to do with me in a way, so we will see what people say when they see the film."" 
 
The Toronto International Film Festival runs until September 20. 
 
The Bourne Identity star Matt Damon braved the Toronto rain for the world premiere of his new film, The Martian. 
 
Ridley Scott's big budget epic tells the story of an astronaut battling to survive on Mars alone after his Nasa crewmates leave him behind, mistakenly believing he is dead. 
 
The film, which also stars Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kate Mara and Kristen Wiig, maintains a sense of humour throughout, which Damon says is the key to its charm. 
 
""There would have been another way to tell this story that wouldn't have been as entertaining, that would have been an exercise in existential reality. 
 
""But the way we chose to go was fun and uplifting and optimistic ultimately, and that was the tone we were happy with because that is a good thing to put out into the world given what the headlines are."" 
 
Scott has long been on Damon's wishlist as a collaborator.

  In our town of staunch gourmands, if there ever was a restaurant serving upscale cuisine at everyday prices, the newly opened Nostra Spaghetteria would most likely put it to shame. Executive Chef/Owner, Alexander Alioto, a fourth generation restaurateur from a renowned San Francisco family, unveiled his new concept of affordable menu of high quality hand-made goodies and thoroughly selected wine, beer, and cocktail lists at his restaurant and bar (Bar Mia) on September 1.     
Growing up in the Italian food-focused family, and then spending years apprenticing in Italy, including at the two-star Michelin Ristorante San Domenico, Chef Alioto used to work in the kitchen at the world-famous French Laundry before opening his first Seven Hills, Zagat’s ""Best Italian Restaurant in the Bay Area,"" and now Nostra Spaghetteria in the Mission District.   Using fresh from the market local and seasonal ingredients, and making everything by hand, from mixing dough and cutting pasta with a knife to cooking a variety of delectable sauces from scratch, the kitchen at Nostra Spaghetteria extends its courtesy to allow for diner’s initiative. While the regular menu features old spaghetti favorites and newly popular dishes, the additional “custom pasta menu” lists nine kinds of handmade pasta, including a gluten-free variety; 10 house-made sauces (like arrabbiata, creamy tomato, white wine & garlic); eight veggie options (mushrooms, English peas, summer squash, etc.) and nine proteins from shrimp to turkey meatballs. If my school math memory serves me right this list of ingredients provides near infinite amount of possibilities for creating your own pasta dishes every day of the year for many-many years! For our first dinner at Nostra (“ours” in Italian) my dining companion and I picked several of the chef-recommended “simple dishes.” Grilled Octopus antipasto with heirloom cannellini beans, cherry tomato, frisee salad, and lemon vinaigrette was beautifully plated and perfectly balanced in tastes and textures. Raviolo al Uovo primo with parmesan cheese, Bloomsdale spinach, homemade ricotta cheese, brown butter, and truffle oil presented a rather substantial and easily shareable mama-dumpling topped with a soft cooked egg and stuffed to the brim with a delicious mixture of silky cheese and chewy greens. Another primo, which I wouldn’t think of ordering, but only because [uninitiated] I didn’t know better, was called Cold Spaghetti, and presented a hockey puck of tangled tender pasta in a pool of fresh heirloom tomato puree (just tomatoes and olive oil), topped with young pea shoots and sprinkled with micro greens. (When I peered into the open kitchen I saw those microgreens and other herbs grown in shallow boxes next to the prep table. Not a bad idea – a kitchen garden right in the kitchen! They can’t get fresher than that…) Then we finished our wonderful cocktails – Monkeys in Manhattan from Amaro Cocktails list, and Strawberry Basil Gimlet from House Cocktails – prepared by the Lead Bar Manager, Adam Mardigras, and the fun began! We asked our server and Sommelier Chevis Scott to recommend some wine for our customized pasta dishes we were about to consume. From a long list of sophisticated international labels compiled by the Master Sommelier Nunzio Alioto, he picked the utterly pleasing Sicilian Planeta, Cerasuolo di Vittoria (Nero d’Avola & Frappato Blend), and suggested we don’t go heavy-handed on creating our own pasta dishes, which was a great advice! I picked thin ribbons of tarjin pasta, substantial veal ragu sauce, and my favorite vegetable – eggplant. My husband picked light and airy gnocchi, basil pesto, and oxtail meat. Both our custom-made pastas turned out to be incredibly delicious, which was easily explained by the utmost freshness and the immediacy of preparation of all ingredients.     When it came time for dessert, we were actually full, but couldn’t resist Chef Alex’s Buttermilk Panna Cotta with Birbet wine gelee, nicely complimented by the sweet Moscato d’Asti from Piedmont. The contemporary “casual chic” design of the dining room and bar includes comfy tables and booths, a large-scale mural from local artist, Chris Lux, a few industrial accents, and bare Edison lamps of various forms and sizes. Reclaimed wood from a torn down barn, spotted in Half Moon Bay by the Chef’s mom, adds to the family feel of this tasteful and friendly place. Nostra Spaghetteria is located at 280 Valencia Street, San Francisco. Dinner 5:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Tuesday – Thursday and Sunday and 5:30 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. Friday and Saturday. Brunch on Sunday 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Bar Mia is open Tuesday – Saturday 3:00 p.m. to midnight and Sunday 3:00 p.m. – 10:00 p.m. with a special happy hour Tuesday – Sunday 3:00 p.m to 7:00 p.m. and late-night 10:00 p.m. – midnight Tuesday - Saturday.

Varian's new Developer Cloud houses digital tools like information about TrueBeam® Developer Mode, and cloud-based applications for managing Developer Mode and simulating treatments. It is part of the company's overall objective to empower research-oriented clinical teams to accelerate the development of new treatment techniques and processes designed to improve outcomes for cancer patients. 

""When Varian introduced the TrueBeam platform in 2010, we included Developer Mode, an optional non-clinical development tool for researchers to use in pioneering and prototyping new treatment techniques,"" said Corey Zankowski 

In a separate development, the OncoPeer online forum, first launched last March in select geographic areas, is now accessible to Varian customers worldwide. Since March, users have established discussion groups on topics like oncology analytics, knowledge-based treatment planning, treatment planning using Eclipse™ software, and the physics of radiotherapy. One discussion group focuses on how to use Varian's ARIA® information system to manage a medical oncology department. Other groups share information about Varian treatment delivery platforms. 

""OncoPeer is a place for customers to find others who use Varian technology and learn from one another,"" said Sukhveer Singh 

Varian held an online seminar about Navigating OncoPeer last May. Interested clinicians can view a replay of the webcast at this registration website. Customers can access OncoPeer at www.oncopeer.com (registration required).

5817,"Bermudian Flora Duffy claimed her second women's world title when she won the Sardegna ITU Cross Triathlon World Championships. 
Duffy, 27, who finished second in last year's race, held in Zittau, Germany, dominated the race and finished in a time of 2 hours 25 minutes and 56 seconds -- almost four minutes faster than Barbara Riveros of Chile, who finished second, here on Saturday, reports CMC. 
Brigitta Poor of Hungary came third in 2:38:10, while the defending champion, Kathrin Muller of Germany, finished 13th in 2:48:46. 

Duffy dominated the five-kilometre swim and had an advantage of almost 1.30 over Riveros before working alone to extend her lead in the 31-kilometre bike -- her strongest discipline. 

Duffy, who won the bronze medal at the Pan Am Games in Toronto in July, made light work of the muddy off-road tracks with the fastest time in the 9.6-kilometre run -- 38.35 -- to secure the title. 

Duffy's first world title came when she won the Xterra World Championships in Maui, Hawaii, last year.

6768,"SHAUN Maloney has been backed to provide the magic touch in Hull City's midfield when returning to Championship action at home to Blackburn Rovers tomorrow. 

Maloney made his full debut in Tuesday night's 1-0 win over Swansea City in the Capital One Cup, enhancing his prospects of a first league start for the Tigers with an accomplished performance. 

The 32-year-old, signed from MLS side Chicago Fire last month, was at the creative hub of City's latest home victory, linking play stylishly and helping set up David Meyler's winning goal. 

It was the first real glimpse of Maloney's talents after shaking off a recent hamstring injury and manager Steve Bruce believes the playmaker's experience can inject a spark into his side. 

""I thought he was excellent,"" said Bruce. ""He'll give us something different that we'll benefit from. 

""He's a really clever footballer who gets himself in little areas and retains the ball. He takes us forward, too. We have to play on the front foot more. 

""We had a very young team against Swansea and the easy thing to do is go backwards. 

""We've got to have a belief about us that we can go forward and create chances. We shouldn't be frightened about making a mistake. 

""We've got a lot of young players learning their trade. Shaun Maloney can be that little bit of experience, which some of them will need. I'm sure he'll help Robbo (Andy Robertson), in particular."" 

Against a Blackburn side who have won just one of their eight Championship fixtures to date, City will be favourites to continue their promotion bid with a victory tomorrow. 

Gary Bowyer's men ended their search for a win when beating Charlton 3-0 last weekend, but they remain without an away victory since early April. 

Blackburn's visit will be City's fifth game in 15 days and recalls are expected for Michael Dawson, Mohamed Diame, Tom Huddlestone and Abel Hernandez.",0668fb4f-01b8-4a21-b8dd-b5ab7083a492,News,2015-09-25T06:05:00Z,Hull Daily Mail,Shaun Maloney 'magic touch' can boost Hull City – Steve...,0.0,Blog

8611,"Pangako Sayo September 22 2015
Pangako Sa ’Yo is a 2015 Philippine romantic melodrama television series based on the 2000 Filipino soap opera of the same title. Directed by Rory Quintos, Dado Lumibao, Cathy Garcia-Molina and Olivia M. Lamasan. Top-billed by Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla with Jodi Sta. Maria and Angelica Panganiban . The series premiered on ABS-CBN and worldwide on The Filipino Channel on May 25, 2015, succeeding Forevermore.
A 'Modern retelling of a great Filipino love story', the story revolves on the lives of Amor de Jesus, Eduardo Buenavista and Claudia Salameda; and their children Yna Macaspac and Angelo Buenavista whose lives are intertwined because of Love, Poverty, Power and Vengeance.
The story revolves on young lovers Yna Macaspac (Kathryn Bernardo) and Angelo Buenavista (Daniel Padilla), who believes that they were half-siblings. Angelo, the rebellious son of a powerful politician, falls in love with Yna, a simple but beautiful adopted daughter of a retired policeman. Unbeknownst to them, their love story is destined to repeat history. 20 years ago, Angelo's father, Eduardo Buenavista (Ian Veneracion), also fell in love with an innocent but headstrong barrio lass named Amor (Jodi Sta. Maria). But their relationship was doomed from the start. Eduardo's mother, Doña Benita (Pilar Pilapil), despised Amor, as she was an impediment to her plan to marry her son to Claudia (Angelica Panganiban), the illegitimate daughter of Governor Salameda (Leo Rialp). The arranged marriage would have saved their family business, and so Benita did everything to ensure that that happened. And so despite the lovers’ struggle to fight for their love, they eventually succumb to the pressures and machinations. Eduardo is made to believe that Amor betrayed him, by having a relationship with his brother, Diego (Bernard Palanca). And so when Amor tells him she was actually a victim of rape by Diego, Eduardo refused to believe her. He sends her off and marries Claudia Salameda. Amor then tries to forget everything that happened between her and Eduardo. Eventually, she finds out that she is pregnant. Years after giving birth, Amor decides to leave for Hong Kong to be a domestic helper. It is where she finds out that the mining village, Talimpao, was devastated after an earthquake. Doomed by the death of her family and her own daughter Maria Amor (who is later Yna Macaspac), Amor vows to seek vengeance to all of those who oppressed her. Tested by fate and hardened by suffering, Amor returns 20 years later, and her day of reckoning comes. She crosses paths with Eduardo and Claudia, and their son, Angelo, whom Amor sees will play the biggest role in her revenge. Ironically, crossing Angelo means crossing Yna, his inamorata. Unbeknownst to Amor, crossing Yna Macaspac will lead her to the greatest tragedy of her life; greater than what has befallen her in the past.

3142,"50 years later, is it time to retract a retraction by a Nobel prize-winning author?with one commentGeorg Wittig It’s not often that an article is retracted only to be later proven correct. But that may have happened this past summer in the chemistry literature. In July, a group of researchers recapitulated an experiment largely similar to one that Nobelist Georg Wittig had performed – and subsequently retracted — decades earlier. Their findings suggest Wittig may actually have gotten it right the first time. On July 27, Peter Chen of ETH Zurich and colleagues published an article online in the journal Angewandte Chemie International Edition that describes a new method for appending a carbon atom to an unsaturated hydrocarbon to create a three-membered ring – a useful chemical transformation known as cyclopropanation. Yet, it was not the first time researchers had reported such a process. As Chen and his colleagues note in the Israel Journal of Chemistry, Georg Wittig of the Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg (who would go on to win the chemistry Nobel Prize in 1979) and Volker Franzen reported a similar reaction in 1960 in Angewandte Chemie, a German-language publication. But when Wittig asked student Dietlinde Krauss to replicate the findings, she “could not reproduce the 1960 results under any set of conditions,” Chen and his team wrote in the Israel Journal of Chemistry, and, in 1964: Wittig explicitly retracted the claim. That “retraction” is not a retraction per se. Authored by Krauss and Wittig, but not Franzen, it was published in a separate German-language journal called Justus Liebigs Annalen der Chemie, which subsequently was folded into the European Journal of Organic Chemistry. In that article, Krauss and Wittig write in a footnote (as translated by Google), “The findings of V. Franzen and G. Wittig … could therefore not be confirmed.” Chen characterized the 1964 article to Retraction Watch as a “repudiation.” And in a subsequent email, he wrote: If you read what Wittig writes in 1964, it is a retraction because he disavows the work explicitly. Whatever you call it, the fact remains that after 1964, the paper effectively disappeared. Chen and his team stumbled upon it as they were developing their own method for cyclopropanation. Although they were disappointed to find out they’d been scooped, Chen told Retraction Watch he was surprised to see that the 1960 paper had essentially fallen off the chemistry world’s radar. As he and his colleagues write in IJC: There have been no further publications following up the 1960 Franzen and Wittig Angewandte Chemie Communication after 1964, so definitive was the final judgment by Wittig. According to Chen, this assertion reflects the reference tool, SciFinder. According to Web of Science, the 1960 article has been cited 47 times, most recently — other than by Chen — in 1996, and only 13 times since 1970. Importantly, however, said Chen, none of these papers actually “follow up the work.” Presumably, Wittig had this tremendous reputation, that his experimentals always worked. And when he said it doesn’t work, then everybody took it at face value that it doesn’t work. How then to explain the original report? There were but two possibilities, Chen told us: Either Wittig’s co-author was “lying outright,” or the experiment had, in fact, worked the first time. Assuming the latter, the team then set about determining why it might have worked once and then not again. The reaction detailed by Chen exhibits what he calls  “sort of a weird set of conditions.” Among other things, the reaction requires a nickel catalyst at a specific concentration, and a sealed container. It isn’t possible, of course, to know what did or didn’t happen decades ago, but it seems “eminently plausible that Franzen’s experiment worked because of adventitious nickel,” Chen said. It’s not actually that hard for nickel to infiltrate a reaction, Chen noted. Catalysts often are active at very low concentrations. Nickel  is a known impurity of lithium, which is used in the reaction. It also is found in steel, and could have leached out during incubations with acid in the procedure. Even today, trace metal impurities can be remarkably hard to detect and eliminate. “Wittig was obviously a bright guy,” Chen said: He got the Nobel Prize for heaven’s sake. But he was not looking for a metal-catalyzed reaction. Chen’s team, though, was looking. So we were more primed to find this solution, which they never thought of. But it still took his team five years to hit upon the right combination of catalyst and conditions to make everything work. Since Wittig and Krauss didn’t realize the reaction needed nickel to proceed, however, they couldn’t replicate the reaction and assumed it was incorrect. John Montgomery, the Margaret and Herman Sokol Professor in Medicinal or Synthetic Chemistry at the University of Michigan, an expert in nickel chemistry, told us that this missing catalyst could certainly have foiled reproducibility efforts: The unusual nickel concentration requirements described by Chen would certainly add to irreproducibilities from batch to batch of the reagents employed at the time. I credit Franzen and Wittig for issuing the retraction since all they knew at the time was that the process could not be reproduced. And he said that such things have happened before: … you could draw parallel to the Nozaki Hiyama Kishi (NHK) coupling reaction, which is a significant named reaction originally found to be irreproducible when CrCl2 was used. But later it was found that nickel contaminants were required to promote the reaction. It is now a widely used synthetic method that routinely uses very low levels of nickel to promote catalysis. It is unfortunate that Franzen and Wittig were not able conduct trace metal analysis of their reagents to look for this type of source of the irreproducibility. So does that mean it’s time to retract the 1964 retraction? Chen doesn’t think so. The work done in the 1964 paper is not wrong; Krauss just never got the right combination. Her reports are accurate and well documented, but they never considered that the reaction could have been catalyzed. In their IJC essay, Chen and his team lay out several lessons they took from the experience: For one, don’t neglect the “old” literature in favor of more recent synopses: There are jewels buried in the literature, and it takes reading of the original, primary publications to dig them out. Also: Consider what it means to get negative results. Evidence that something does not work is no proof that it cannot work. Finally, they write: Critically question what your professors say. The education of a scientist is successful when he or she exercises reason and creativity to form an opinion despite what authority says must be true. Science is ultimately self-correcting.

3560,"Would you like to find out what those-in-the-know have to say about CNC Woodworking? The information in the article below comes straight from well-informed experts with special knowledge about CNC Woodworking. 
 
CNC woodworking machine is important in woodwork industry, especially if you are planning to expand or there is an increase in customer demands.  For those who have been doing woodwork manually, the price of CNC equipment may be surprising and the costs of upgrading the system may cause some serious dent on your savings.  Would there be another way of increasing productivity without spending too much? 
 
There is a good alternative for buying new CNC woodwork, buying used ones.  It may sound ridiculous, but very practical. There are several second-hand equipments that are still in a good condition but up for a lower price.  Buying used CNC woodworking machines is a good option for those who have tight budget. 
 
There are several things to think about before buying a previously-used CNC woodworking machine. 
 
Understand your needs.  Make sure that you will be getting an equipment that would best fit the demands of your woodworking business.  For example, if you need a CNC router for a small scale business, then you are not buying a warehouse scale CNC router.  Aside from that fact that you will not be maximizing the potential of the machine, it would cost you more than you need to spend. 
 
Check the machine background.  Background check would include previous maintenance and machine problems and its service records.  This would give you an idea, if the machine would still be able to meet your expectations when it comes to woodwork.  If the machine is not properly maintained, then it may cause you serious problems in terms of production and may end up spending more in repairs and replacement. 
 
So far, we’ve uncovered some interesting facts about CNC Woodworking. You may decide that the following information is even more interesting. 
 
Check the brand name.  The benefit of choosing a branded used machine is that machine services that the manufacturer offers. Aside from that, branded machines also tend to be durable. It is important to look for brands that already have a good reputation when it comes to durability, efficiency and quality. 
 
Ask the owner if the equipment is still covered with maintenance and warranty.  You would like to take advantage of such benefits. 
 
Don’t forget to negotiate.  There are some sellers who would sell a machine in much higher price, negotiate and try to get it for the actual or reasonable price. 
 
Before buying anything, make sure to do all research possible.  The internet is a great way to check and compare prices, brand performance and customer feedbacks.  You could check company sites and other businesses if they are selling their older models.  Some would sell because they are upgrading their production, closing down or relocating. 
 
Aside from that, local newspapers and hardware stores would often have listings of equipment up for sale.  Check local woodworkers if they are thinking of changing or selling their equipment. 
 
Proper maintenance of your CNC woodworking equipment goes a long, long, way. Even if you have used CNC equipment, it does not necessarily mean that its lifespan would be cut immediately.  As long as it is properly maintained, it could be in its top/best condition for a long time. 
 
It never hurts to be well-informed with the latest on CNC Woodworking. Compare what you’ve learned here to future articles so that you can stay alert to changes in the area of CNC Woodworking.

  Interventional pulmonologist Dr. Jed Gorden reviews malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) are a common complication of lung cancer and some other cancers. Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 3:28 — 36.9MB) Download Transcript How Did You Like This Video?
Please feel free to offer comments and raise questions in our Discussion Forums.   Transcript So, I wanted to talk to you today about pleural effusions. Pleural effusions — it’s a complex term, and it’s a very common problem, so let’s just break these terms down into what they mean. So, pleura is the lining of the lungs — when I conceptualize this, I think about the lung as going to the grocery store and getting your groceries in a double plastic bag, and the fluid, which is the effusion part of pleural effusion, doesn’t live in the lung, it lives in between these two plastic bags. So, when we’re talking about people who develop pleural effusions, we’re really talking about fluid that resides outside of the lung, and we need to manage that because it becomes a real significant symptom burden for people. Now, it’s a very common problem that people get, it doesn’t have to be associated with cancer. You may know people that have heart failure, or people that have kidney disease, or people who have other problems, people who get pneumonia — many different people are subjected to fluid that builds up around the lung, but what’s common to these people is that, number one, we need to figure out what they have, and number two, we need to figure out what we’re going to do about it and how we’re going to manage it so that people can live independent lives. So within this double plastic bag scenario, fluid builds up. As that fluid builds up, what it’s doing is actually pushing the lung out of the way, and that’s where these symptoms that people may be feeling are coming from — that’s where that shortness of breath comes from. The common symptoms that people experience when they have pleural effusions are shortness of breath, cough, people can have what’s called positional changes, meaning that when you lay down you cough more or are more short of breath, or when you lean over to tie your shoes, you may be more short of breath or you may cough more. It’s purely the fact that the fluid is free in this bag and it can move around, and that irritates the lung. As the fluid builds up more, the lung shrinks more; as the fluid builds up even more, the lung gets even smaller, and this is where a lot of the shortness of breath comes from.  Now, within this space, people can have a free-flowing pleural fluid collection — a large volume of pleural fluid that builds up and displaces the lung. People can also get complex pleural spaces, and that’s where the fluid is still in the lung, but instead of being a free-flowing fluid that pushes the lung around, now you have these organized bands that build up in the pleural space, and sort of pockets of fluid here and pockets of fluid there. This is just another manifestation of fluid that can build up around the lung. But the common denominator of all of these scenarios in the lung, is that the patients will typically present short of breath, and shortness of breath is something that you should tell your physician about because it is incumbent upon us to find ways to identify why you’re short of breath, to make that shortness of breath better, and to find a way for people to live independent and productive lives without this pleural fluid being a principle burden for them.

5893,"Some players come in with plenty of hype, but never quite seem to match it. Others have a great season, then slip the following one, leaving many to wonder if they were one-year wonders. Still others have to bounce back from injury and show they aren't shells of what they used to be. 

Either way, there are plenty of players in the Pac-12 with something to prove in 2015. Here are six players with something to prove from the Pac-12 South. 

Arizona 

We’re not taking the easy way out by picking quarterback Anu Solomon , because if you followed some of the team buzz going into spring ball, there were some calls for a quarterback competition despite a very solid redshirt freshman campaign from Solomon. His numbers tailed at the end of last season -- partially because of injury, but wear-and-tear probably had something to do with it. The coaching staff believes he’s the guy for the next three years. And they are looking to him to earn it. 

Arizona State 

Graduate transfer Devin Lucien has seen the rise of the ASU-UCLA rivalry. Now the wide receiver is going to be on the other side of it in an offense that just so happens to be looking for depth at the position. Last season with the Bruins he caught 29 balls for 225 yards and a pair of touchdowns.  Now a Sun Devil, the coaches think he’s a good one-year fit for Mike Norvell’s tempo offense. He’s listed as a starter opposite converted running back DJ Foster, so he’ll have an opportunity to prove himself to his new coaches and teammates immediately. 

Colorado 

Linebacker Addison Gillam was on Scooby Wright III -type pace when they both were freshmen. But injuries and illness slowed him down in 2014 and his weight even dropped to below 200 pounds. He’s back up to 225 and listed as a starter. In 2013 he posted 119 tackles, including three sacks and seven for a loss in what was one of the finest freshman seasons for a Colorado defensive player. He’s out to regain his freshman form and show he wasn’t just a one-year wonder. 

UCLA 

Kenny Young had himself a pretty good season last year at middle linebacker. Tallying 58 tackles (5.5 for a loss) is nothing to scoff at. But when you’ve got Eric Kendricks on the other side, winning the Butkus Award and recording 149 tackles, it’s easy to get overlooked. This year, he's the new Kendricks, and will be asked to be the primary run stopper. There are good edge rushers, a stout defensive front eating up blockers for him, and Myles Jack is inside, but will also have more coverage responsibilities. The potential is there for big numbers. 

USC 

The defensive backfield looks pretty stacked, and should be a strength for the Trojans. Safety Chris Hawkins could bring it all together. A converted cornerback who posted 32 tackles last season, including one for a loss and an interception, Hawkins started the first four games last season. He was moved to safety in the spring and impressed enough to get back into the starting rotation at strong safety. The coaching staff made the right call last year moving Su'a Cravens from safety to linebacker. This move could prove equally beneficial. 

Utah 

Spoiler alert: We’re dummies sometimes. We look at Trevor Reilly and say he was only productive because of the presence of Star Lotulelei . And Nate Orchard was only productive because of Reilly. And Hunter Dimick was only productive because of Orchard. It’s a vicious cycle. So with all due respect and apologies to Mr. Dimick, there are a lot of people eager to see if he can replicate last season's success (10 sacks, 14.5 tackles for a loss) as the go-to guy on the defensive front. But that could also mean fewer sacks and TFLs since he’ll be drawing more attention. He’s cool with that.",9972f878-9d52-4f94-8bef-996d7425dba0,News,2015-09-01T18:05:38Z,ESPN.com,Something to prove: Pac-12 South,0.0,Blog
1679,"SAN MATEO, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 09/22/15 --  According to Franklin Templeton's 2015 Retirement Income Strategies and Expectations (RISE) survey , Americans who work with a financial advisor are much more likely to have already begun saving for retirement, compared to those who have never worked with an advisor (93 percent versus 54 percent). The annual survey, which polled more than 2,000 Americans, found that nearly half of those who have never worked with a financial advisor have no retirement savings, and nearly one-quarter of pre-retirees who have never worked with an advisor never plan to retire. 

""People should absolutely take an active approach when it comes to retirement planning, and financial advisors can help,"" said Michael Doshier, vice president of retirement marketing for Franklin Templeton Investments. ""Our survey results clearly demonstrate the critical role financial advisors play in empowering their clients to become active participants in both financial and emotional retirement preparation. Advisors can provide the necessary tools and support their clients' need to be smart, engaged investors, which ultimately leads to their greater sense of security in the time leading up to and during retirement."" 

 Preparing for What's Next  

Financial advisors can both increase retirement preparedness and help clients align their retirement expectations with reality. 

According to the survey, pre-retired Americans who have never worked with a financial advisor are more than twice as likely to answer ""don't know"" when asked what percentage of their current income they expect to live on in retirement, compared to those who work with a financial advisor (49 percent versus 20 percent). In addition, pre-retirees who have never worked with a financial advisor are nearly twice as likely as those who work with an advisor to feel the most likely cause of a retirement delay would be because they believe they do not have enough money saved (42 percent versus 24 percent). 

Financial advisors can also help investors better understand how Social Security can fit into their retirement income plans and when to initiate their benefits. In fact, nearly three-quarters (72 percent) of those who work with a financial advisor indicate they are confident that their Social Security benefits will provide expected income in retirement, much higher compared to those who have never worked with an advisor (58 percent). 

Similarly, those who work with a financial advisor are also more likely to express confidence that their workplace retirement plan (77 percent) and personal investments (89 percent) will provide expected income in retirement, compared to those who have never worked with an advisor (both 58 percent). 

 Living in Retirement  

In the same way that financial advisors can facilitate preparation and reinforce a fundamental understanding of retirement-related issues leading up to retirement, they can also enable their clients to experience a retirement reality that aligns with their expectations. 

More than half (59 percent) of retired Americans who work with a financial advisor say they have spending habits that are similar to their expectations, while only 40 percent of those who have never worked with an advisor can say the same. 

Working with a financial advisor helps with addressing many fundamental concerns surrounding day-to-day life during retirement. For those who have never worked with a financial advisor, their top concern during retirement is running out of money (32 percent). Americans who work with an advisor cite health and medical issues (37 percent) as their top concern. 
 
At the same time, affording medical expenses appears to be less of a concern for those who work with a financial advisor -- with more than three-quarters (77 percent) indicating that they know how they will pay for medical expenses in retirement -- than those who do not work with an advisor (just 40 percent of whom know how they will pay). 

 Reducing Stress  

Those who work with a financial advisor appear to exhibit less stress in response to normal short-term market volatility. For example, two-thirds (67 percent) indicate that they would not worry if their retirement investments declined by 5 percent, compared to 53 percent of their counterparts who have never worked with an advisor. 

""Understanding market mechanics and structuring your portfolio to weather ups and downs are vital to your peace of mind in retirement. Those lacking access to an advisor and sound investment guidance generally experience more stress surrounding natural market moves and the implications on their personal investments,"" said Doshier. ""In order to set yourself up for success in retirement, it's important to work with your financial advisor to build an individualized plan that takes your specific needs, expectations and apprehensions into account."" 

 Methodology  

The Franklin Templeton Retirement Income Strategies and Expectations (RISE) survey was conducted online among a sample of 2,002 adults comprising 1,001 men and 1,001 women 18 years of age or older. The survey was administered between January 8 and 22, 2015, by ORC International's Online CARAVAN®, which is not affiliated with Franklin Templeton Investments. Data is weighted to gender, age, geographic region, education and race. The custom-designed weighting program assigns a weighting factor to the data based on current population statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau.

OTTAWA 

Beginning in 1939, hundreds of thousands of young Canadians made their way to recruitment centres to join the fight to preserve the freedom, democracy and rule of law that we hold so dear. Over a million Canadians donned the uniform, each one making some form of sacrifice during that terrible conflict. Forty-five thousand lost their lives, fifty-four thousand were wounded, not counting those who came home but were never fully able to put the ordeal behind them. They did not set out in search of glory or adventure; they simply stood firm in their resolve to carry out the task before them: to defeat a tyrannical regime. 

Let us reaffirm our commitment to preserving the values for which they fought, and let us pay tribute to the determination of our brave soldiers, who gave so much of themselves to bring to a close this dark chapter in our history, 70 years ago.

3257,"HARRISBURG, Pa., Sept. 16, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Pennsylvania Department of Education and Department of State have undertaken a joint initiative to encourage voter registration among eligible students throughout the Commonwealth.

The agencies, along with the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE), are working together to provide a range of voter registration information and guidance to students and staff at high schools, colleges and universities statewide.

""Our message to young people is that voting is central to their participation in our democracy,"" Secretary of State Pedro A. Cortés said. ""We want to instill in our youth the importance of exercising this most basic right of citizenship from the day they become eligible.""

With the recent addition of online voter registration, applicants of every age have more options than ever before. Online voter registration, available at register.votesPA.com, makes the process more convenient, accessible and secure.

""Our schools are now educating the 'technology generation' who have grown up using Internet-based tools and devices,"" Education Secretary Pedro A. Rivera said. ""The online voter registration championed by Governor Wolf and implemented by Secretary Cortés is the latest example of how Pennsylvania is integrating 21st century technology in state government, and will help spark civic engagement in our students.""

While a voter must be 18 in order to cast a ballot, applicants can register in advance if they will turn 18 by Election Day. With that in mind, high school teachers are being encouraged to integrate lessons and discussions about voter registration in civics and social studies classes.

The State Library of Pennsylvania, a bureau of the Department of Education, is also participating in the effort by disseminating information to libraries statewide.

PASSHE is encouraging colleges and universities to incorporate on their websites a direct link to the online voter registration site and is helping spread the word about the availability of the new registration option.

""There are more than 100,000 students enrolled at our State System universities across the Commonwealth, the vast majority of whom live in Pennsylvania and will remain here after graduation. They represent Pennsylvania's future, and it is important that they be engaged in their communities,"" PASSHE Chancellor Frank Brogan said.

3666,"A NASTY encounter with a python has left a snake catcher bloody and bruised. 
 
The python bit Lockyer Valley-based snake catcher Andrew Smedley 10 times. 
 
Mr Smedley was called to a house in Esk to reports of a ""big snake"". 
 
Those reports proved spot on. 
 
""Usually when people say they have a big snake I don't take much notice because half the time they exaggerate a bit,"" he said. 
 
""Well, when I went to this job as soon as I saw it I thought 'this python has come from a good paddock'."" 
 
Mr Smedley cornered the python in a green-house - a move he may now regret. 
 
He was bit about 10 times on the arm, leaving his several deep cuts. 
 
""I almost fell and snapped a few bones,"" he said. 
 
""I got the snake eventually but only after it hammered me about 10 times.

4174,"Republicans are concerned that Donald Trump is branding the party as racist . 
 

 
Some party leaders worry that the favorable response Mr. Trump has received from the Republican electorate is luring other candidates to adopt or echo his remarks. It is a pattern, they say, that could tarnish the party’s image among minority voters. 
 
“Any candidate that allows Trump to dictate the conversation about what they’re campaigning on is going to be harmed irreparably,” said Josh Holmes, a Republican strategist and the architect of Senator Mitch McConnell’s re-election campaign in Kentucky last year. “And to the extent that there are mainstream candidates dragged into the musings of Trump on a day-to-day basis is really bad news for us.”

2259,"Accies get their season off the ground at Inverleith 
 

 
Playing all of 0.9 miles away from home, Edinburgh Accies ‘travelled’ to Stewart-Melville’s home ground at Inverleith for their third round match in the BT National League’s Division 1. Stew-Mel came into the match with two wins from two matches while Accies had suffered two losses. According to various sources, however, neither team had played particularly well in the run up to the match, so it was all eyes to the pitch as the referee blew to start the match. 
 
Initially, it looked like a poor start for the visitors as the wind took the kick off beyond Stew-Mel’s dead ball line, forcing a scrum restart from the centre. It was immediately apparent that the home side scrum was in for a long afternoon as they just managed to retain the ball. However, less than two minutes in, the Accies pack turned over the ball from a ruck and, exploiting a gap up the left, wing Neil Armstrong galloped in from 30+ metres for the try. Facundo Beltrami, then stepped up to score with the conversion and Accies were 7-0 ahead. 
 
For the next 20 minutes of the first half, play was fairly evenly distributed between the teams, with Stew-Mel possibly having the territorial advantage, but suffering a couple of turnovers in the process as the bigger Accies pack exerted a bit of dominance. But, ‘evenly distributed’ possession counted for little as Beltramino knocked over two penalties in the period of the match to stretch the visitors lead to 13-0. 
 
Despite the penalty count against Stew-Mel climbing, they did have their own chance at points with just about 10 minutes to play, but, the, usually reliable, boot of Nick McCashin failed, and his attempt just made it across the goal line. From the 22 restart the home side pressed for the next score, but had to settle for a, this time, successful penalty goal from McCashin with about five minutes of the half left. Accies then regained the restart ball and pushed the home side deep, pressure which was rewarded with a successful Beltramino penalty on 40 minutes, so the sides went in 16-3 at the break. 
 
Five minutes into the second half and McCashin pulled back three points for Stew-Mel with a finely struck penalty from distance to close the score up a touch to 16-6. 
 
By this time, the referee was losing patience with Stew-Mel’s penalty count and, with another ruck infringement in the home 22, sub, Neil Bowie, saw yellow and was off for 10 minutes. Accies saw their chance, but their own penalty count was increased by two as they were penalised in a ruck and then again following the penalty lineout. This put Stew-Mel deep in the visiting half, but a dropped ball handed possession back to Accies. 
 
They then used their extra man to great effect and, despite desperate defence from Stew-Mel, they scored their second try from a rolling maul off the top of a five metre lineout, Jamie Sole coming up with the ball. With another successful Beltramino kick, the score had now opened up to 23-6 with just over 20 minutes left to play. 
 
Just as in the first half, the home side found their feet and were easily the better side for the next 10 minutes or so. They came near to scoring down the right, but eventually crossed the line with a fine passing move which saw No. 14, Ross McCann forcing himself over near the left corner. With McCashin’s conversion just shaving the front of the posts, the score remained at 23-11. 
 
Almost chasing down a clearance from the restart saw Stew-Mel inside Accies 22 again, but some fine play had the visitors clear after a few neat moves and deep in the home half. A ruck on the right was badly dealt with by the Stew-Mel defence and Accies no. 6, Alistair Pollock had a virtually clear run in to the line – almost losing his shorts, but displaying a fine line in Edinburgh Accies branded underwear in the process! Once again, Beltramino was on song with his kicking and, with just enough time for the restart, the score was 30-11. 
 
And it was a restart that one Stew-Mel player soon wished had never happened. 
 
With Stew-Mel on the attack, the ball was lost forward and Accies set up to clear. With frustration mounting, one of the Stew-Mel players ‘got in the way’. He was then ‘moved on’ by Accies Swanepoel, but Matt Stevens from the home side saw red, picked up the Accies player and dumped him on his head. Needless to say, this initiated a, thankfully, brief mêlée and the whole thing ‘kicked off’ with players flying in from all angles. When the dust had settled, the referee had no option but to have Stevens literally see red as he carded him following a short conference with his assistant on the touch line. 
 
Accies then cleared the ball to touch to bring, what had been a fairly scrappy match, to a disappointing – for Stew-Mel – conclusion. 
 
Images from the match will appear here over the next few days. As Matt Stevens will, in all likelihood, be facing an SRU disciplinary hearing, images of the incident will be withheld.",0c8d5315-7fed-42ac-80c0-d24cebc45488,News,2015-09-13T12:23:27Z,The Edinburgh Reporter,"Rugby – Stewarts-Melville v Edinburgh Accies, BT National League, Div. 1",0.0,News

CNN has scheduled a phone call at 5 p.m. EDT on Tuesday with the GOP presidential campaigns to discuss changes to the criteria determining which candidates will get to appear on main stage at the next debate later this month, The Washington Times has learned.
The call is the outgrowth of negotiations between CNN and the Republican National Committee, which sanctions the party’s debates, to address concerns raised by the GOP’s only female candidate, Carly Fiorina, that the original criteria wrongly has kept her form the stage even as she is rising in the polls.

4954,"Seeking an end to a longstanding cycle of corruption, FIFA intends to make all presidential candidates pass integrity checks.The plan has been proposed by the head of FIFA's independent audit and compliance committee, Domenico Scala, per Press Association reporter Martyn Ziegler (h/t Daily Mail): ""At the end of the day, it goes down to the merits of the accusations. The ethics committee carries out the integrity checks and we [the election committee] will rely heavily on the assessment of the ethics committee.""This means candidates Chung Mong-Joon, Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein and UEFA's Michel Platini will need to be rubber-stamped by the ethics committee and its checks before they are confirmed worthy to stand for election.Scala is the man tasked with overseeing the next elections for the right to lead world football's governing body. His proposal is clearly intended as an attempt to wipe away some of the stain left by Sepp Blatter's tenure, a period that ended with indictments and the Swiss overseer declaring he'll be stepping down.Ziegler also points to Scala's standing as someone who has pushed for major reforms within FIFA in recent months.Still, face-saving gesture or not, Scala's attempts to at least closely monitor the candidates does represent a small step in the right direction for FIFA.

9811,"How very fitting that the Pope wore green vestments yesterday for his arena Mass on global peace at Madison Square Garden.
It was only the day before that Francis was personally welcomed to Washington, D.C. and the Capitol by John Boehner sporting a green tie, something he had specifically been told to wear by his staff. Through an interpreter, the laughing pope commented, ""The tie is the color of hope."" Boehner replied, ""I need a lot of hope today."" ***** As the Huffington Post website reports on this historic exchange, “Those cameras showed the Ohioan pacing nervously as he waited in his formal office, tugging at his suit buttons and repeatedly adjusting his green tie. “After telling Francis how very glad he was the pontiff could come, Boehner sat down with the Pope for their photo op. And explained his tie. “Boehner said he had wanted to wear an older ceremonial blue tie ‘with the little hands on it,’ but his staff wouldn't let him. "" ‘My staff insisted I wear the green tie,’ Boehner said. “A member of the pope's entourage said the staff chose well. And through his interpreter, the pontiff himself found a way to elevate the mundane moment a bit. "" ‘The tie is the color of hope,’ he said. "" ‘We need a lot of hope today,’ Boehner answered. ***** In a blog post here from 6/13/15, entitled “It’s easy being the Green One,” I referred to an article called “The Green Hope,” written by Dr. Terry Watkins, regarding the New Age perversions in Eugene Peterson’s incredibly successful 2002 bible paraphrase (consistently ranked among the top-five bestselling bibles) called “The Message,” endorsed by such Christian “heavyweights” as Billy Graham, Chuck Swindoll, Rick Warren, Max Lucado, etc., etc. Watkins notes that Romans 15:13 in “The Message” contains “the most bizarre statement ever in a mainstream Bible.” The verse reads, “Oh! May the God of green hope fill you up with joy, fill you up with peace, so that your believing lives, filled with the life-giving energy of the Holy Spirit, will brim over with hope!” This compares to the King James Bible: “Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.” Watkins writes, “Who is the ‘God of green hope’? The ‘green hope’ originated with the hellish, human sacrificing, Druids. The publication Talks on Freemasonry states, ‘Green was, with the Druids, a symbol of hope and the virtue of hope with a Freemason illustrates the hope of immortality.’ (Kenneth Tuckwood, Talks on Freemasonry). “The ‘green hope’ mantra is a popular rallying cry in the new age Mother-Earth environmental movement. In the New Age Movement, ‘green’ signifies ‘Oneness with the Earth,’ hence the title of William Anderson’s book, ‘Green Man: The Archetype of Our Oneness with the Earth.’ ” Watkins references page 159 of the “Dictionary of Symbolism,” considered the most comprehensive one-volume work on the language of symbols ever published, in which author Hans Biedermann notes:  “. . . the devil appears as ‘the green one’. . .” ***** One of things people love most about the Pope is they believe he has supernatural “connections” that can directly influence their lives. It comes out of the imagination that says there’s something in all the Catholic hoodleedoo; there’s something in the supernatural that you can’t see except if you come and do it exactly the way they do it. Followers of the icons, rituals, dead saints, etc., etc., try and get something out of the supernatural into their natural life. “The symbols, the allegories, the imaginations that the world is so full of are designed simply to promote the Lie program,” said Jordan in a recent sermon on man’s religions. “What does Satan tell Eve in the Garden? ‘There’s something that God knows that He doesn’t want you to know that I can tell you, and when you do, you get in contact with the supernatural; you’ll get in contact with something that’s bigger than you are.’ “In witchcraft, for example, you’re communicating with the spiritual world, trying to get something out of it. Well, Satan has a plan, an enticement to get you involved in that and it’s this hidden stuff. “Now, God makes it all known. In Isaiah 14, when Satan’s original intent is identified for you, his original plan and strategy, there’s a five-point goal he sold to the other angelic host. Satan started at the top echelon and worked his way down. ***** “You’ve got a worldwide system that’s developing around that curse. An education system, a social system, an economic system, a political system . . . and now we’re ‘casting off the bands that God’s established.’ “When you study marketing, the whole idea is creating a need in someone they didn’t know they have yet. There are hidden meanings in all of merchandising. It’s all done subtly. “What did Satan do? He created a need in others for him, but was the need real?! No, he had to trick them. He had to have a ‘secret’ reason for doing things to entice them in. “When Satan comes to attack Eve, she doesn’t even have the basic knowledge of what God told Adam. Now whose fault would that have been? Adam didn’t do his job very well. “In Verse 4. That’s just a flat-out lie. But she’s not equipped to handle that because her knowledge base isn’t accurate. Here’s why it’s a lie: ‘for god doth know.’ God knows something you don’t know, Eve, that in the day that th “In the quote Satan gives to Eve, if you read the words there are 46 words. When you see that phrase ‘your eyes shall be opened,’ the word ‘eye’ is the 33rd word in the quote. “ ‘And ye shall be as gods knowing.’ God’s got a secret knowledge out here, Eve, and He’s not telling you about it, but if you’re one of the initiated, you’ll know it. “Thirty-three in the Bible is a number associated with illumination. You ever read in the occult about the third eye? You ever seen people going around with a third dot on top of their forehead or a little jewel up there? It’s said to be an ‘eye of perception.’ This is the ability to see into something and have knowledge that you couldn’t have any other way. It’s secret knowledge that you can only have IF you are in the initiated. “Where you got to go to be initiated? Satan’s offering it to Eve: ‘I know something that God doesn’t want you to know and you can’t know unless you become ONE with me.’ “Ultimately when the Antichrist and the system that brings him to power is manifested, it’s that MYSTERY (Mystery Babylon the Great). There is a secret purpose; this idea of secret wisdom and hidden understanding, and the gain you can get if you get it, that’s associated with Satan all the way through the Bible. It’s associated with his Lie program. “What do you say about a lie? A lie can be 98 percent truth but it’s the two percent that isn’t that kills you. You see, it’s the tares are hidden with the wheat kind of a thing. The Lie program is all this good, good, good, but there’s that secret thing in it. ***** “Isaiah 33:6 is a verse I used to keep posted on my wall: 'And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, and strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD is his treasure. ' If you want the nation to be filled with judgment and righteousness, here it is. “When you sit down today and you talk to someone out in the world, you have to start be teaching them the ABCs. Most of you were raised in a culture where everybody knew what the ABCs were. They might not have believed them, but they had a knowledge base in spiritual Bible things that people today don’t have. “In Hosea 4:6 he told Israel ‘my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge,’ and it wasn’t because they couldn’t calculate and make chariots and build buildings. It was knowledge of God. They didn’t have the basic building-block information. “Knowledge is important. Eve didn’t have the knowledge even straight in her thinking, so when Satan came along and offered her this SECRET knowledge, she couldn’t say ‘NO, I know what the truth is.’ She’s over there dreaming up stuff, leaving stuff out—where’d she get that stuff about ‘I can’t touch it,’ for example? She made that up in her imagination. “Notice in Deuteronomy 29:29, with God talking to Israel through Moses, everything you need to know to do everything God has for you to do, He revealed to them. ****** “Genesis 5:6 says, ‘And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.’ “That expression ‘the imagination of his thoughts,’ you have to understand there are the two sides of the way you think. You have a part of your thinking process that thinks thoughts. It’s the logical side where there’s facts and understanding. “It’s two plus two equals four. It’s the way you understand things and it’s reason. That’s the realm of your thinking where truth resides, where reality resides, where the facts are ‘this is the way it is.’ That’s the part of your thinking that’s designed to be in CONTROL. “You also have an imagination. That’s the creative side of your thinking. That’s the part where you have entrepreneurial kind of ideas. That’s where you have the pictures and you can see yourself doing this or see yourself doing that. You can see something bigger than what reality is. “Poetry and the arts come from there, that kind of thing. Now, that side of your life is where the Lie dwells. Because when you’re thinking something that’s not there, not on the table yet, it can be a good thing, something you can accomplish . . . I often think about people who paint. They put the canvas up there and they see something. A sculptor sees something in a big piece of marble; he just gets rid of all the trash around it. “The creative side can be good but that’s also the side where the Lie exists. That’s the part of your thinking where the Lie system gets its hook.” ***** ""That word 'vanity' in Romans 8:20 ( 'For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope') means ‘empty.’   ""When all the substance is gone out of it, you create a vacuum. Satan comes along and says, ‘I’ve got a plan,’ and it’s sucked right in. People think they’re wise but they’ve become fools. “Satan knows that every time you choose verse 21 (‘they glorified him not as God’), they say, ‘He’s not going to be the one who runs things; I’m going to be the one.’ Now whose philosophy did you just follow? You just bought into Satan’s Lie. You just said your ideas are better than God’s ideas and your ‘truth’ is better than God’s truth. “The Lie is you can do it your way: ‘I’ll run my life.’ You know what that is? That’s an imagination.

3488,"For a woman, her wedding day is the most crucial one in her life. How can a bride retain the most attractive and charming appearance on the day of the wedding after struggling with numerous preparations and handling the small particulars of the wedding day? 
 
The steps below can make it extremely simple for you to turn into an awesome bride! 
 
What is the Best time to Begin Wedding Day Preparations? 
 
The earlier the better! But how do you define early? Actually, it is an everyday responsibility of each woman to care for her skin. It is recommendable that you begin special skin care as well as treatment six to twelve months prior to your wedding day. 
 
Normally, the couple visits the studio for shooting of wedding photos; this is the reason you should begin your skin care early as well as treatment, to ensure you appear great in the photo. 
 
Be Cautious of What You Consume 
 
Being careful of what you consume is extremely vital as it may have a huge impact on the appearance of your skin. Avoid eating excess deep fried meals; rather, opt for more steamed food and vegetables. You will discover that on your wedding day your skin appears revitalized. 
 
You should have breakfast each day and consume less at dinner time. Also, avoid having meals four hours prior to going to bed. It is vital to drink a lot of water and keep away from alcoholic beverages. 
 
Work Out Often 
 
Exercise not only improves your body shape for the fitting and gown; it is also great for the circulation of your blood and it raises the metabolism. You appear more attractive and energetic. 
 
A lot of workouts exist which you can perform. The most successful one is visiting a physician to obtain professional work out. In addition, you can work out with your fiancé to motivate each other. If you are extremely busy working, you can simply exercise by walking up the stairs rather than taking the lift or elevator. 
 
Have Regular Facial Treatment 
 
Visit a beauty centre you have faith in and begin regular facial treatment. Allow the experts to take care of your skin and assist to handle your skin issue immediately. This would be more ideal than panicking due to a pimple on your face some days prior to your wedding. When you begin facial treatment early, this facilitates more time for the recovery of your skin from any facial scars. 
 
Take Note of How You Remove Make-up 
 
Removing your everyday make-up is totally crucial. Residues are harmful to your skin. If possible, avoid make-up prior to your wedding day so as to provide your skin with sufficient time to rest and rejuvenate. 
 
Hair Styling, Make-Up and Dressing 
 
Get in touch with your make-up artist as well as hair stylist as early as you can. Inform them of any skin issues you have and each of your requirements. It would be ideal if you could find a hair stylist who is also a make-up artist as this minimizes the danger of misunderstanding. Experiment with diverse hair styles and make-up prior to your wedding day, so you can find the what hairstyle and makeup give you the most attractive look. 
 
Finding a right bridal gown too is very important. JVSDress recently published a survey that concluded that most women find it very hard to select a white wedding gown that really fits their personality. Make sure that you start your search several days prior to wedding and try to get as many opinions as possible while choosing a perfect dress for your big day. 
 
Relax 
 
A lot of pressures are involved when arranging your wedding. Disagreements and arguments might crop up among your family or even between you and your fiancé. It is extremely vital for you to be aware of how to let go of all the stress and speak to someone. A massage while you are having facial treatment will assist you to let go of the stress. A spa would be ideal also. Resting is the most helpful lotion to facilitate the youthful look of your skin. Get a number of friends to assist you in each of the preparation work. Do not allow each small detail to stress you. 
 
The most vital work for you is to turn into the loveliest bride on the day of your wedding!",b6c31b46-45d4-4940-a6bf-375451e47f3b,News,2015-09-06T21:12:50Z,Examiner.com,A guide on becoming a gorgeous and most exquisite bride on your wedding day,0.0,News

605,"New York (AFP) - Rock legends The Rolling Stones have decided to record a new album in what would be their first in a decade, guitarist Keith Richards said.

Richards, at an event Tuesday evening to promote his latest solo album, said that the Stones planned to return to the studio after a hitherto unannounced tour of South America in early 2016.

""Actually, I was in London last week and the boys and I got together. And, yeah, there are now definite plans to record,"" Richards told a forum in New York organized by Internet radio station iHeartRadio.

The now septuagenarian rockers have toured actively in recent years, recently completing a summer swing through North America, but have not released a new album since ""A Bigger Bang"" in 2005.

That album, in turn, was the first by The Rolling Stones in eight years.

The Rolling Stones are widely regarded as one of rock's defining acts, producing classic albums such as ""Sticky Fingers"" and ""Exile on Main St."" and feuding with The Beatles for the crown of Britain's top band.

Richards, known for his hard-living and cantankerous public comments, on Friday releases ""Crosseyed Heart,"" his first solo album in 23 years.

The album -- featuring Richards, rather than Stones frontman Mick Jagger, on vocals -- brings in a range of collaborators including the jazz and blues singer Norah Jones.",b5afa4d5-f789-4bf2-9edf-5dcb326cec9b,News,2015-09-16T19:24:45Z,Yahoo!

7315,"Ever since Apple unveiled the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus last week, fans and privacy advocates have expressed concerns over two features: Live Photos, and the always-on 'Hey Siri.' The Cupertino-based tech giant has assured users that their data is fully secure and encrypted. The company has long been vocal about its stance on user privacy and security. 
 

 iPhone 6S Live Photos won't spy on you  
Live Photos makes your images come alive by stitching together three seconds of motion and audio before and after you take the picture. In order to make your photos 'come alive,' the app starts capturing information as soon as you access the feature. Apple said these automatically captured images or the motion (1.5 seconds before and 1.5 seconds after taking the picture) are not permanently stored on your device or the iCloud or anywhere else. 
 
Though the camera starts ""recording"" the moment you turn on the Live Photo mode, the motion 1.5-second before is not saved until the user presses the camera button, reports TechCrunch . Apple treats Live Photos the same way it treats existing photos and videos. They leave your iPhone 6S or 6S Plus only after you purposely share them or upload them to iCloud. 
 The 'listening' audio is continuously overwritten  
Meanwhile, Hey Siri doesn't require your device to be plugged into a power source to be active. The always listening feature raised concerns about how that data would be handled, transmitted and sent. Since Hey Siri is an optional feature, users can choose never to enable it in iOS 9. Apple said the feature doesn't record or send what the user says in front of the device. The device starts recording only after ""the feature is triggered."" 
 
The Cupertino company said the ""listening"" audio is continuously overwritten. It will be used to enhance Siri digital assistant's response time when the user activates Siri. 
 
Separately, iOS app developer Hamza Sood revealed that both the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus feature 2GB RAM.

2715,"Death of at least 11 Bangladeshis in the Mina stampede has now been confirmed by the Mecca hajj mission of HAAB, which also expressed fears that seven more unidentified fatalities were also Bangladeshi nationals. 
 
Ibrahim Bahar, president of Hajj Agencies Association of Bangladesh (HAAB), confirmed the numbers to the Dhaka Tribune. 
 
Expressing concerns that the real number of Bangladeshi fatalities might be much higher, Bahar said that according to the HAAB’s list, around 90 Bangladeshi pilgrims are still missing while 25 Bangladeshis are now undergoing treatment at different hospitals in Saudi Arabia. 
 
The hospitals where Bangladeshis are currently admitted includes Al Noor Hospital, King Abdullah Hospital and Mina Hospital, the HAAB chief said, adding that the Saudi government was not letting anyone enter those hospitals to collect information about the injured. 
 
Asked whether there would be any compensation from the Saudi government to the families of the stampede victims, he said: “We do not have any such information yet.” 
 
Bahar added that all of the Bangladeshi victims would be buried in Saudi Arabia. 
 
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia’s English-language daily Arab News yesterday reported that preparations have been made in six cemeteries of Mecca to bury the stampede victims upon their families’ approval. 
 
The authorities concerned, however, were also ready to deliver the bodies and all relevant assistance to families wishing to bury their relatives in their homelands, Arab News further reported. 
 
Qulkhani for a Jamalpur haji 
 
A family in Jamalpur has held the qulkhani for one of their relatives, who they claim was killed in the Mina stampede. 
 
The family from Hatchandra village claims that Firoza Khanam, a retired schoolteacher and mother of five, had gone to this year’s hajj with her son Khandaker Mozaharul Islam. 
 
Mozaharul was with his mother when the stampede killed her, but Saudi police soon took away her body, said Firoza’s other son Khandaker Faridul Islam. 
 
Since then, Mozaharul had been searching different hospitals for his mother’s body, but to no avail, Faridul told our correspondent. 
 
Two reported deaths in Sylhet family 
 
A family in Sylhet claims that one of their relatives had died in Thursday’s Mina crush, while another is also feared dead. Three more of their relatives were also injured in the incident, they further said. 
 
The family from Sylhet city’s Syedanibagh said the body of one of their family members – Shaheda Begum – has been identified, but another relative – Asma Begum – has been missing since Thursday’s stampede. 
 
Syed Fazilat Hossain, brother-in-law of Shaheda, said five members of the family were together when the stampede took place. Asma’s husband Syed Shakhawat Hossain and Shaheda’s husband Sadeque Hossain lost consciousness during the crush and were rushed to local medical facilities. 
 
After regaining consciousness, they set out to find their wives and identified Shaheda’s body at a Saudi hospital on Saturday; even though Asma could not be found, the family believes she had died, Fazilat told our correspondent. 
 
Brahmanbaria haji identified by brother 
 
A family in Brahmanbaria’s Kasba upazila says one of their relatives, Jahedul Islam Bhuiyan Shwapan, had died in the Mina stampede. 
 
Jahedul’s elder brother Aminul Islam Bhuiyan said the news of the death was confirmed on Sunday by another brother who had been accompanying Jahedul in the pilgrimage. 
 
Quoting Khairul Islam Bhuiyan, the brother currently in Saudi Arabia, Aminul told our Brahmanbaria correspondent that Jahedul had been missing since the symbolic stoning of the devil. His body was later found at a morgue and identified using the identification card on the body. ",fa110025-b0fc-493b-bbc0-896d429e41cd,News,2015-09-28T18:43:54Z,Dhaka Tribune,HAAB: 11 confirmed Bangladeshi fatalities,0.0,News
1882,"Curtis James Meyer died at the scene of the incident, authorities said. 

The Mitchell Police Division responded to a disturbance call at a Mitchell residence located at the 500 block of North Mentzer Street, according to a press release from the South Dakota Attorney General’s Office. 

“During the call to service, the officer encountered a subject with a gun,” said a statement in the release. “The incident escalated, and during an ensuing struggle Mitchell Police Officer Russ Stevenson shot the armed subject with the subject’s gun.” 

The shooting, which occurred at approximately 1:52 a.m. Friday, involved one gun, said Mitchell Chief of Public Safety Lyndon Overweg. It was the subject’s gun, and the officer’s gun was not involved in the incident, he said. 

Overweg declined to provide additional details because the Division of Criminal Investigation, at the request of the Mitchell Police Division, is investigating the shooting. 

At the completion of the investigation, the South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation will issue a case report and shooting summation to be reviewed by the Attorney General for a final determination on the officer’s action. The release of the summary is anticipated within 30 days. 

No other information about the early-morning incident was immediately available. 

The last time a Mitchell Police officer fatally shot a person was Nov. 8 at the Quality Inn in Mitchell. Sgt. Dave Beintema, an officer with the Mitchell Police Division, was justified, according to a report from the South Dakota Attorney General’s Office, in his use of lethal force when he shot Joy Ann Sherman, a 52-year-old Mitchell resident, after she barricaded herself in her room at the Quality Inn, located at 1221 S. Burr St., and threatened to shoot herself and others.",c82e56f7-0aef-42f1-8f53-947ea7f28006,News,2015-09-04T18:58:52Z,Mitchell Daily Republic,Authorities: Mitchell man fatally shot with own gun by police officer,0.0,News

An alleged Al-Qaeda-linked Islamist militant accused of ordering the destruction of treasured monuments in Mali's fabled city of Timbuktu will appear before judges at the International Criminal Court on Wednesday. 

Ahmad al-Faqi al-Mahdi is due in the dock at 0900 GMT on his first appearance in The Hague-based court after being handed over by authorities in Mali's neighbour Niger on Saturday. 

The case is the first to be brought by the world's only permanent war crimes court over the extremist violence that rocked Mali in 2012 and 2013. 

Faqi, a Tuareg leader also known as Abu Tourab, is suspected of war crimes for the deliberate destruction of buildings at a UNESCO-listed desert heritage site in 2012. 

Nicknamed the ""City of 333 Saints"", Timbuktu, which is located around 1,000 kilometres (600 miles) northeast of Mali's capital Bamako, was overrun by Al Qaeda-affiliated jihadists in the spring of 2012. 

In June of that year, the militants destroyed more than a dozen of the city's mausoleums dating back to its golden age as an economic, intellectual and spiritual centre in the 15th and 16th Centuries. 

Faqi was a leader of Ansar Dine, a mainly Tuareg group, which held sway over Mali's desert north, together with Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and a third local group, until being routed in a French-led intervention in January 2013. 

On Wednesday, a judge will inform him of the charges against him and verify his identity and the language in which he is able to follow the proceedings. 

The judge could also set a date for a hearing to determine whether Faqi will face trial. 

Born in Agoune, 100 kilometres west of Timbuktu, Faqi is described by the ICC as having been ""an active personality in the context of the occupation of Timbuktu"" as the alleged leader of the ""Hesbah"" anti-vice squad. 

A member of an Islamic court set up by the jihadists to enforce strict sharia law, he is alleged to have jointly ordered or carried out the destruction of nine mausoleums and Timbuktu's famous Sidi Yahia mosque. 

The mausoleums were constructed to pay homage to deceased saints but were considered blasphemous by the jihadists. 

Around 4,000 ancient manuscripts were also lost, stolen or burned during the Islamists' reign of terror. 

In January 2013, ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda launched an investigation into alleged war crimes in Mali. 

Details of Faqi's arrest in Niger remain unclear.

5645,"The anticipated canonization of Spanish priest Junípero Serra has generated months of debate over whether his missionary work among Native Americans in 18th century California makes him worthy or not to be a saint. The discussion has also shed some insight into the process and thinking behind the Roman Catholic Church's identification and eventual canonization of individuals as saints . Pope Francis will perform the special mass — the first canonization on American soil — on Sept. 23 in Washington, D.C., where a statue of Serra stands in the U.S. Capitol building, The Washington Post reported this week. Since the Vatican announced the upcoming canonization in January, protests through letters and petitions have surfaced to prompt church leaders to reconsider the decision. A bill proposing to remove Serra's statue was filed in the California Legislature, but it was later tabled. Serra, an 18th-century Franciscan priest and philosopher from the island of Mallorca, Spain, has long been both praised and pilloried for his role in establishing nine missions along the California coast. According to historian Robert Senkewicz , the troubled legacy stems from Catholic missionaries being both emissaries of the gospel and agents of the state. ""A great deal of the tension in the mission system stemmed from this double purpose, for these two aims did not always coexist easily with each other,"" Senkewicz told the National Catholic Reporter . While the missions brought education, economic development and protection from Spanish military to the Native Americans, the paternalistic system also introduced disease, environmental degradation and unintended abuse to the indigenous tribes. ""The presence of the Spanish colonial enterprise very quickly rendered it almost impossible for the traditional native ways of life to be maintained,"" he said. ""So, some people came into the mission system because their traditional ways of life and sustenance was being destroyed by the colonial invaders."" Pope Francis, who hails from Argentina, is aware of the good and the bad the church's early Spanish missionaries brought to the New World. According to various news accounts of his July tour of South America, he apologized and asked forgiveness ""for crimes committed against the native peoples during the so-called conquest of America,"" but also asked people to “recognize the priests and bishops who strongly opposed the logic of the sword with the strength of the cross."" Page 2 of 2 - In an analysis for Religion News Service , writer David Gibson explained how Pope Francis' statements in South America present a more nuanced view of faith and sainthood that goes ""beyond the polarities of all good or wholly terrible."" ""Those either/or verdicts are a kind of fundamentalism, forcing a blinkered acceptance of everything as good or a puritanical rejection of the whole because it is polluted by one failing or another — shortcomings that are the very reason for the church’s existence, and the pilgrimage of holiness,"" he wrote. Senkewicz told NCR that it's not fair to hold Serra out as a symbol for everything bad that came out of the church mission system, which developed long after Serra died. “My sense is that people are not canonized because they are perfect — otherwise, presumably, St. Peter would never have been canonized,” he said, according to Crux . “They are canonized because they made a commitment which, on balance, had more good than non-good associated with it.” That's the rationale of Andrew Galvan, a descendant of Native Americans converted to Catholicism, a Catholic and museum director at Mission Dolores in San Francisco, in his longtime support for Serra's sainthood: ""He is a person of that time — it is not correct to judge him by our standards,"" Galvan told NPR . But Galvan's assistant director, who is also a descendant of missionary Indians and a practicing Catholic, says Serra doesn't deserve such honor, but he hopes the attention will spur a movement to restore Native American traditions and culture that were lost in the 18th century. ""If we can take something that I perceive as being negative, channel that frustration into some good, then ultimately we all win in the end, you know?"" says Vincent Medina. ""Andy gets his saints. I get Indians in the Mission.""",862d8b8b-dff4-483a-a4bb-74225eb76e61,News,2015-09-16T12:38:46Z,Murphysboro American,Upcoming canonization of Spanish priest in America sheds insight on sainthood,0.0,Blog
4225,"One thing you can say about Vatican leaders — they show great faith in heavenly happenings, but rarely fall for the earthly ones. In this case, the Vatican has set its investigative sights on one of the biggest scams in the apparition business, long known to play parlor tricks on the desperate and faithful throughout the world. A popular shrine known as Our Lady of Medjugorje in Bosnia and Herzegovina is being investigated regarding claims that the Virgin makes regular and even prompt appearances, and has been hovering around the site since 1981, when she appeared to six children to reportedly convey the message that no one can pronounce Medjugorje and the name should be changed. She was ignored, which is probably why she’s still skulking around. No, I jest. She supposedly conveyed a message of peace to the kids, who are now adults and clearly know a good gig when they invent it, as Medjugorje has become a major tourist destination, and the kids aren’t doing too badly, either. In 1988, the shrine even attracted one of Worcester, Massachusetts’ better-known “victim souls,” the late Audrey Santo or “Little Audrey,” who was brought there by her mother. The enterprise I dubbed Audrey Inc. was also investigated by the local diocese and still seeks donations on social media. More on that later. In any case, the Vatican is due soon to reveal the results of its investigation into this popular religious destination, but Pope Francis recently injected some papal humor that leads one to believe it’s not looking good for the believers. In July, he said Catholics shouldn’t be expecting “visionaries who can tell us exactly what message Our Lady will be sending at 4 o’clock this afternoon.” Ha, ha! OK, so maybe Francis is no laugh riot. He’s the pope, for goodness sake, not Louie C.K. But if I were an apparition, I certainly wouldn’t want the leader of the Roman Catholic Church cracking jokes at my expense, especially when my very existence was in doubt. And it’s not only the apparition in jeopardy. Medjugorje was a poor village before the Virgin popped in, but now it’s home to hotels, restaurants and lots of souvenir shops. The active Medjugorje website says people “owe it to yourself and your loved ones” to check out the myriad healings and miracles that occur there. The Vatican, meanwhile, said dioceses shouldn’t organize official pilgrimages, although it’s basically OK to swing by if you happen to be in the neighborhood. Speaking of neighborhoods, Worcester, Massachusetts, is also home to some spiritual shenanigans over on South Flagg Street, headquarters of the Little Audrey Santo Foundation. Audrey was pulled unconscious from the family swimming pool in 1987 at age 3, rendering her in a state known as akinetic mutism. So the family turned the home into a popular shrine complete with a gift shop filled with Audrey memorabilia, such as refrigerator magnets and mousepads. The tragic girl, meanwhile, was placed on public display, amid typical claims of weeping statues, flowing mystery oil, bleeding Communion wafers and the like. Page 2 of 2 - As noted, Audrey’s mother tried to take the girl to Medjugorje in 1988, but Audrey suffered cardiac arrest near the site and had to be rushed home by air ambulance at a cost of $25,000, a bill her grandmother mortgaged her home to pay. Rather than conclude that this poor child couldn’t handle the strain of travel, her mother attributed the heart failure to the presence of a nearby abortion clinic. Audrey died in 2007 at 23, and her supporters have since launched a campaign to canonize her. The Santo Foundation is still active; calls placed to the listed number urge people to “save the date” of Dec. 19, Audrey’s birthday, for a healing Mass. It also accepts donations. But the phenomenon of Little Audrey, also known as Little Fraudrey by skeptics, made diocese leadership uncomfortable. A probe was launched, and a commission report concluded, “One cannot presume that the inability to explain something automatically makes it miraculous.” In other words, the commission may well have asked, “Were we the only ones who saw the lab analysis by The Washington Post that showed the ‘mystery oil’ actually contained soybean oil and chicken fat? Does that sound miraculous to you people?” I’m guessing that the report into Medjugorje reaches the same general conclusion. Religious apparitions may be big business, but they don’t have a ghost of a chance at Vatican validation. Dianne Williamson is a columnist for The Worcester (Mass.)

6059,"Most of the time I feel old, almost as old as I am, and far from young or new. But, as I look around, I sense and observe a new kind of ""old"" persons. Most all of we aging people, who tend to repeat ourselves repeatedly, comment about how our perspective as to what constitutes ""old"" has changed over the years. We seem to say those comments repeatedly as we pass through those ages we grew up thinking of as old. 

It's showing age by saying so, but when I started out ""way back when,"" I thought of 40 as borderline, and 50 seemed certainly old. I gave up those thoughts and perspective at a very early age. 

At age 9 or 10, I did something wrong and earned my father's displeasure. When discovered, I tried to run away from the ""old man,"" only to be outrun by my then nearly 50, and irritated, father. The quick ""arrest"" and increased consequences of my sin quickly adjusted my concept of ""old."" 

As I gravitate toward doubling that age of 40, after duly passing through the intermediate steps, I note we are seeing a new ""old"" all around us. We used to think of old as 65, which was also the end of male life expectancy. For the last half century or so, we've gotten used to and indoctrinated with 65 as time of retirement. 

Now, we have people working longer, and people in their 60s and 70s out looking for new jobs;  many of necessity, or to occupy free time. 

Older people aren't out just vainly attempting to recapture their youth. Many, if not most, of the healthier among us are living quite productively active extended years. 

Thanks to a number of remarkable circumstances, many of us have been blessed with continued existence and opportunity. The miracles of modern medicine have kept many of us alive, who otherwise would not be here. 

Absence of war within our borders, ever since the decimating Civil War, is another substantial factor. Regulated safety in the workplace and regulated safety in our traffic building and travel law enforcement thereof have saved many and provided longer lives. 

So here we are. Some older folks may still prefer to sit in the rocking chair and play traditional old; but more are out and about their community and actively engaged. Others will shift back and forth. 

Much of the good work going on is still performed by older persons. Much of our governmental acts and decision-making are being done by older persons in all branches of our government: executive, judicial and legislative. 

We older folks constitute a huge volunteer force for the betterment of all ages. We are our brothers' and sisters' keepers after all. Our churches and community organizations seem almost dominated by the gray hair of our new old. 

We fill a void in organizational activity that just isn't being filled by our expected replacements, whether that be because of changing culture, others being too busy, too uninterested or other time constraints. 

Whether you call us relics or survivors, bane or boon, asset or liability, we ""new old"" exist  among you, and in ever increasing numbers. So as the younger might tell us - ""Get used to it.""",39fcf86f-647f-4ffa-8f9c-ab378d4b139c,News,2015-09-04T21:09:32Z,Pine And Lakes News,From the Left Hand Corner: The new old,0.0,Blog

 ---Monk_Brendan on 9/10/15      Helpful Blog Vote (1) Kathr as far as Lutheran Church it was name by him because He LEFT the RCC and started teaching his view of what a Church should be. Nicole///////
Nicole, YOU SAID the Lutheran church was named BY HIM.....IT WAS NOT. Also He did not leave, he was excommunicated......two entirely different matters. Do you think Martin Luther was the ONLY person who questioned the evil the RCC had become? Hardly Nicole. Luther wanted CHANGE within the RCC, and rightly so. The RCC became wealthy off the backs of peasants, and corruption within, even to today as we see Pope Francis is still cleaning CORRUPTION out of the RCC. Makes me wonder what would have been the outcome if Pope Francis was Pope at the time of Luther. ---kathr4453 on 9/20/15 Nicole, we also know the RCC in these past years have had a mass exodus because of the evil of pedophiles the Church was covering up and even protecting. EGO again has nothing to do with calling evil evil. It's called CONSCIENCE. It's called righteousness, it's called TRUTH. The history of the Borgas is also well known. Telling poor souls they can PAY for the deceased in pergetory is pure corruption. BUT the RCC needed money to buy back property lost in a poker game and came up with that. You hate that Luther EXPOSED all this corruption? And 99 in all. Because of the reformation the RCC was forced to clean their own house, but ONLY AFTER their corruption was exposed. You should be thanking Martin Luther. ---kathr453 on 9/20/15 1 Peter 1:18-19
18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers,
19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:
We see Nicole that SCRIPTURE Clearly shows one cannot buy another's soul out of a fictitious place. Listen carefully to YOUR so called first Pope. ---kathr445 on 9/20/15 Cluny said, ""I've tried several times. He things the Bible is the same as Jesus.""
I think Samuel statement is very appropriate in responding to Cluny's Statement, ""
Those who do not have good arguments or verses for their views. Often resort to juvenile remarks, snide comments and personal attacks."" excellent point Samuel... thanks man... ---john9346 on 9/20/15 Jerry said, ""Peter was DEAD when Luther lived. Did you expect him to practice necromancy?""
But Peters successor (Pope Leo X) was alive, and that is who Martin Luther should have gone to.
Pray for me,
the unworthy monk Brendan ---Monk_Brendan on 9/20/15 I have read where Paul rebuked Peter. Galatians 2:11
But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.
Where he meet with James, Peter (Cephas) and John. Gal 2:9
And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship, that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.
Where Peter was for Circumcised and Paul for gentiles. See Galatians 2:8. Which would make Paul the Pope not Peter.
He did spend some time with Peter and James. Who headed the council Peter had to report to James too. Galatians 1:18,19. Acts 10, 15:19 21:8
AGape ---Samuelbb7 on 9/20/15 Nicole: ""Samuel, Paul went to Peter when there was a conflict, Luther didn't.""
Peter was DEAD when Luther lived. Did you expect him to practice necromancy?
---jerry6593 on 9/20/15 Kathr, Luther was warned SEVERAL times and indeed was excommunicated, by his choice. He was a RCC Priest, DUMMY he was not.
You can't debate because you take things TOO PERSONALLY.
Why do you think I hate Luther? Did I say I did? NOPE.
Show me my lie. Copy and Paste and lets debate it.
You made a statement claiming The Lutheran Church wasn't name after Martin Luther to ME accusing me of being derogatory to him.
When I give you proof with common sense, you get mad.
Really?
Sorry if I hurt your feeling.
But, don't attack me and get mad if I DEFEND myself.
Rob, Cluny answered you well.
Samuel, Paul went to Peter when there was a conflict, Luther didn't.
Acts 15:1-29 V7 Peter got up.. ---Nicole_Lacey on 9/19/15 \\Nicole Lacey, please show from Scripture where the Apostle Paul told people to call the Pope the Holy Father, to bow and too Worship the Pope. \\
rob, please show me the hard evidence that people worship the Pope.
(If anyone does, it's despite the teaching of their church, not because of it.)
Show me from the Scriptures where you find the terms ""accept Christ,"" ""personal savior,"" ""rapture"", invitation hymns, altar calls, and revivals.
Glory to Jesus Christ! ---Cluny on 9/19/15 Nicole Lacey, please show from Scripture where the Apostle Paul told people to call the Pope the Holy Father, to bow and too Worship the Pope. Show where people are told to pray to the Virgin Mary, say Hail Mary, and pray the Rosary. ---Rob on 9/19/15 Wow Nicole, first you insist Luther named a Church after himself, and NOW ...what? Change the context and subject of the conversation? Just say, OK I was wrong. But no Nicloe you can't do that can you. You had to instead spew all sorts of hate and put YOUR twist on it insisting now his EGO really liked it, AND that he had the power to stop the RCC from naming those they called heretics after the heretic. This is why it's hard to debate with you Nicole, because when you are shown the truth, you can't just accept it at face value. YOU have to LIE and TWIST the truth to somehow insist YOU were right all along. But worse yet is your obvious HATRED of Luther. Were you there Nicole? Isn't the truth Luther was excommunicated? ---kathr4453 on 9/19/15 Luther through reading scripture had an awakening of CONSCIENCES, after reading Romans ( proving the Word of God is LIVING AND POWERFUL AND STRONGER THAN A TWO EDGE SWORD) again proving scripture that those who SEEK will find the truth. There is a difference between SEEKERS, and those who just follow and believe what they are told. Luther never insisted others follow him, but gave others the same opportunity of being able to read the Bible for themselves, where FAITH COMES BY HEARING THE WORD OF GOD. Not hearing the word of man. You can't LEGALIZE FAITH. If perchance you understood that Nicole, you would be a seeker and not a follower. ---kathr453 on 9/19/15 Nicole you proved your point that Luther and the Lutheran church.
But he followed the Teachings of Paul and left the traditions of men. He supported following the Bible and using it as the final rule of what is doctrine. Paul and Jesus fought against traditions that Jewish leaders had built up instead of following the law of GOD. Mark 7:7-11
Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.
For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men,...
And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.
For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother, and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:.... ---Samuelbb7 on 9/19/15 kathr, Common sense tears your statements to pieces. A RC Priest decides leave THE RCC, and changes the traditions Paul told us to hold to them.
The hardest part is tell people to believe in him so much they are banking on their enteral life.
They followed him even after being excommunicated.
Mather Luther HAD that much POWER over the people to leave what is known to an unknown on his belief system.
But you want me to believe He COULDN'T STOP THEM FROM NAMING THE NEW CHURCH AFTER HIM??????? REALLY?? THE egoistic was smiling ear to ear.
Because a MAN who can convince you to leave your core faith, CAN tell you to remove my name from the Church. Didn't happen because he like it named after him. ---Nicole_Lacey on 9/18/15 \\Certainly wouldn't want to enlighten him would you.\\
I've tried several times. He things the Bible is the same as Jesus.
Glory to Jesus Christ! ---Cluny on 9/18/15 Cluny you said, ""This is useless topic to discuss with someone who is totally fuzzy about who Jesus is."" ""However, when I was a Baptist (before I got saved) we never got into essentials vs. non-essentials.
I agree This is a useless topic to discuss with someone who thinks diversity means disunity (baptists, lutherans, and presbyterians) and who is unable to support the claims they make and when challenged resort to personal attacks??

Brendan and Cluny can you both show from the confessions referred to you how the essentials and non-essentials are not defined as you have stated?? ---john9346 on 9/17/15 Read These Insightful Articles About Debt Consolidation The name Lutheran originated as a derogatory term used against Luther by German Scholastic theologian Dr. Johann Maier von Eck during the Leipzig Debate in July 1519. Eck and other Catholics followed the traditional practice of naming a heresy after its leader, thus labeling all who identified with the theology of Martin Luther as Lutherans.
Martin Luther always disliked the term, preferring instead to describe the reform movement with the term Evangelical, meaning ""good news"", i.e. ""Gospel.
Eventually Lutherans themselves began to use the term Lutheran in the middle of the 16th century in order to distinguish themselves from other groups, such as the Philippists and Calvinists. ---kathr4453 on 9/18/15 The RCC used the derogatory name Lutherens, not Martin Luther.---kathr4453 on 9/16/15 Do you know how silly that sounds?

---Nicole_Lacey on 9/16/15
Nicole, is the RCC the SAME as it was before the reformation? Do people still go,to hell for eating meat on Friday? ARE indulgences still being SOLD? And where do you place Wycliffe in all of this? He protested Catholicism long before Luther. Actually Wycliffe was never RCC in the first place was he? What about Hess, again never RCC and long before Luther. The RCC HATED Wycliffe. They actually dug up his bones and desecrated his buriel place out of HATE. Can you see Paul or Peter doing such a thing? ---kathr4453 on 9/17/15 Send a Free Christian Tract Cluny you said, ""Wrong again, not only because Baptists, Lutherans, and Presbyterians would disagree with you (all three denominations consider the points I mentioned to be doctrinal), but because there is no general agreement about what is essential and what is non-essential.""
all baptists, lutherans, and presbyterians agree these are matters of tradition and do define essentials from nonessentials. Please see LBC 1689 (baptist), WCF (presbyterian), and the following:
""Lutherans believe that the Bible teaches that a person is saved by Gods grace alone through faith in Jesus Christ alone.""

Glory to Jesus Christ! ---Cluny on 9/17/15 Yes Kathyr it stated as a derogatory term by the RCC. They recognized that Luther was the founder of that denomination which they labeled as heretical because they taught salvation was by Grace alone through faith alone. ""In 1521 Edict of Worms: The edicts of the Diet condemned Luther and officially banned citizens of the Holy Roman Empire from defending or propagating his ideas, subjecting advocates of Lutheranism to forfeiture of all property,..."" Salvation in the RCC was based on works of saints and people with grace helping. Or pushing as it says in some catechisms. Some took this to mean once saved always saved. A point you and I disagree with. But Grace in the RCC and our understanding leads to obedience. ---Samuelbb7 on 9/17/15 Read These Insightful Articles About Refinancing Cluny you asked, ""But all three are one in doctrine, right?""
Yes, because all the things you mentioned are not paramount to salvation ""Nonessentials/traditions.""
The Scriptures do not teach, ""you must be baptized (certain way) to be saved, you must take the Lord's Supper to be saved, and you must have a bishop over your church to be saved.
What is the way of salvation Luke, 13:1-5, Mar 1:15, and Acts 3:19.
I would invite you to do as these Scriptures command you my friend... ---john9346 on 9/17/15 \\baptists, lutherans, and Presbyterians are 1 church different in traditions,yet, one in doctrine.\\
Baptists will baptize only by immersion those who have ""accepted Christ.""
Lutherans and Presbyterians baptize infants by pouring or aspersion.
Some Lutherans have bishops, but Presbyterians and Baptists reject episcopacy.
Lutherans believe that the bread and wine have some connection with the Body and Blood of Christ, but Baptists deny this teaching.
But all three are one in doctrine, right?
Glory to Jesus Christ! ---Cluny on 9/17/15 Brendan you said, ""I am also sure that if I posted beliefs of Lutherans or Presbyterians, there are some that would disagree about those things.""
And why won't you post those beliefs my friend??
Nicole you stated, ""That's why there are 60,000 and growing Protestant Churches.""
I would like for you to cite your source to support this claim?? ---john9346 on 9/17/15 Nicole, the RCC would always call those they called heretics by the person's name who they believed were heretics. The RCC used the derogatory name Lutherens, not Martin Luther. Please understand your history before making statements you have no understanding of. This was a common practice of the RCC. ---kathr4453 on 9/16/15 Read These Insightful Articles About Franchises John 9346 said, ""baptists, lutherans, and Presbyterians are 1 church different in traditions,yet, one in doctrine."" So let's take a look at the Baptists:
Salvation involves the redemption of the whole man, and is offered freely to all who accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour, who by His own blood obtained eternal redemption for the believer. In its broadest sense salvation includes regeneration, justification, sanctification, and glorification. I am sure that there are some Protestants who would disagree about this statement.
I am also sure that if I posted beliefs of Lutherans or Presbyterians, there are some that would disagree about those things
Pray for me,
the unworthy monk Brendan ---Monk_Brendan on 9/16/15 Nicole you continue to ask, ""Please name one Church, just one that was started by one of the five REFORMERS still as he started TODAY?"" there is only 1 church.
st cyprian answers your question listen closely. ""The Church is also one, though spread far and wide by its ever-increasing fruitfulness. There are many rays of the sun, but one light. There are many branches of a tree, but one strength from its mighty root. From one spring flow many streams, and though they are multiplied in rich abundance, yet they are still united in one source."" st cyprian (Unity on the church)
baptists, lutherans, and Presbyterians are 1 church different in traditions,yet, one in doctrine. ---john9346 on 9/16/15 Of course he did, and infant baptism was practice in the ORIGINAL Lutheran Church. Infant baptism has been around since the 1st century
Kathr as far as Lutheran Church it was name by him because He LEFT the RCC and started teaching his view of what a Church should be.
As many do RIGHT NOW. They start another Church because they disagreed with their Pastor's version of being Christian.
That's why there are 60,000 and growing Protestant Churches.
Luther stated the process of if you disagree with the belief start you own Church.
Others came to the same conclusion when they didn't like Luther's vision of a Church.
You wrote all that and still having NAME one Church being the same when the 5 Reformer rebelled. ---Nicole_Lacey on 9/16/15 While Luther believed the Pope was the Antichrist he did not reject all the doctrines of the RCC. Nor of the Christian church which preceded it.
The Lutheran church was based on the Bible and the understanding that Luther taught. It looks to him as it's founder and he is alsco called the leader of the Reformation and Protestantism. So while your point is true. I consider it nitpicking. Peter was called on the carpet before James in the Jerusalem council. So how could he have been the sole leader. A doctrine not from the Original church. Agape ---Samuelbb7 on 9/16/15 Read These Insightful Articles About Lead Generation Nicole, Luther DID NOT , say, "" Let's start a new church and name it after me"". If you can PROVE this is what happened, please provide absolute proof ..date, etc. Yes of course This denomination was named after him. But there is a difference in something named after you, and you naming it after yourself. Did he still believe in infant baptism? Well that is RCC. ---kathr4453 on 9/15/15 Nicole you said, ""St Polycarp LIVED in the 2nd Century and one of the Fathers of the Church.

But I google Smyrnaeans chapter 8.
Guess what it is?
The Epistle of St. Ignatius of Antioch to the Smyrnaeans.
St. Ignatius lived in the 1st century.
I going to break it down for you all to answer me.
Name a Church reformed after the 16th Century by a Reformer who STARTED the Church DURING HIS LIFE TIME.
Lutheran is an example. Luther was one of the 5.
His Church is called Lutheran because he started it.
BUT, the Lutheran Church has broken into several branches not under one Bishop.
Now by following those rules, please name one. ---Nicole_Lacey on 9/15/15 It took awhile and scholars to work out an official canon. But it was done and finished by the 5th Century. The RCC actually fired Martin Luther because of his stand against the Rank hypocrisy and corruption going on. They labeled him a Heretic and he labeled the Pope the Antichrist. He also married a ex nun. Paul was approved by three people. Cephas means stone and is a nick name for Peter.
Galtions 2:9
And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship, that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.

Why talk about Polycarp if we are talking about the Reformers 13 centuries later???? I believe you are confused on the topic.
Luther never founded a church,and never left the RCC.--kathr4453
Really?
Luther was a Catholic Priest.
The Lutheran Church was stared at the same time Luther was alive. His name, his church. Common Sense.
Since the Lutheran Church isn't the RCC, then Luther HAD TO HAVE LEFT the RCC to have a Church named after his name.
History can't be changed because you disagree with it.
Jesus is God, not Paul. Jesus gave Peter the keys to the KINGDOM, NOT Paul.
Follow Jesus since His Blood saved you and I, not Paul's blood ---Nicole_Lacey on 9/15/15 Samuel, it's whether these men founded these denominations or whether denominations were founded because of these men . Luther never founded a church, and never left the RCC. But yes, your right, because of that we have churches built upon MAN. I'm of Calvin, I'm of Luther, I'm of Wesley, I'm of Apollo, I'm of Polycarp. And to have Polycarp interpretation of scripture held up as THE AUTHORITY of scripture, is insulting. Even in Paul's day it was common, he describes as carnality. But the RCC's answer is even worse. Paul never insisted on one man, or any man, the Pope, heading the church either. Christ is the HEAD, and all wisdom and knowledge come directly from Him to His Body....us. No middleman necessary. ---kathr4453 on 9/15/15 Kathyr. Some churches founded by the Reformers still in existence. Lutheran churches. Luther
Presbyterian. Calvin
Jesus answered the Scribes with the Scripture and showed them they were only quoting parts and not following the full Scripture. Matthew 23:23
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. ---Samuelbb7 on 9/14/15 Read These Insightful Articles About Personal Loans St Polycarp LIVED in the 2nd Century and one of the Fathers of the Church.

The Canon of Scripture was decided before the Christian church split in two. Nicole
The Reformers partially succeeded. Their actions brought about the counter reformation in which the worst of abuses of the RCC were curbed. You need to read some true history. There are Historians who give the facts. Nor rewrite the History of the Church to whitewash the events. I have books by Martin Luther and have read much by Wesley and Calvin even though they are not part of my church. There are Great Catholic writers which I have enjoyed. So why are you afraid to read what others have wrote?

As we see even today, many quote this one and that one calling them saints as though that was a sign to believe them.....bla bla bla. The only thing we need to be quoting is scripture...the WORD OF GOD. Some run to Polycarp or Calvin or Augustine for answers. Why not just go to scripture written by those GOD CALLED..... The Apostles and Prophets. The answer is...without the indwelling Holy Spirit, you can't understand the Scriptures....soooooo you need mere men like Polycarp to explain to you. ---kathr4454 on 9/14/15 Nicole you said, ""Sorry, but too many writings of TRUE Saints of the Church to waste time on writings from failed Reformers.""

Stop trying to change history. Jesus or God (the same) GAVE US THE CHURCH.
Give Scripture in the NT where Jesus gave us the Bible?
Chapter and Verse,
My Chapter and Verse where Jesus gave us the Church not the Bible is Matthew 16:18-19
And you are Peter, and upon this rock I WILL BUILD MY CHURCH, and the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it.
The Church is complete, but even the Bible can't hold all of Jesus as written in John 21:24-25
There are also many other things that Jesus DID, BUT IF these were to be described individually, I do not think the whole world would contain the BOOKS THAT WOULD BE WRITTEN. ---Nicole_Lacey on 9/13/15 The apostles taught the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. They were eye witnesses of His resurrection. Romans 10:9-10 is not the OT. However the OT testifies of Jesus, and His coming ...Jesus earthly ministry proves by the Law and Prophets Jesus is the Son of God. SOOO the Apostles did not JUST teach out of the OT. The MYSTERY wasn't even revealed until AFTER Jesus rose from the dead. ---kathr4453 on 9/13/15 GOD gave us the Bible all of it. He took none of it from us. 2Timothy 3:14-17
But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them,
And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in ighteousness:
That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.
The Apostles taught out of the Bible they had. The Old Testament. Agape ---Samuelbb7 on 9/13/15 Calvin believed in infant baptism, certainly not from the original, but is RCC. Calvin murdered annabaptists who in fact believed in believers baptism, which is what the Bible teaches. Wycliffe was long before Calvin or Luther, as was Hess. There has always been from the beginning a remnant of TRUTH who never joined the RCC in the first place. They weren't called Protestants either. Protestant meaning is to protest Catholicism. True believers in the Cross, proclaimed the Gospel....... ---kathr4453 on 9/13/15 Read These Insightful Articles About Health Insurance Samuel BB said, ""...Both place traditions above scripture in their understanding of doctrine.""
First, let us define a word. Tradition does not mean the number of beads on a rosary, or the vestments a priest wears, etc. Tradition does mean the things that have come down through the ages, like the writings of St. Ignatius of Antioch, and the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom
Also, Tradition means fasting, prayer, almsgiving, feeding the hungry, giving water to the thirsty, clothing the naked, and visiting the sick and those in jail.
All these things are the traditions that we place on the same level as Scripture, not above.
Pray for me,
the unworthy monk Brendan ---Monk_Brendan on 9/13/15 He took the OT with him?.---micha9344
Friend, Jewish people don't like you to call the Torah the OT.

Just in case you didn't know.
What are friends for if not to give a little information.

You are almost there, but you got lost in you own thinking.
The word 'reform' means to re do the original.
So, if the original isn't in the new it is hasn't been reformed.
If you have an old house that needs re-fixing, but the owner of the house refuses to allow you to touch it, so instead you build a new house copying the old house to the last nail.
Have you remodeled the old house, or just built a new house?
Can you claim you remodeled the old house?
No! As to the RCC, She has reformed Herself as Jesus instructed Her. Name one Church started by the famous 5 Reformers that is one, strong and GROWING today? ---Nicole_Lacey on 9/11/15 Brendan you asked, ""Is REFORMED Theology Reformed Catholicism?""
1. The reformation means to go back to that which was (from the beginning)
2. Catholicism means universal (referring to church)
3. The reformers wanted to reform the rcc, but realize it was impossible which led to ways to return to the beginning.
4. Reform Theology is built on the 5 Solas (Scripture Alone, Grace Alone, Christ Alone, Faith Alone, and for the glory of God Alone.)

6706,"Barack Obama. Photo: White House. 
 
JNS.org –  The High Holidays are here, reaching their crescendo with Yom Kippur’s Kol Nidre prayer, made famous by Al Jolson and Neil Diamond in “The Jazz Singer” movies. The literal meaning of Kol Nidre is “all vows.” More broadly, the prayer deals with the importance of words in shaping our lives, setting the tone for who we are — what we represent. 
 
Its message stands opposite the old adage we said as kids: “Sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will never harm me.” 
 
Not true. Words can hurt; words can harm. While a word is a word and a deed is a deed, words lead to deeds. 
 
A Jewish teaching declares that words have the intensity of fire. They are black fire on white fire, namely, black letters written on the white open space between them. More deeply, this teaches that words have power not only in their explicit meaning — the ink of the black letters — but in the less explicit, but equally important messages they imply. Those are the white spaces. 
 
As 20th-century Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein said, “Language disguises the thought.” But the discerning listener of language can read the white fire, revealing its meaning. 
 
This is an important message as the debate surrounding the Iran nuclear deal gains intensity. By now, the pros and cons of the deal have been presented. Positions have by and large been taken. I, for one, am strongly opposed. 
 
But a matter that is equally as important as the position one takes is the nature of the language used in the conversation. Which words are said? What is their message and what thoughts do they disguise? 
 
Here, both sides have made mistakes. Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, a Republican candidate for president, went too far when suggesting that the deal would take Israel to the ovens, an explicit allusion to the Holocaust — when six million Jews were murdered, often gassed and then incinerated. The Holocaust is trivialized when such language is used. Today, unlike then, we have the state of Israel, which can defend itself. 
 
What’s even more disturbing is the language used by President Barack Obama. Candidates seek partisan voters. The president speaks for all of America. As Obama has said, we are not the red states, or the blue states, but the United States. 
 
The president violated this commitment when he spoke last month at American University. There, he used language that implicitly isolated American Jews by questioning their loyalty. He did so when he said that the nuclear deal’s opponents are “backed by tens of millions of dollars in advertising.” The white fire of these words is understood by many Americans as referring to Jewish dollars. 
 
And when Obama presents the decision of Congress as a choice between approving the Iran deal and war — while singling out Israel as the agreement’s key opponent — he is interpreted by many as saying that Israel could be sending Americans to war. 
 
Of course, this is absurd. Americans have died defending Iraq and Lebanon, but never Israel. Still, the president’s language implies that turning down the deal could result in Americans defending and dying for Israel. 
 
At rallies this summer, I’ve heard too many hurl invectives at us like “traitor,” “go back to Israel where you belong,” and “you’re sending American soldiers to die for Israel.” 
 
License for the use of this type of dangerous language comes from the top. It emerges in part from the unwritten words that the president has uttered. 
    Good people can have honest disagreements. Kol Nidre reminds us that how we express these positions also matters. The words we choose — both those written in black and hidden in white — make a difference.    
As the Jewish adage goes, “Wise people, be careful with your words.”

7125,"Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore (Psalms 16:11). 

A father in Watford, England, was greatly troubled about his son who had gone wrong. The boy was far away, ill, and despondent. He wrote his father fearfully asking whether there was any hope of a reconciliation. The father sent him a telegram of just one word, ‘Home,’ and it was signed ‘Father.’ The gospel of Jesus Christ is God’s telegram to a sinful world. It is summed up in one word, ‘Home,’ and is signed by one word, ‘Father’even our Father in heaven. 

God alone knows the path of life. Men have traced many paths, and millions have plodded their sad miles for thousands of years, finding at the end that all their ‘yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death.’ He who is the living God, and He alone, knows and shows the path of life. ‘In him was life; and the life was the light of men’ (John 1:4). ‘As the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself’ (John 5:26). The path of life is revealed in the words of Christ, ‘The words that I speak unto you, . . . they are life’ (John 6:63). 

Are you acquainted with ‘fulness of joy’? God’s path of life leads to joy here and now’joy in His service, joy even in suffering and disappointment. ‘Count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations [or trials]’ (James 1:2; see 1 Peter 1:6-8). ‘For the kingdom of God is . . . joy in the Holy Ghost’ (Romans 14:17). This joy of believers cannot be explained; it is a ‘joy unspeakable and full of glory’ (1 Peter 1:8). And the path of life leads on to the very right hand of God above, where we enter into the joy of the Lord (Matthew 25:21) and find in His presence ‘pleasures for evermore.’ 

In His word, God has clearly shown us the path of life. Let us follow it today, for ‘the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day’ (Proverbs 4:18). 

MEDITATION PRAYER: ‘My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation’ (Psalms 13:5).

8272,"Highly-Valued Nesaranews Reporter [Freewill] Kidnapped and Held for the Purpose of Collecting Funds via Ransom, Extortion, and Fraud   Nesaranews values all of its contributors, reporters and readers. I wish to thank each and every one of you for your time, efforts and invaluable information. It has come to my attention that one of Nesaranews' most- valued contributors is in dire distress, as a result of crimes being inflicted upon him. You know this individual as ""Freewill"". Any aid you are in a position to provide is greatly appreciated.   A flesh and blood man, identified here as D. J., has been living on the land of Michigan as a free man for the past several years. The man has rejected servitude status, also known as Citizenship, under the corporate UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, as well as servitude status under the corporate STATE OF MICHIGAN, vis-a-vis notifying theses parties of the cancellation of any and all contracts with them, their franchises and agents. D. J. has filed a signed and sealed Act of State, in which he declared his intentions and desire to severe all ties to these corporate entities, into the records of STATE OF MICHIGAN, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, and the international court in The Hague. D. J. also copyrighted the name of the corporate entity which phonetically mimics his Christian and sur- names, and removed this corporate entity to foreign soil to place it outside of the legal reach and jurisdiction of the corporations UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, STATE OF MICHIGAN, their franchises, subsidiaries and agents. In doing so, D. J. stood up for himself, and indirectly for all of us, to declare to the corporations which are merely acting as government, and acting rather illegally and unlawfully at that, the supreme law of the land still stands and he [D. J.] stands upon it, juxtaposed to these corporations, their franchises and subsidiaries, and their agents. The corporation STATE OF MICHIGAN, its franchises and subsidiaries, as well as its agents, and unwitting third-parties which have been drawn into contract to attend to unlawfull and illegal activities, have engaged in criminal activites, including kidnapping, kidnapping with intent to hold for ransom, extortion, and fraud, thereby inflicting direct damages upon D. J., as well as indirect damages upon those who attempt to render aid to D. J. Falsified and fraudulent complaints have been filed against D. J. The intent, on the part of a number of subsidiaries and agents of and for the corporation STATE OF MICHIGAN, to force D. J. to re-enter into contracts with them, as well as intent to impose penalties under past terms of past [fraudulent] contracts, is obvious. These corporate parties want to force a free man back into servitude to them and want to exact revenge upon him for calling them out on their lack of legal standing (Refer to the bankruptcy of 1933, applicable to all corporations acting as governmental bodies, from UNITED STATES OF AMERICA and STATE OF MICHIGAN, to all departments, agencies, agents, municipalities, including courts and law enforcement entities; All of these corporations have remained bankrupt, see H.J.Res. 192 (June 5th, 1933), hence the perpetual issuance, trade in, and collection of notes of debt, a fiat form of currency, in financial transactions); if successfull, these corporations, their employees and agents will acquire ill-gotten gains through the victimization of D. J., a man who has worked hard through Nesaranews and through his daily interactions everyone he encounters to enlighten all of us as to the criminal and evil activities which have been and continue to go on around each and every one of us.

3485,"A Joe Paterno-themed beer has sold nearly one million cans in its first week, reports FOX Sports. 
 
Duquesne Brewing Company, a Western Pennsylvania brewery, has sold over 3,000 barrels of its Paterno beer, which features the former Penn State coach and his some of his old records on the label. 
 
“In the beginning, there was some reluctance,” said Mark Dudash, owner of the company. “[But] one distributor would order one palette, then the next day four palettes and then next day a half of a truckload. ...We had hoped by the fifth Penn State game to have sold 500 barrels worth. We're up to 3,000 barrels already.” 
 
Paterno, of course, was fired from Penn State in November 2011 in the wake of the Jerry Sandusky scandal, and passed away from complications relating to his lung cancer treatment in January 2012. 
 
Despite the polarizing reaction to Paterno across the country, it would appear his fan base in Pennsylvania and parts of New Jersey is still quite loyal. 
 
The Paterno beer is only being sold in those two states so far, but it's still flying off the shelves.

Peter Jackson’s critically acclaimed Lord of the Rings (LOTR) trilogy is adapted from J.R.R. Tolkein’s incredible books. These films take you on an epic journey through the detailed and beautiful cinematic universe of Middle Earth and the arduous battle between good and evil., The films are widely regarded as one of the most critically and financially successful franchises of all time, spawning a highly divisive prequel trilogy (The Hobbit) that could never live up to the success of the original.

Wait…this is an exact description of Star Wars…You sure?...alright fine. Anyway!

So without further a do, here is a trailer for the LOTR trilogy:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnf4h5HT4dc

FUN FACT: The word Frodo is said 116 times in the trilogy. This is a rate of 0.208 Frodo’s per minute.

BEFORE I START THIS, TRILOGY IS A DEFINITE MUST SEE!

The LOTR franchise is split into The Fellowship Of The Ring, The Towers and Return Of The King. I will not go into too much plot detail, as this is a review, not a PhD thesis.

Frodo (Elijah Wood), a young, inquisitive hobbit, comes into possession of a mysterious ring following the disappearance of his uncle, Bilbo (Tom Holms). Gandalf (Ian McKellan), an aging, powerful wizard discovers this is ‘’The One Ring’’ of power that belonged to the Dark Lord Sauron. Thus begins a chain reaction which sees Frodo on a quest to destroy the one true ring and save middle Earth…COME ON…THIS IS JUST STAR WARS SET IN THE MIDDLE AGES…THERE IS DEFINITELY SOME COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT GOING ON HERE…FINE...I’LL DROP IT

[SIGH]

Frodo, accompanied by Sam, his closest friend and gardener, sets off to meet Gandalf in the village of Bree so that he can get the ring somewhere safe. En route they bump into Merry and Pippin, while they’re stealing crops, who join them on their journey. Incidentally, Merry and Pip are the least qualified saviours in the history of everything…during the course of the trilogy they make blunders of such utter stupidity that I wonder how they made it this far in life. When they reach Bree Gandalf is not there and instead they find Stryder, a mysterious ranger, who helps them evade Sauron’s Black riders. Something they only had to do because Pip blew Frodo’s cover.

The group reach the Elven stronghold of Rivendell where they are reunited with Gandalf. Here a Fellowship is formed to aide Frodo in his quest. The Hobbits, Gandalf, Stryder (now called Aragorn), a bitter man called Boromir. And finally Legolas and Gimli, an elf and dwarf who are constantly bickering.

Plot wise that is about all you need to know. What follows in a 558-minute epic that takes you through highs, lows, battles, betrayal, love, immortality, obsession, mental illness and emotional connection. (By the way there is a 683 minute extended cut, which is also worth a watch).

The first instalment, The Fellowship, serves as an introduction to Middle Earth, its inhabitants, its history, the horrors of the previous war and the malevolence that once again threatens Middle Earth. At its core is the journey of our Hobbits and the bonds of the fellowship. The violence and hardships are personal, the losses are intimate and the battle is for the life of you and your friends. The film never drags and is a great first entry and, although not small by any stretch of the imagination, it is on a smaller scale than its sequels.




The second film, Two Towers, shifts away from Frodo and Sam and more towards the realms of men and Saruman’s fall from grace, the white wizard who Gandalf initially considered a friend. This film is really about redemption; the bonds of the fellowship following their breakdown, the waning strength of men and of those lost to evil. There are a myriad of new characters, however, the standout is Gollum, played by Andy Serkis using motion capture CGI. Gollum was once a hobbit who was corrupted by the ring and is obsessed with it. His ‘’precious’’ fills his every waking thought since he lost it to Bilbo Baggins (see prequel trilogy for clarification). He exhibits serious symptoms of a nearly dozen mental illnesses and disorders that I would not wish on my worst enemy. But grudgingly he develops a fragile relationship with Frodo and agrees to help him find his way into Mordor. Serkis is exceptional in every scene, he is nuanced, he is over the top and he is captivating. It truly is a remarkable performance!

Everything is bigger this time around. The battles, the castles, the enemies, the stakes. Sauron grows more powerful each day, and as such the second film should feel more charged and deadly. It all serves to increase the tension and completely draw you in.

The final instalment, Return Of The King, is the big finish. Everything is stepped up to another level. This time we are not fighting for our home or friends. This could be the end of everything and you can feel it through every second of the final confrontation with Sauron’s army.




You cannot discuss LOTR without discussing the visuals, it is basically a giant tourism piece for New Zealand, where it was filmed. The beautiful landscapes are combined with CGI and set pieces and in doing so become the most important character in the trilogy. The Shire is green and tranquil and captures the innocent, simple life of Hobbits. The grandiose pomposity of the Elves is captured by Rivendell. The realms of men are impressive and foreboding but have been neglected and miss repaired, much like the fading strength of men maligned at the beginning of the series. Then there is Mordor, explored deeply in the final film, a putrid landscape so foul and toxic that it could only breed pure evil. These backdrops are all encompassing, detailed and beautiful and draw you in. You become part of Middle Earth, this is a fight for your home and your people! Without this the series would have not been the success it is!

Furthermore, they provide the huge scale that makes the series so impressive. Even the first film, with its much smaller set pieces and action, takes you on a journey across half a world: the Shire, Bree, Weathertop, Rivendell, mines of Moria, Woods of Lothlorien, the woods of Parth Galen (the final action sequence is here)… This is a complete world of such magnitude and detail that it paved the way for modern cinematic franchises. Before this film no one even attempted something of this scale. The Marvel cinematic universe wouldn’t have been possible without LOTR blazing a trail.

But a series of pretty pictures do not a film make. The film needs heart, you need to care about the characters and believe their relationships. And you are not let down. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin, Frodo and Sam, provide the emotional core of the film as they go through hell and back. Their relationship is heart-warming and it is difficult to watch their burdens way heavy on it. Interestingly they haven’t delivered performances anywhere near this level since. Ian McKellan’s Gandalf is fantastic, his stage background was perfect to produce the gravitas and presence needed. He received the trilogy’s only acting Oscar nomination. Viggo Mortensen delivers a strong turn as Aragorn. And I’ve already mentioned Gollum.

However it is not all sunshine and rainbows; the rest of the cast do a great job but for the most part they are replaceable and not memorable of their own accord. The screenwriting and dialogue is generally great, but there are some scenes that come across as quite cliché. There also seems to be an undercurrent of sexual tension between Sam and Frodo, although I could be reading too much into this. There are lots of longing glances, intimate dialogue and a slow-mo scene towards the end where Frodo’s laughing turns into a deep, sensual stare as Sam enters the room.

Alas, with praise also comes criticism:

	The female characters are strong, powerful and interesting but underused. Most of the time the women serve to propel their male counterparts forward in the plot. And they do not once interact with each other, although with this being a book adaptation maybe this wasn’t possible within the confines of the story. The exception maybe Eowyn but even she falls for Aragorn who cannot return her love.
	The entire cast is white. I know this is a fictional place so we don’t have anything to base racial proportions on but that’s sort of my point. Would it have really mattered if some of the characters were played by non-white actors? No. This is less of a problem with the film itself than the industry as a whole but it is still worth mentioning.

The relationship between Legolas and Gimli is interesting as they overcome, generations of tension and animosity between their races to become close friends. This obviously has some current relevancy as we have a long way to go with racial equality. But again they are both white…so see above.

	Even Nazgul, Sauron’s minions, whose only drive is their primal need to find the ring still fall victim to, ‘’Bad Guy Monologue-ing’’. We’ve all seen it. The good guy is done for all the bad guy has to do now is just get on with it. Instead he wastes just enough time explaining his plans that the good guy can escape. And while the Nazgul do not monologue they do waste time and get distracted. Or, more frustratingly, just aren’t very good at finding things. This happens at least 7 times during the trilogy.
	Multiple endings! This has been the films biggest criticism. The final film takes about 40 minutes to end including: eagles, two weddings, book writing, narration, a whitewash reunion and a boat trip. There are at least five different places where the film could have feasibly ended without causing any problems.

There is no denying Tolkein’s genius but here are some of my issues!

	THE FUCKING EAGLES. Whenever Tolkein ran out of ideas on how to solve a problem he just called in the eagles. Gandalf’s trapped. Eagles. Outnumbered in battle. Eagles. Frodo’s trapped. Eagles. The entire prequel Hobbit trilogy. Eagles. Why not just give them the bloody ring and let them fly to Mordor? It’d certainly be much quicker.



	This one is more of a niggle. Dwarfes and Elves hate each other. SO why, in the name of all that is holy, is the password to get into Moria an Elvish word?
	This series is black and white. Good vs Evil. The characters are either one or the other. I suppose it makes sense in this story but it does leave some of the characters a bit flat. I suppose everyone has the same enemy so maybe they put all other duplicitous plans on the back burner for now? I mean if you exclude Sauron the biggest dicks in the series are men. But even then that’s only because there are two evil men and the rest are good. The only character with any level of grey is Boromir, but his grey is negated by the fact that his actions are part of a misguided plan to do the right thing for his people by fighting the enemy with his own weapon.

All that being said, this series is not just an exceptional cinematic achievement but is an all-encompassing, engrossing and enjoyable watch. Do yourself a favour, set aside 9 hours and watch it!

VERDICT: 



PS/ If you want to make a good movie, cast Sean Bean and then kill him. It just works…Patriot Games, Golden Eye, The Field, Game Of Thrones. It’s not worth the risk of letting him live, just ask Jupiter Ascending or The Silent Hill franchise! Although he does still die in some bad movies…trust Michael Bay to ruin a good thing!

PPS/ As a reward for reading all that here are some fun facts.

2609,"KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 14 (Bernama) -- Hong Leong Investment Bank has  maintained its ""buy"" call with a target price of RM1.98 on AirAsia Bhd following its unit Asia Aviation Capital Ltd's (AACL) announcement it has entered into an aircraft lease transaction with Indonesia AirAsia X (IAAX). 
IAAX will lease five Airbus A320-200s aircraft for a period of 12 months and pay US$350,000 per month to AACL. 

IAAX will be paying a similar rate as the previous lessee, Indonesia AirAsia (IAA), and in total AACL will receive US$21 million from this leasing exercise. 

Prior to the agreement, these aircraft were being leased by IAA, which is currently experiencing excess capacity (IAA faces difficulties in domestic flights due to government regulation of the ceiling price and Batik Air's aggressive capacity addition) and will subsequently return these aircraft to AACL. 

""We expect these aircraft will be slotted into the Australian route to entrench IAAX's position and deter any potential competitor in this route,"" said the research house. 

Currently, IAAX flies from Denpasar to Melbourne, Taipei and Jakarta, it said. 

As at noon, AirAsia Bhd eased three sen to RM1.22, with 11,0000 shares changing hands.

5803,"The latest developments in Pope Francis' visit to Cuba and the United States. All times local:

10:30 a.m.

Holguin's Plaza of the Revolution is packed with thousands of people waving flags as Francis travels in his popemobile through the crowd.

It's heating up quickly at 84 degrees Fahrenheit and high humidity, and lots of people are dressed in white to protect themselves from the sun. Cuban President Raul Castro is one of many wearing wide-brimmed straw hats.

Security agents don't appear to be letting members of the crowd get close to Francis. On Sunday in Havana, an apparent dissident clung to the popemobile and appeared to be appealing to the pontiff before the man was dragged away.

Ismabel Rodriguez is a 20-year-old engineering student who says the pope is urging islanders to embrace values like charity, community and family.

Rodriguez says ""Cubans are very nice people, but we've lost a lot of our values. There's lying, robbery and there's isn't enough priority given to the family.""

---

9:35 a.m.

Singing children and a small crowd waving Cuban and Vatican flags are greeting Francis upon his arrival at the airport in the eastern city of Holguin.

Some cried out ""Francis! Holguin is with you!"" from the tarmac as the pope emerged from an Alitalia plane.

Cuban First Vice President Miguel Diaz-Canel is heading the government delegation to receive the pontiff.

From the airport Francis travels to the city's Revolution Plaza for a morning Mass in front of thousands of people with hats and parasols shielding themselves from the sun.

A giant image of the Virgin of Charity of Cobre, Cuba's patron, is mounted on a building in the square.

---

9:15

Pope Francis has landed in the eastern city of Holguin, the second stop on a tour of the island ahead of a visit to the United States.

The pope is scheduled to celebrate Mass in the city's Revolution and visit La Loma de la Cruz, a cross and lookout point above Cuba's third-largest city. Then he'll head to Santiago for a visit to the shrine of Cuba's patron saint in the nearly town of Cobre.

---

8:05 a.m.

A plane carrying Pope Francis has left Havana for the eastern city of Holguin, the third-largest on the island, where thousands of people have already gathered in the city's plaza for today's papal Mass.

Fifty-eight-year-old Idael Confesor Martinez Leyva wore a straw hat topped with Cuban and Vatican flags as she entered the plaza. She said the pope ""is going to transform the world and bring us what we need most, especially the young people.""

2037,"Gorgeous Here leave a comment » It is absolutely gorgeous here right now. Among the reasons we chose September for our wedding, the biggest one for me is, it is my favorite time of year. The humid heat of summer is breaking, and the air is crisp, with cool nights and warm days. When the sky is clear, the blueness is exquisite and it’s no longer so necessary to avoid the toasty sunshine. In fact, it practically begs a person to pause and soak it all in. The challenge is, there is barely a moment for pause. The daylight grows short and preparation for winter weather requires new projects be added to the list of others already underway or planned. This year, I am feeling as though the growing grass didn’t get the memo about the arrival of September. It is hard to get ready for winter when summer won’t back off and make room for fall. I spent most of the afternoon mowing lawn yesterday, after filling that dang right front tire on the tractor with a green slime leak sealant. Today I face the need to work the power trimmer to knock down the robust growth along edges and fence lines. It’s a chore that resonates of mid-summer responsibilities, with one improvement: That crisp and gorgeous September air doesn’t cause it to be such a sweaty, sticky job. . . . . . . . . . . .

433,"When the IPC originally formed their Code of Practice was quite progressive. The Prankster compared them favourably to to BPA in this blog. No doubt this conrtibuted to the DVLA awarding them provisional ATA status.
Since then the BPA have made large steps to become fairer to the motorist. The IPC on the other hand, did a Jekyll and Hyde as soon as they were awarded full ATA status by the DVLA. Since then their appeals service has become a joke, serving up institutionally biased results with poor understanding of parking-related and consumer law. Operators are allowed to submit false evidence and the IPC turn a blind eye.
Code of Practice
The IPC's true colours have emerged with the release of the latest version of their code of practice. It is worth comparing point by point with the previous version to show what happens when a rogue ATA is allowed to change its code without input or control from government.
Initial Audit
4.1 Initial compliance upon application for IPC membership is assessed by way of an Initial Audit
which, will be followed by a period of ‘probationary membership’ for 6 months this is
detailed further in Schedule 4.
4.1 Upon application for IPC Membership, compliance will be assessed by way of an Initial
Audit during a period of ‘probationary membership’ for the first 6 months. This is
detailed further in Schedule 4.
The audit no longer takes place before the member joins, but up to six months afterwards. This means the member has up to six months to operate without audited signage contracts and correspondence templates. At least two court cases taken out by IPC members have failed because the operator could not show a valid contract with the landowner was in place.
Investigation of Complaints
4.4 The IPC will investigate and record any complaints against members in order to ensure
compliance.
4.4 The IPC may investigate and record any complaints against members in order to ensure
compliance.
Complaints are not now always investigated. The Prankster has informed the IPC of several of their operators who breach the code of conduct. The IPC has refused to investigate. This can be contrasted with the behaviour our the BPA. When The Prankster informed them that UK PC were forging timestamps the BPA were reluctant to believe their members could do such a thing, but still investigated anyway. The IPC, according to their actions, are happy for their members to get away with whatever dodgy practice they like.
ANPR accuracy
3.3 ANPR equipment must be maintained and calibrated appropriately to ensure accuracy so as
to ensure that keeper data is not applied for without proper grounds for doing so. Where
there are manufacturer’s guidelines for the maintenance of equipment then this should be
followed.
The requirement to have accurate ANPR has been removed.
Sub Contractors
4.3 If you use sub-contractors or self-ticketing operators then you must ensure that they are
familiar with this code and obtain signed confirmation by them to this effect. You must
ensure that such confirmation is made available to the IPC during any audit or upon request.
The requirement for sub contractors to be familiar with the code has been removed.
Data Protection
5.2 Where required to do so you must provide the IPC with any such records in order that we
may monitor compliance with the Code and any applicable laws.
5.3 Failure to provide any such document(s) within 14 days will be treated as an issue of noncompliance under the Sanctions scheme.
The requirement to allow data protection compliance to be checked has been removed.
Internal Appeals
6.1.d) Allow recipients of a parking charge notice the ability to make representations to you
regarding the issue of the charge.
6.1.d) Allow recipients of a parking charge the ability to make representations to
you regarding the issue of the charge.
It is believed this change is so that operators do not have to allow keepers the right to appeal. This is analysed later.
Changes in terms and conditions
9.1 Where there is any change in the terms and conditions that materially affects the motorist
then you should make these clear on your signage. Where such changes impose liability
where none previously existed then you should consider a grace period to allow regular
visitors to the site to adjust and familiarise themselves with the changes. It is suggested that
a grace period of one month is appropriate and that during this period you should identify
vehicles that would have incurred charges under the new system where they wouldn’t have
previously and inform the driver by notice affixed to the vehicle that in future they will incur
a charge. Vehicles that return having previously had notice of these charges can then be
ticketed in the normal way at your discretion. More guidance on signage is found in
Schedule 1.
This protection has been removed.
Warning and court letters
15. Final Warning Letters
15.1 Where the charge remains unpaid and no appeal is lodged you may send a final
warning letter.
15.2 You must make it clear in the final warning what you will do next if payment is not
received and how payment can be made.
15.3 A final warning letter should not be sent until 14 days have passed since the
notification letter.
16. Court Action or Charge Recovery
16.1 When a final warning has been sent you must wait a further 14 days before you take
further action such as debt recovery or court action.
This requirement has been removed
Grace Periods
17.1 Drivers should be allowed a sufficient amount of time in order to park and read any
signs in order that they may make an informed decision as to whether or not to remain on
the site before any enforcement action is taken by you or your agents.
15.1 Drivers should be allowed a sufficient amount of time to park and read any signs so
they may make an informed decision as to whether or not to remain on the site.
Enforcement action can begin during the grace period.
Notice to Keeper
6.4 The keeper must be told that the process of appealing within your internal appeals process
and the IAS.
The requirement to allow keepers to be able to appeal has been removed. If a keeper appeals a notice to driver, they get this reply:
Later on, when the notice to keeper arrives, the right to appeal is no longer present.
The right of a keeper to appeal is a fundamental protection. It was a clear condition of government that the motorists should have access as a condition of the Protection of Freedoms Act Schedule 4 going live. The Prankster believes that ATA status should be removed from the IPC until the right for keepers to appeal has been restored.
Entrance Signs
Signs must, where practicable, be placed at the entrance to a site.
Signs should, where practicable, be placed at the entrance to a site.
Entrance signage is no longer mandatory. A large number of IPC members do not bother with entrance signage. Standardised entrance signage is an important part of car park management, alerting motorists that terms and conditions apply and so they must look out for further signs. Doing away with this requirement boosts parking charge numbers and increases revenue for operators.
This is another huge retrograde step by the IPC, and shows their intention is not to provide a true car park management service, but to catch motorists out in order to make more money for their members.
Standard Wording
You should endeavour to use the following standard wording on your entrance signs. You should
include a minimum of one phrase from Group A (but no more than 3). Group A text should be before
and more prominent than the Group B text. The signs must direct motorists to the more detailed
signs which display the full terms and conditions. This is important as it is these terms and conditions
that will provide the legal foundation to any charge.
Group A
Pay and display [free for blue badge holders]
[x minutes/hours] free parking [for customers only]
Pay on exit
Pay [on foot/at machine] when leaving
Parking for [business name] customers only
Permit Holders Only
Group B
Charges apply [after this]
Private land
Terms and Conditions Apply
See the notice[s] [in car park] for conditions
This requirement has been removed. The use of standard wording helps motorists.
Text Size
The height of the capital letters in the text from Group A will be dependent on the anticipated
approach speed of traffic. You should have reference to the table below in calculating the text size.
Group B text should be at least 50% of the size of Group A text. All other text should be smaller than
50% of the text from Group A. The name of the site and a welcome message can also be displayed
on the sign but should not detract from the prevalence of the Group A and Group B text.
The sign must be readable from far enough away so that drivers can read all of the Group A and
Group B text without needing to look more than 10 degrees away from the road ahead. Any text on
the sign which is not intended to be read from a moving vehicle can be of a much smaller size.
The size of text on a sign will be determined by a number of factors such as the position of it,
to whom it is aimed and the information that it needs to convey. Text should be of such a size
and in a font that can be easily read by a motorist having regard to the likely position of the
motorist in relation to the sign.
The definition of text size has been removed so that members can use whatever size they like. Large numbers of IPC signs have tiny fonts containing onerous terms and conditions. Allowing their members to hide conditions like this boosts revenue at the expense of motorists.
One of the IPC's biggest customers is Excel Parking/Vehicle Control Services whose signs routinely fail these requirements. At one of their biggest money spinners, Liverpool Airport, the font size is 30mm instead of the previously required 120mm. It is of course, unreadable from a moving vehicle.
Upsetting Excel would be a bad move for the IPC so it is a reasonable guess that this change was a result of a request by them.
Signage in the Dark
If parking enforcement takes place outside of daylight hours, the sign itself is not illuminated or
there is not sufficient ambient lighting, it should be made of retro-reflective material meeting BS EN 12899-1:2007 class RA2 or higher (BS EN 12899-6:2012 class P3 or higher). Dark-coloured areas need not be reflective. You need to ensure that all signs are readable during the hours of enforcement as they form the legal basis of any charge. If signs cannot be read then resulting charges that depend upon their content will not be enforceable.
If parking enforcement takes place outside of daylight hours you should ensure that signs are
illuminated or there is sufficient other lighting. You will need to ensure all signs are readable
during the hours of enforcement as they form the legal basis of any charge.
The requirement to conform to standards has been removed. The pesky condition that unreadable signs cannot be enforced has been removed.
Repeater Signs
You are required to provide a sufficient number of signs on each site commensurate with its size and
other characteristics to ensure that motorists can be under no doubt as to the fact that parking
restrictions exist.
You are required to provide a sufficient number of signs on each site commensurate with its
size and other characteristics to ensure that any parking conditions are adequately brought to
the attention of the motorist.
The requirements for repeater signs have been relaxed.
Other Signs
6) Contain text that is appropriate to the position of the sign and the relative position of the
person who it is aimed at. So, if a sign is at an entrance of a site and the vehicle is likely to be
moving, it must be sufficiently large so as to be clear from within the vehicle having regard
to the likely speed that the vehicle will be travelling at that point.
6) Contain text appropriate to the position of the sign and the relative position of
the person who it is aimed at.
These safeguards have been weakened.
Changes in Operator’s Terms and Conditions
Where there is any change in the terms and conditions that materially affect the motorist then you
should place additional (temporary) signage at the entrance making it clear that new terms and
conditions/charges apply. The signage should be in addition to the signage ordinarily required.
Where there is any change in the terms and conditions materially affecting the motorist you
may place additional (temporary) signage at the entrance making it clear that new terms and
conditions/charges apply, such that regular visitors who may be familiar with the old terms
do not inadvertently incur parking charges. This signage should be in addition to the signage
ordinarily required.
The requirement has been weakened.
Sanctions
Using Predatory Tactics 8-12
Using Predatory Tactics 6-12
Sanction Points have been watered down
Audit
Where an operator has more than 60% of their Parking Charge Notices dismissed on appeal within a
rolling 3 month period, the IPC will investigate the operator and their practices to identify any areas
of non-compliance and will report to the parking operator on their findings. The IPC will usually
endeavour to work with the operator in resolving any compliance issues. The IPC may, whether or
not it assists in resolving issues with the operator, invoke compliance measures where appropriate.
Each year the IPC will randomly select 20-50 Parking Charge Notices issued by an operator to check with compliance with the relevant legislation and the Code of Practice.
Where an operator has more than 60% of their parking charges cancelled on appeal to the IAS
within a rolling 3 month period, the IPC may investigate the operator and their practices to
identify any recurring areas of non-compliance and will report to the parking operator on their
findings. The IPC will usually endeavour to work with the operator in resolving any compliance
issues. The IPC may, whether or not it assists in resolving issues with the operator, invoke
compliance measures where appropriate.
The requirements have been weakened.
Parking Charges
However, if the motorist uses the land other than in accordance with the terms and conditions then
they agree to pay a fixed fee by way of damages to the operator. This is based on a genuine preestimate of loss that flows from the breach of contract by acting otherwise than in accordance with the terms of the agreement the motorist entered into when deciding to park.
All parking charges must be reasonable.
However, if the motorist uses the land in breach of the terms and conditions they thereby agree to pay a fixed fee by way of damages to the operator.
All parking charges must have good legal foundation
The requirement to be a genuine preestimate of loss has been removed. Parking charges noi longer need to be reasonable.
Conclusion
It is obvious that every change has been made to the detriment of the motorist and without good reason. This is what happens when the DVLA allows a rogue ATA to have full control of its code of practice. The Prankster therefore backs the BPA's call for a single industry-wide code of practice, maintained by an independent body.
Until the IPC gets its house in order and reverts back to a fair code of practice, restoring at least signage requirements, and the ability for keepers to appeal, the DVLA should suspend its ATA status.

5298,"Rapid improvements in fire safety have caused a dramatic drop in the number of blazes, according to the National Fire Protection Association. Buildings are constructed with fire-resistant materials; clothing and curtains are made of flame-retardant fabrics; and municipal laws mandate sprinkler systems and smoke detectors. The striking results: On highways, vehicle fires declined 64 percent from 1980 to 2013. Building fires fell 54 percent during that time. There are half as many fires as there were 30 years ago, but about 50 percent more people are paid to fight them. This is no secret. Across the country, cities and towns have been trying to bring firefighting operations in line with the plummeting demand for their services. Many solutions have been attempted: reducing the length of firefighters’ shifts; merging services with neighboring towns; and instituting brownouts, which temporarily take an engine out of service. But often, these efforts have failed against obstinate unions and haven’t reversed the national increase in fire department payrolls. Instead of addressing this municipal waste with patchwork plans to cut overtime and shrink staffs, many cities and towns should consider throwing out the very concept of the career firefighter and return to the tradition of volunteers. For fire departments, building blazes — catastrophic or not — have become infrequent. Firefighters responded to 487,500 structure fires across the United States in 2013, which means each of the nation’s 30,000 fire departments saw just one every 22 days, on average. And yet, taxpayers are paying more people to staff these departments 24/7. As a result, the amount of money shelled out for local fire services more than doubled from 1987 to 2011, to $44.8 billion, accounting for inflation. To be fair, fire departments have shouldered additional responsibility since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and are expected to have the training and equipment necessary to respond to various types of terrorism, including biological and chemical attacks. Still, in a November report, the National Fire Protection Association blamed the surge in fire department funding on ballooning staffs, overtime pay and retirement and health benefits — things that have nothing to do with the threat of terrorism. Firefighters earned a median salary of $45,250 in 2012, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, but overtime can more than double that. Exorbitant overtime costs are fueled by union-negotiated minimum-staffing levels that often mandate four firefighters per engine be on duty at all times, regardless of the cost or workload. At the national level, the International Association of Fire Fighters has an annual budget of nearly $60 million, most of it derived from its 278,000 members. IAFF calls itself “one of the most active lobbying organizations in Washington,” advocating for pension, safety and overtime laws. Its political action committee, FIREPAC, spent nearly $6.4 million in 2014, according to OpenSecrets.org . The union’s constitution forbids members from serving as volunteer firefighters, under penalty of fines or expulsion. Page 2 of 2 - Today, fewer than 4 percent of fire department calls are for fires. Meanwhile, requests for medical aid more than quadrupled between 1980 and 2013, to more than 21 million, according to the National Fire Prevention Association. In other words, for every structure fire a fire department responds to, it receives 44 medical calls, on average. So “fire” department has become a misnomer. In practice, these agencies have become emergency medical responders. The problem with that? Most communities already have ambulance services, whose staffs are less expensive and more highly trained in medical aid. Many cities mandate that their firefighters be certified EMTs, which requires about 120 to 150 hours of training in basic emergency medical care. That’s far less than the up to 1,800 hours of training for the paramedics who staff emergency medical services. Yet paramedics are cheaper than firefighters, earning a median of $31,020 in 2012. Still, you’ll often see a large ladder truck respond to medical calls along with an ambulance, resulting in multiple uniformed cadres when just one person needs attention. To justify this, firefighters have touted themselves as “first responders” who can answer a medical emergency faster than paramedics in an ambulance. But when they arrive without the training and equipment to deal with severe medical emergencies, they are of little use. Recognizing the overlap, some cities have merged their fire and EMS services, over union objections. Some require that all members of the newly combined agency be certified to respond to both types of crisis, which improves efficiency and lowers costs. But other cities have struggled to merge the cultures and operations of the departments. About 69 percent of all firefighters in the country are volunteers. It is mainly larger cities and towns that have been burdened by union staffing and salary demands that are incompatible with their declining firefighting needs. The number of volunteer firefighters fell by 3 percent in the time paid firefighters grew by nearly 50 percent. This is not to say that our largest cities could operate with volunteer firefighters alone. Sheer population size may necessitate a core group of full-timers. But payrolls certainly shouldn’t be growing as fires are decreasing. Nor is this to say that professional firefighters are not heroic. They are and have repeatedly proved as much, most notably during the Sept. 11 attacks. But volunteers also are capable of such bravery. When we entrusted them with protecting our largest cities from blazes, they showed up and courageously put their lives on the line. Today, heroism isn’t what our firefighting services need most. As the risk of massive infernos declines, what we really need is to rethink our entire firefighting model — and how much we should be paying for it. Fred S.

5161,"Baltimore Ravens (0-0)
at
Denver Broncos (0-0)
BACKGROUND

In the national media, the Baltimore Ravens are a popular pick to go to the Super Bowl this year. That same national media doesn't seem to know what to make of the Denver Broncos. The recently dominant Broncos seem as though they might be poised to come back to the pack.

I am not so sure, but I understand the questions. Was the end-of-the-season Peyton Manning an injured player or a player showing his age? Can Manning and new coach Gary Kubiak co-exist? Will the Denver defense be one of the best editions of this unit ever?

Here's what I think: Manning, though older, is still a Top Ten (at minimum) quarterback. Kubiak and Manning are smart dudes and they will put together an offense that might look different from we've seen from the Broncos in recent years but will be an efficient scoring machine. CJ Anderson will have a break out season and Von Miller will dominate the league.

It all starts in this game. Manning has been brilliant in openers. Joe Flacco doesn't have many quality targets to throw to and Denver's defense looks hungry out of the gate.

KEY MATCH UP

This has to be the revamped Denver offensive line vs. the typically monstrous defensive line of the Ravens. If Manning gets a lot of pressure up-the-middle, it could be a long afternoon for the orange and blue. That said, Kubiak's zone blocking system has been successful wherever he's been and it's difficult to pin back your ears and gun for Manning if Anderson is gashing you for 5 and 10 yards at a clip.

X-FACTOR

Emmanuel Sanders debuts this weekend as the Broncos' punt returner and I wouldn't be surprised to see him take a punt to the house. He's an exciting player and electric with the ball.

PREDICTION

Denver will be a work in progress on offense for a while, but I think they will have themselves together enough to handle a Ravens team that doesn't always perform well on the road.

 Air Freight   
   
 
Changi Airport Group (CAG) welcomes AirBridgeCargo Airlines (ABC) to Singapore Changi Airport, with its inaugural flight from Moscow, Russia, scheduled to arrive tonight. The international freighter carrier, which is part of Russia-based Volga-Dnepr Group, is launching twice-weekly Moscow-Singapore-Hong Kong-Moscow services with a Boeing 747-8F aircraft. ABC’s new services to Singapore establish Moscow as a new freighter city link for Changi Airport, and strengthen Changi Airport’s connectivity to Russia and beyond. 
 
The new dedicated cargo services to Singapore will facilitate the movement of cross-border shipments and enhance the country’s product offerings for its customers in Asia. With the addition of Singapore, which is ABC’s ninth online station in Asia, the airline will now provide over 500 weekly delivery solutions from the region, all with a delivery time of below 48 hours including handling procedures. The airline already has a diverse business portfolio in the region, connecting clients in China, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam with its cargo gateways in Europe, the USA and Russia. 
 
Robert van de Weg, ABC’s Senior Vice President, Sales & Marketing, said: “The ABC team is pleased to start connecting customers in Europe, the USA and Singapore with dedicated freighter services to Changi Airport. With the addition of this route, ABC is continuing its strategy to provide customers with better access to point-to-point deliveries within its global route network, while providing them with on-time, reliable and high quality service levels. Singapore, via ABC’s Moscow hub, will be directly connected to gateways like Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Milan without trucking. Asia is a vitally important market for ABC and we look forward to further growth in this dynamic region.” 
 
CAG’s Assistant Vice President for Cargo & Logistics Development, James Fong, added: “This new service by ABC marks a significant milestone for Changi Airport as it opens up new cargo opportunities between Singapore and Russia. Logistics players, who were previously limited by capacity constraints between Singapore and Russia, now have a direct option to transport large freight shipments as well as general cargo between the two countries. The enhanced air connectivity will foster further trade between both countries which is already growing steadily.” 
 
Changi Airport is one of the world’s busiest cargo hubs. In the first half of 2015, cargo throughput at Changi Airport reached 912,300 tonnes. During this period, 1,034 tonnes of cargo was handled between Singapore and Russia. Between 2010 and 2014, air cargo volumes between Singapore and Russia grew by an average growth rate of 16% annually.

It must surely be the ultimate resort. No other word could do full justice to Fregate Island in the Seychelles, as ecological and nurturing of wildlife as it is luxuriously exotic. 

It's a place for honeymooners and second-honeymooners, for celebrating anniversaries, birthdays that end with a nought, for any of those extra-special, once-in-a-lifetime holidays that come tied up with a romantic red bow. 

We were flagging a bit after a connecting flight in Dubai at dawn, but what was another couple of hours of flying when our destination was a group of islands scattered like stars in the middle of the Indian Ocean? Any travel weariness fell away fast. 
 
Fregate Island in the Seychelles is as well known for its ecological preservation as its exotic luxury 

At Mahe international airport on the largest of the Seychelles islands, we were whisked through passport control and into a waiting helicopter, lifting off almost instantly for the 15-minute flight. Fregate doesn't do things by halves. 

The depths and shallows of the sea below us were mapped out in a rainbow of blues – inky, indigo and azure. I almost felt able to make out the darting fish. 

Then the white fringes and forest-green interior of Fregate Island came into view, looming out of a wispy ring of sea mist; it looked remote from the world, like a Desert Island Discs island, a mirage. 

Yet this is a mirage with a helipad, a landing strip, harbour, yacht club and a tiny historic chapel – not to mention sumptuous villas, each with an infinity pool, Jacuzzi, large sun terrace and shaded double day-bed. 
 
Each of the gorgeous villas on the island comes complete with an infinity pool, Jacuzzi and private beach 

Our villa was perched on a clifftop looking out over a sapphire sea, and a more romantic home for five days was hard to imagine. Rough-hewn steps led down to a tiny private beach where the sand was white and soft like tropical snow. 
  TRAVEL FACTS  
Africa Travel (africatravel.co.uk, 020 7843 3500) offers five nights at Fregate Island from £6,975pp.  

This includes return Emirates flights from London, Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle or Glasgow, onward helicopter transfers, all meals, drinks, laundry, and nonmotorised activities. 
  
We had a butler, Jared, to look after us. He drove us everywhere in a buggy or we were free to drive it ourselves. He was from Mombasa and seemed chuffed to hear that I knew the Kenyan coast quite well; we were soon swapping stories of the joys of Kilifi Creek and of fearsome snakes – Jared's encounters were certainly closer and more deadly than mine. 

Showing us round the three-room villa, he explained its delights and luxuries – the flat-screen TVs, the music system, the outside and indoor showers – then suggested we must be ready for some food. He was right. It was mid-afternoon, a long time since our airline tray. 
 
Sandra Howard visited the island with her husband, calling Fregate the 'ultimate' resort 

Meals, we soon discovered, could be taken whenever and wherever we chose: at Plantation House – the restored home of the island's original 19th Century planter that had a little museum attached – in The Pirate's Bar, the library, on any of the island's seven beaches, or even in a splendid treehouse high up in a banyan tree. 

Jared wanted to bring whatever we fancied to the villa, but we chose to explore the Fregate House restaurant adjacent to the reception and boutique, effectively the island's hub.  

We ate delicious seafood and crab salads while marvelling at the view, before taking the steps down through terraced gardens and passing the two main pools on the way to the beach. It was exquisite, with loungers and towels and a beach bar. Best of all, we had the place to ourselves. 

The watchword of Fregate is privacy: it is in the island's DNA. This wouldn't be the perfect holiday destination for clubbers, but nature-lovers, paparazzi-shy celebrities, honeymooners – who can request a distant villa – and seekers of sun and solitude would all be in seventh heaven. 

Families, too, would love it. The island, three miles square and the most isolated of the Seychelles granite islands, has species unique to its shores and is a natural playground. 
 
Around the island, 2,000 giant Aldabra tortoises roam free and there is a nursery dedicated to their protection 

About 2,000 giant Aldabra tortoises roam free, and during a tour of the island we were shown the nursery for the protection of the vulnerable baby tortoises. Children can adopt one of the older ones (with a little parental sponsorship), name it and then release it back into the forest. 

'The kids love to come back a year or two later and look for their chosen junior,' we were told. 'We can't honestly swear that the one they've seen is George, Henry or Elton, but they'll gladly believe it's theirs!' 

We were shown a sign by the steps down to one of the beaches, Anse Maquereau, which read In Use. There was a telephone down there too, so as well as being private, you could ring for service. 

Our island tour had begun with a history lesson, taking us back a few million years to when India parted from Africa and floated north, leaving 115 scattered fragments that were to form the Seychelles. 
 
Fregate has also saved the Seychelles magpie robin - a rare bird - from extinction 

They were uninhabited until the 15th Century, when pirates became the first settlers – the famous Olivier Levasseur, 'La Buse', is said to have buried his treasure here, but it has still to be found. 

The ancient tortoises provided meat and were almost wiped out over time, though happily numbers are healthier now, for which Fregate, committed to conservation, can take much of the credit. 

Fregate has also saved the Seychelles magpie robin, one of the rarest birds in existence, from virtual extinction. It was the only place in the world where they could be found and numbers were down to seven pairs. Now you see them all over the island. 

They are cute, cocky little birds – like a mini magpie, yet with none of a magpie's mean habits. We shared our sunny outdoor breakfasts with a covey of them every morning, along with a battery of other cheeky birds. 

We learned a lot about the local birds, including the endemic Seychelles white-eye, another endangered species, and we fell in love with a brilliant little fellow, the Madagascar fody. Its black-ringed eyes distinguished it from the Seychelles fody who, as my husband Michael put it, seemed to have forgotten to apply its mascara. The tiny male fody turns vermillion when mating, which seemed to be most of the time. 

As well as our tour, we went on a nature walk with Carl, one of the conservation team. He told us about the ground doves eating the fallen fermenting figs from the banyan trees and becoming tipsy – we enjoyed seeing them rolling around like drunken sailors on the paths. Carl plucked an enormous beetle off a tree and rested it on the back of his hand. 

'This,' he said, 'is the giant tenebrionid beetle, unique to Fregate and critically endangered. He's our signature species and we're extremely proud to be saving him.' Carl explained that the island was now rat-free, and the lack of predators was vital to the conservation plans. 
 
As well as enjoying the stunning white sand (pictured), Sandra and her husband also explored the chef's organic market garden 

Fregate has an organic market garden, the pride and joy of chef Arnaud. He oversees all the planting and rotation, sells surplus produce to Mahe, and experiments with exotic new seeds.  

He gave us a tour as well; up and down the rows of passion fruit, pawpaws, bell peppers, tomatoes – in fact every variety of fruit and vegetable you could name. He tested us on a few herbs. I'm the cook of the family, yet Michael scored better than I did.  

Arnaud's dishes were light and innovative. He prepared lunch using just-picked ingredients and, seated under a dainty pergola that Jared had erected for shade, we had an unbeatably healthy meal. 

The night before, Jared and Arnaud had surprised us with a softly lit, romantic dinner à deux in the atmospheric library. We felt like a pair of honeymooning potentates (at our age?) and the menu was something else: yellow cherry tomato gazpacho; scallops flambeed with vermouth and served with oregano risotto; lobster mousse with caramelised fennel and a light lobster bisque; and a passion fruit sorbet for dessert. 

On another night, Fregate's Creole chef, David, barbecued lobsters for us on a beach that was ours alone. We had a balmy stroll by the lapping waves, lounged in deckchairs while drinking cocktails and watching the rich red sun go down, before moving over to a candle-lit table with flowers and a crisp white cloth. Jared lit a small wigwam-style bonfire, the stars were out, the lobsters were meltingly tender, and a calorific Creole banana dessert was sinful to say the least. 

But we did more than gorge on scrumptious food. There was almost too much to do in such a short space of time, including snorkelling with hawksbill turtles. 
 
After deep sea fishing, guests can indulge in a therapeutic massage at Fregate's picturesque spa 

On another morning we went deep-sea fishing, first meeting James – the island's oldest giant tortoise who is much loved by everyone – by the marina. He is so tame that he takes titbits from your hands and has been known to clamber up over people like a dog greeting its master. 

The fish weren't quite as obliging – we didn't catch anything – but we sailed round a granite island with its amazing rock formations, I swam in the exquisitely clear waters, and life felt pretty good. 

And afterwards, what could beat an indulgently therapeutic massage at a top spa? Ornamental ponds, lemongrass tea to greet us, fragrant aromas: oils of the local ylang-ylang fruit gently applied. Three hours in the hedonistic couples' room took my fancy. There's also a Chocolate Lovers Bliss, where the body is smothered with warm velvety Belgian chocolate, which stimulates circulation and is full of antioxidants, though that's probably one for the honeymooners… 

Fregate has a slogan: Anything, Anytime, Anywhere. It's a fitting mantra. The island has just had a major refurbishment, and it's a haven devoted to conservation and luxury. 

With winter on the way, we are already thinking back to our five heavenly days there, the scintillating water, tropical sun and sumptuous meals, the fabulous views of the Indian Ocean. It was a place of sensuous serenity.

1565,"Costco Customer Experience Example  
It was an ordinary work day filled with phone conferences and content creation. Hours spent on the phone and on my computer all focused on teaching companies how to make more money by building better relationships with their customers. 
 
Imagine my surprise, no delight, when I opened up an ordinary envelope from Costco in the mail. I could feel that there is a card in the envelope so I figured there was a new membership card enclosed. 
 
Instead, there was a letter with a cash card. 
 
Apparently, a shirt that I purchased for my husband for father’s day was in fact not 100% silk as it had been labeled. Costco took the initiative to notify everyone who had purchased this specific shirt and give a $20 cash card for each shirt purchased. They ALSO provided the option to return the shirt as well if we were not satisfied with it. They made sure to include a statement to specify that we were free to keep the cash card even if we decided to return the shirt. 
 
They apologized and expressed appreciation for our continued loyalty. 
 
The first words out of my mouth were “I will continue to do business with Costco FOREVER.” This was amazing. 
 
In a world where companies are quick to hide behind policies, or hide the issue completely, Costco decided to bring it to MY attention and make it BETTER THAN RIGHT before I even knew there was an issue to be concerned about. 
 
This is an example that we should all try to live up to both professionally and personally. It’s a simple premise really. Just be forthcoming and honest with your customers and they’ll appreciate it. Do it well, and they’ll be loyal to you. 
 
Now, I fully understand that there is likely a backstory that I’m sure involved a lot of rigmarole (yes, that’s how you spell it, I looked it up) and hard decisions. This is an especially notable response to the issue since I don’t remember this shirt costing a full $ 20. But the company made the decision to stand behind their products, found that this one didn’t measure up to what had been advertised, and took more than full responsibility for it. As a consumer, I really do appreciate that. 
 
As a Customer Experience Expert, I’m so delighted to see large companies setting the example. It truly comes down to the premise I try to live by. 
 
Do the right thing. Always.

1427,"(RTTNews.com) - The Taiwan stock market moved higher again on Tuesday, one session after it had snapped the three-day winning streak in which it had climbed more than 200 points or 2.3 percent. The Taiwan Stock Exchange settled just above the 8,365-point plateau, although the market is likely to see renewed consolidation on Wednesday.

The global forecast for the Asian markets is soft, thanks to ongoing uncertainty over interest rates and trouble for auto giant Volkswagen. The European and U.S. markets ended firmly in the red and the Asian bourses figure to open in similar fashion.

The TSE finished modestly higher on Tuesday, bumped into the green by support from the technology stocks.

For the day, the index climbed 58.88 points or 0.71 percent to finish at the daily high of 8,365.92 after trading as low as 8,325.78 on turnover of 69.27 billion Taiwan dollars.

HTC Corp. led the gainers with a 3.1 percent jump.

The lead from Wall Street is broadly negative as stocks were stuck firmly in the red throughout Tuesday - more than offsetting the gains in the previous sessions.

The Dow slumped 179.72 points or 1.1 percent to 16,330.47, while the NASDAQ plunged 72.23 points or 1.5 percent to 4,756.72 and the S&P 500 tumbled 24.23 points or 1.2 percent to 1,942.74.

The sell-off was partly attributed to ongoing uncertainty about the outlook for U.S. monetary policy. Following last week's Federal Reserve decision to leave interest rates unchanged, traders are questioning when the central bank will eventually raise rates.

Concerns that auto giant Volkswagen could face a massive fine for cheating on emissions tests contributed the sell-off by European stocks.

Closer to home, Taiwan will see August numbers for commercial sales and industrial production later today.

Sales are tipped to fall 3.7 percent on year after slipping 4.42 percent in July. Output is called lower by an annual 2.9 percent after falling 2.99 percent in the previous month.

4871,"A poem by Roy Hasan (pictured), a Mizrahi leftist criticising the Ashkenazi Left for being hypersensitive to Palestinian historical grievances against the Israeli state, but dismissive of the religious, cultural, and historical grievances of Mizrahi Jews, is getting hundreds of 'shares' online. Hasan inveighs against 'Arsophobia', the Ashkenazi prejudice against the Israeli equivalent of  'Chav' - people of  low education and social class. Article by Madison Margolin in the Forward:
Roy Hasan has been described as the Israeli Eminem. The subversive, indignant, radical 32-year-old Mizrahi poet from a housing project outside Haifa received the prestigious Bernstein Prize and an award of 50,000 NIS from the Israeli Publishers Association this past July.
His provocative poem “ If There’ll Be Peace, All the Arsim Will Come ” sheds light on the complex dynamic in Israel between the white Jewish left and Mizrahim, Jews of Middle Eastern descent. The poem calls out Ashkenazim — Jews of European origins — for “hypocrisy, hegemony, and all around ass-hole-itude,” as it has been described by the radio station TLV1.
“In order to fully understand [the poem] you need to have grown up here or live the reality of Israeli society,” Hasan told me in an email exchange.
The poem focuses on local, everyday Israel through Hasan’s point of view. He criticizes privileged “socialists” who participate in capitalism, and leftist atheists who scorn religious Judaism, but ostensibly respect Islam.
“I just love those / sensitive Jews who demonstrate against the Occupation / and go home to their / Arab house in Yaffo / which they call Yaffa / with a melancholy glance of / shared fate over hummus / at Abu something-or-other / licking their lips with every / wipe of the pita and / murmuring about ending the Occupation, / dreaming of two states for two nations / because— walla —/ (they fumble for the Arabic) / Occupation Occupation / (or nakba nakba ): / next to them but not with them / they’re Arabs after all. / An Arab friend said about them once / that they’ll never make peace / because if there’ll be peace / all the arsim will come.” 
Mizrahim, or “Arab Jews” as many call themselves, already comprise more than half the Israeli population. “Peace will mean that all the Arabs will come, and then the country will be full of arsim,” Hasan said, explaining the last stanza.
To understand the poem is to comprehend the meaning of “ars” (plural: “arsim”) and its fraught significance in Israeli society and politics. “Ars” is a widely known derogatory and racist term in Hebrew slang often used to describe young Mizrahim of low socioeconomic status. Derived from Arabic, “ars” originally meant “pimp,” “shepherd,” or “bad guy.” In English, it’s comparable to “thug.” The female counterpart is “frecha” (plural: “frechot”), a term borrowed from a Moroccan first name popular in the 1950s and ’60s.
“I would say there’s ‘arsophobia,’” said Henriette Dahan Kalev, a professor of politics and gender at Ben Gurion University. “Ars” is a politically loaded word, but now many Mizrahim are reclaiming it, she explained. “It’s like reclaiming the word ‘queer’ in English.”
Dahan said that creative protest like Hasan’s has always been on the margins of the main discourse in Israel, overshadowed by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or inter-party politics in the Knesset.
“As someone who holds radical leftist views I am constantly facing an internal struggle,” said Hasan, “and I know that until a different kind of left is created here, one that understands the complexities and the ethnic Israeli-Arab diversity and can allow people from the bottom rungs of society to reach the top, I will never have a real political home.”
As Hasan’s translator Ron Makleff points out, his poem addresses the fact that the Ashkenazi left has continually failed to win a majority in the Knesset and bring about change.
But the poem also calls into question the place of Mizrahi identity in terms of the conflict itself, explained Makleff, a historian at UC Berkeley. With many Mizrahim willing to call themselves “Arab Jews,” he said, “the binary of national identities in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict becomes more complex.”
Especially for a non-Hebrew speaking audience, the poem bluntly broaches complexities that are crucial to understanding Israel today, said Makleff. While our grandparents’ generation brought the idea that “we are all just Israeli,” a few generations in, that idea is falling apart, he said.
“I think the poem’s importance is in its criticism of how the secular Ashkenazi left is simultaneously hypersensitive to Palestinian historical grievances against the Israeli state, but dismissive of the religious, cultural, and historical grievances of Mizrahi Jews against the Israeli state,” said Makleff. “The poem juxtaposes those two aspects of old-school Ashkenazi leftism in a way which, to me, reveals just how deeply implicated that Ashkenazi left is in creating an unequal, occupying, intolerant Israel.”

4607,"Here are five movies from various platforms families may want to consider. Because not all are appropriate for younger children, age recommendations are included. 
  
Hollywood often turns to real-life events as subject matter to take to the big screen, as with the recently released ""Everest."" Here are five films based on true stories that carry emotional impact. 
 
In theaters: 'Everest' 
 
A group of climbers gets caught in a severe snow storm while on Mount Everest. MovieGuide.org calls the film “a stunning, thrilling, tragic true story.” The website states that while anyone familiar with the real-life events that inspired the film knows it “isn’t a totally happy movie,” the film still contains “inspiring moral points” as “people risk their lives, love their families and try to inspire others.” Objectionable content is minimal but intense peril is shown throughout, so caution is advised. Ok.com recommends the film for viewers ages 13 and older. 
 
Amazon Instant: 'Miracle' 
 
A hockey coach leads the U.S. team to an unlikely victory against the Soviet Union during the 1980 Winter Olympics.

1554,"QUINTE WEST -   
There’s a lot at stake Oct. 19. 
 
Political parties, and more importantly voters, all have one thing in common, and that’s priorities, whether it be lower taxes, infrastructure investment or providing better care for veterans. 
 
Tom Kupecz now works on the civilian side of the street, helping to ensure veterans are well treated. 
 
The retired Lt. Colonel spent the  bulk of his 42-year career in the Royal Canadian Air Force flying fighter jets – both the CF-100 and CF-5. 
 
A few weeks ago, Kupecz was waving a protest placard in front of Trenton Memorial Hospital. 
 
Kupecz, who owns a consulting firm with his wife, is a member of Our TMH. He’s spent months studying other community hospitals and how they operate independently from their larger, corporate cousins. 
 
Kupecz is also one of the key movers behind a plan to add a veterans’ care centre to the hospital. 
 
The idea has received attention from federal leaders and candidates of all political stripes. 
 
Kupecz said veterans have always come back from foreign deployments with health issues largely misunderstood or misdiagnosed. 
 
“It’s encouraging to see the initiatives that have been started in terms of veterans’ care. They are wonderful. To keep emphasizing that, we need to make sure veterans who have health issues get the very best care. And, to my mind, that means making sure they have a secure income and secure support system, with effective programs to get that support when they need it,” he said. 
 
Kupecz spent about 14 years outside the country. He is also an Afghan war vet. 
 
“As a veteran I feel it’s important that we contribute to our alliances, as we’ve done with the United Nations in the past, and stepping up to the plate when it comes to international issues. At the same time we need to support refugees and send money to all causes that are helping people around the world. International and aid support is quite important to me,” he said. 
 
Red Shark Men’s Wear has been a fixture in downtown Trenton since 1970. 
 
Owner Shane O’Shaughnessy has seen a lot of other businesses come and go over the decades. He’s also seen the good and the bad when it comes to the economy, but always managed to hang on and make a good living. 
 
“Look at it this way, if the economy was good right now I wouldn’t be having a buy one, get two free sale,” said O’Shaughnessy. 
 
But O’Shaughnessy does what he has to in order to ride out the downturn, or technical recession as he describes the state of the current economic climate. 
 
The business owner says it’s time for the federal government to inject more cash into the economy. 
 
“People have to realize the more that’s flipped over is good. Even if that’s tax money.” 
 
Balancing the budget, he said, isn’t the answer, at least not right now. 
 
“Balanced budgets are wonderful if the economy is booming, but the economy hasn’t been booming in a very long time. In a technical recession there’s always the risk of stagnating the economy even more by cutting programs and taking other fiscal measures in order to balance the budget. What we need now is more investment by the government,” said O’Shaughnessy. 
 
A pragmatist, O’Shaughnessy says there’s no easy fix. 
 
Lowering tax rates, he said, isn’t always the answer. He says the current tax structure is “fair.” 
 
“What governments need to do is stop being wasteful. It’s not that Canadians don’t mind paying taxes. We all need health care. We need infrastructure. What we don’t need government to do is waste money,” said O’Shaughnessy. 
 
O’Shaughnessy said part of the problem is the current government has hung the economy on the price of oil. 
 
“It’s a wonderful thing if oil prices are rising, but terrible if they’re not. Our dollar is falling. Our economy is falling. We pegged our dollar so high that every other manufacturing job has gone to another country. The U.S. is ramping up. They are doing a lot better than we are. There’s a lot of distrust with the government,” he said. 
 
Most municipal leaders will tell you when it comes to federal spending, cash for infrastructure is always at the top of the list. 
 
“When isn’t it at the top of the list?” said Mayor Jim Harrison. 
 
The city is in the midst of a massive $70 million overhaul of Trenton’s waste water treatment facility. About $30 million will be spent this year. 
 
The city has received more than $3 million in funding for the project. 
 
“But we have a long way to go before it’s completed. Any support will be greatly appreciated,” said Harrison. 
 
But that isn’t the only project. 
 
“We’ve got a lot of underground infrastructure that needs to be replaced. As far as I’m concerned, infrastructure is the number one concern,” said Harrison. 
 
Infrastructure isn’t the only issue in town. 
 
“We want the government to continue the work that’s been done at CFB Trenton,” said Harrison. 
 
Harrison said the major political parties are addressing the infrastructure deficit, the Liberals and Conservative more so. He said the Conservative government has spent a lot of money in Quinte West, and followed that up by saying the Liberals have also committed to infrastructure funding. 
 
“I’ve talked to the candidates to make sure they follow through on their commitments,” he said. “But funding hasn’t gone far enough. We’ll push them to make sure they go beyond the envelope to help make sure our needs are met. All infrastructure is important to us. It helps us grow and makes the city a better, and safer place to live.”

1656,"After decades of marriage, we’ve figured out a few things. Here are seven actions that have helped make our marriage work. 1. Put a sock in it. Not in your mate’s mouth — in your own. When you’re annoyed by your spouse, don’t automatically spout off with, “How many times do I have to tell you to ... ?” Give things a chance to cool down. Mostly you will find that ignoring a few unimportant things pays off. You’ve heard the saying, “Don’t make a mountain out of a mole hill.” It applies to a lot of silly situations in marriage. There is nothing to be gained by making a big deal out of something that is simply not worth the fight. Ask yourself, will this even matter tomorrow? Most things won’t. 2. Buck up and take the blame. When you’ve done something stupid or unkind, apologize for it. Be responsible for your mistakes and step forward in a better direction. Only when people acknowledge their part in a problem can change happen. Along with this, be forgiving when your mate apologizes. Holding a grudge in marriage is a catastrophe waiting to happen. Don’t let ill feelings build up. Apologize and forgive. Then hug. 3. Kiss like there’s no tomorrow. Savor those kisses. Keep them coming, daily -- several times a day. Never be too busy to greet each other with a kiss, one that is filled with honeymoon-type passion. This will stoke your romantic fires and keep your hearts warm for all the years of your lives, especially when the words “I love you” are spoken along with those kisses. 4. Work like the devil to stay out of debt. Too much debt is an enemy to marriage. Any debt is a burden. Some experts say there are two purchases that warrant their monthly payments — a house and a car. When you do stick your neck out for these items, make sure to keep it within your budget. Think, what would we do if we lost our jobs? That will help you be wiser in your purchases. Pay these debts off as quickly as possible. For other things you think you can’t live without, save up. Paying cash will save you a ton of interest and make it possible for you to have more of the things your really want and need. 5. Get giddy over making your spouse happy. Think of things you can do that will put a big smile on your honey’s face. You know what she or he likes, so make it happen — often. It doesn’t have to be much. Making the bed in the morning, going for a walk together, getting excited over your mate’s promotion, snuggling the kiddies, helping with their care, noticing how cute your wife looks and telling her, or how handsome he looks and telling him. We all love compliments, especially from the ones we love most. Do everything in your power to help your mate feel those happy feelings. Page 2 of 2 - 6. Be an elephant when it comes to remembering important dates. It’s simple nowadays. All you have to do is program it into your smart phone or computer. Easy peasy. Just do it. Always remember your wedding anniversary and your mate’s birthday. Those are a must. Think about ways to spoil your spouse, even if it's just with one rose, or one package of BBQ ribs. Do something to make the day special for her or him. Make it as nice as your wallet can handle. Think about it beforehand, even plan together in advance for a special date. Looking forward can be as fun as the actual happening. 7. Kick the word divorce out of your vocabulary. When it comes to your relationship, that word is an absolute no-no. You don’t even use it in jest. Make the decision together that your marriage is going to last. Be committed — both of you — verbally to each other. Then stand by that commitment all the days of your life. And not only stand by it, but make it happen by showing respect, loyalty and love for each other in all you do. Then the lasting will be joyful. This is not an all-inclusive list. So many more things can be a blessing to your marriage. Take a minute and list a few of the ones that have helped strengthen your marriage. Then express appreciation to your spouse for doing his or her part in helping your marriage blossom into the beautiful relationship it is becoming.",ed17304d-81f1-4329-bc5b-ac381e5223e5,News,2015-09-13T14:09:49Z,GalvaNews.com,7 reasons why our marriage works -- and how to make yours work too,0.0,News
2515,"Fast bowler James Pattinson hopes his two-year battle to get fit has only improved his game. 

Leeds: James Pattinson hopes his recent appearance for Australia alongside Mitch Starc and Pat Cummins heralds the start of something lasting, with a rare appearance by all three simultaneously fit and well.

Fast-bowler Pattinson was wicketless from six overs in his comeback to international cricket on Tuesday. Nevertheless, he was happy with his pace and, more significantly, that he was able to put into practice the remedial tweaks to his bowling action he needs to ease pressure on his back.

""They are [coming naturally]. That was a big goal of mine,"" he said. ""Last year I was still thinking about my action.

""Now my attention has gone away from that to actually concentrating on the batter and trying to find a way of getting the batter out.""

He is more relaxed about the future. ""I think you can get caught up in wanting everything to happen now. But look at someone like Mitchell Johnson, who debuted at my age, at 25, he's had a great career.

""As a fast bowler you've got to look to the future a bit and know that most fast-bowlers go until they're 35, and for me that's 10 years away.

""I've just got to build everything up and build up a really solid foundation, which I've done in the gym over the last couple of years. Hopefully it allows me to play a lot of cricket now.""

Pattinson has made only one Test appearance since being withdrawn midway through the 2013 Ashes after injuring his back. In that next appearance in 2014, in Cape Town against South Africa, he played an important role in Australia's victory but suffered another back injury that forced him again on to the sidelines.

The 25-year-old hopes his two-year hiatus has been good for his game.

""It might be a blessing in disguise. Hopefully it gives me an extra two years at the back end of my career when I really will know my game,"" he said.

Pattinson, Starc and Cummins each made their Test debut within a fortnight of each other in late 2011: Cummins in Cape Town against South Africa, Pattinson and Starc in Brisbane against New Zealand.

All three – less so Starc – have battled injury, which has helped build camaraderie between them as they sought to support each other during their stints on the sidelines.

Pattinson hopes they are now at a point where they can build camaraderie through their shared on-field experiences.

""Hopefully now we're hitting that mid-20s mark . . . we can try and play some real consistent cricket together and really work on our games together,"" he said.

""That's the [crucial] thing – it's hard to learn and improve your game when you're not playing. The big thing for me now is to try and get better by playing games and being in those situations.""

3561,"This study demonstrates the potential for the essential oil of Ca. odorata essential oil to be used as a botanical insecticide against three mosquito species.	- GreenMedInfo Summary Abstract Title: Efficacy of essential oil from Cananga odorata (Lamk.) Hook.f.&Thomson (Annonaceae) against three mosquito species Aedes aegypti (L.), Anopheles dirus (Peyton and Harrison), and Culex quinquefasciatus (Say).
Abstract Source: Parasitol Res. 2015 Sep 4. Epub 2015 Sep 4. PMID: 26337270
Abstract Author(s): Mayura Soonwera
Article Affiliation: Mayura Soonwera
Abstract: The essential oil of Cananga odorata flowers was evaluated for oviposition-deterrent, ovicidal, insecticidal, and repellent activities toward three mosquito species: Aedes aegypti, Anopheles dirus, and Culex quinquefasciatus. Oviposition deterrence of the oil was evaluated on gravid females using oviposition deterrence bioassay. The results showed that 10 % Ca. odorata exhibited high percent effective repellency against oviposition at 99.4 % to Ae. aegypti, 97.1 % to An. dirus, and 100 % to Cx. quinquefasciatus. Ca. odorata oil was tested for ovicidal activity. Regression equations revealed that the ovicidal rates were positively correlated withthe concentrations of the essential oil. As the concentration of essential oil increased from 1, 5, and up to 10 % concentration, the ovicidal rate increased accordingly. Larvicidal activity of the oils was used on immature stages (third and fourth instar lavae and pupae). The maximum larval mortality was found with 10 % Ca. odorata against immature stages, and there were LC50 values ranged from 10.4 to 10.5 % (for Ae. aegypti),1 % (for An. dirus), and1 % (for Cx. quinquefasciatus). Adulticidal properties were evaluated with unfed females. Ten percent Ca. odorata oil had high knockdown rates against the three mosquito species at 96 % (for Ae. aegypti), 98.4 % (for An. dirus), and 100 % (for Cx. quinquefasciatus), with EC50 values of 6.2, 4.7,and 5.4 %, respectively. It gave moderate mortality rates after 24 and 48 h of exposure. Ca. odorata oil was assessed for repellency to females by using the modified K&D module. Ten percent Ca. odorata oil gave the strongest value against Ae. aegypti, An. dirus, and Cx. quinquefasciatus, with percentage repellency of 66, 92, and 90 %, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential for the essential oil of Ca. odorata essential oil to be used as a botanical insecticide against three mosquito species.	Article Published Date : Sep 04, 2015

(WNFL) - Jared Abbrederis has missed all of training camp since suffering a concussion on day number one. Abbrederis returned to practice on Tuesday, the same day that the Packers are required to trim their roster from 83 to 75 players. The former fifth-round draft pick has yet to play a preseason game with the Packers after being injured early in training camp last season and landing on injured reserve. The Packers must decide whether or not Abbrederis can contribute to the team this season and if he is a better option than Myles White. White is hanging on to the fifth spot on the depth chart at the moment, after catching nine passes for 89 yards in last Saturday's preseason loss to Philadelphia. Packers coach Mike McCarthy offered no injury update on any of the team's players at his press conference today, including wide receiver Randall Cobb, who was watching practice this afternoon. Packers linebacker Adrian Hubbard also tweeted  that he has been released by the Packers today.",364882f4-1794-48d6-b1da-f9746fddc272,News,2015-09-01T21:43:34Z,WTAQ News Talk,Abbrederis returns to practice for Packers but is it too late?,0.0,News

5650,"NEW DELHI, Sept 16: 
Congress and its alliance partners have decided to approach the Election Commission to seek a ban on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Mann ki baat’ radio programme, alleging it violates the model code of conduct in force for Bihar polls, but the poll panel said no “blanket ban” on it can be imposed. 
“We take strong objection to the misuse of the public broadcaster for political purposes by the Prime Minister, who is the chief campaigner and face of the BJP,” Congress’ senior spokesman Anand Sharma told journalists. 
Sharma said his party and its alliance partners will approach EC as the Prime Minister is “thick skinned” and determined to “misuse” his office and the public broadcaster. 
The Prime Minister should have “shown grace” and avoided the radio programme in the run up to the Bihar elections, he said. 
The Commission, however, said no “blanket ban” can be imposed on the programme and that it can take “cognizance” of any such demand only after finding that the programme’s contents violate the model code. 
“No blanket ban can be enforced on things like Cabinet meeting and Mann ki baat but the EC can take cognizance if the Cabinet decision or the content of programme is in violation of the Model Code of Conduct,” a senior EC official said. 
If such a complaint is made, the election watchdog goes through the recording and transcript of the episode and takes a decision, he said. 
A similar complaint was made by Congress against the programme during the Haryana assembly polls but the EC had not found anything “objectionable”, he noted. 
A regular radio broadcast in which Modi shares his thoughts on issues, Mann ki baat’s next episode will be aired on Sunday. (PTI)

4481,"Cases of HIV, hepatitis C and other sexually transmitted infections are increasing in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Cases of HIV, hepatitis C and other sexually transmitted infections are increasing in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, despite declining or stabilising in the broader population, a new report has found.

The Kirby Institute's annual surveillance report showed the rate of HIV diagnosis among Indigenous people had climbed to 5.9 per 100,000, compared to 3.7 for non-Indigenous Australians. Ten years ago there was little difference.

Likewise, the rate of hepatitis C has increased in Indigenous communities despite falling over the past 10 years in the general population. There were 300 more diagnoses among Aboriginal and Torres Trait Islanders in 2014 than 2005, but 1300 fewer among non-Indigenous people.

Indigenous health researcher James Ward, an adviser to the Kirby Institute, said the trends were concerning and required immediate action. Aboriginal people were between three and 50 times as likely to be diagnosed with an STI, he said.

""That's not because they're any more promiscuous, it's about a high burden of disease that primary healthcare hasn't been able to bring under control,"" he said.

Associate Professor Ward said the link between injecting drug use and infections was ""really worrying"", and Australia risked the same fate as Canada, where First Nations people accounted for 20 per cent of HIV diagnoses each year, despite being only four per cent of the population.

Fears that needle use would spread HIV in Aboriginal communities were voiced at the annual Australasian HIV/AIDS Conference five years ago. Higher rates of STIs also made HIV easier to transmit, Associate Professor Ward said.

But other health experts suggested the higher rates of infection reflected the fact that more Indigenous people were seeing doctors.

""There's a greater likelihood that people will be tested, so of course the numbers will jump, but it's a false jump,"" said Aunty Kerrie Doyle, Associate Professor of Indigenous health at RMIT.

Research director at the Poche Centre for Indigenous Health, Jon Willis, said the number of HIV diagnoses in Indigenous communities was still low (33 in 2014), meaning that small increases could appear more significant than they should. ""It's not cause for a panic,"" he said.

The Kirby Institute report also showed that substantially more people were being tested for HIV nationwide. Between 2011 and 2014, the number of tests among gay and bisexual men attending sexual health clinics doubled to 26,000.

""There has been an increased effort to make testing more attractive for people,"" said the report's author, Rebecca Guy. Rapid testing now takes as little as 20 minutes, and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is available for people who think they may have contracted HIV.

Overall, the report found HIV diagnoses had levelled off over the past three years, although the 1081 new cases recorded in 2014 was still higher than the record low of 714 in 1999. The main route of transmission was sex between men, which accounted for 70 per cent of cases.

Syphilis and gonorrhoea remained conditions that were mostly associated with heterosexual Aboriginal people and homosexual men in urban areas, the report found.

Experts blamed cuts to communicable disease services in Queensland under the former Newman government for the failure to contain a syphilis outbreak that began around the same time.

Associate Professor Ward said there were now 500 cases of infectious syphilis in regional and remote northern Australia and a handful of babies born with congenital syphilis.

""That is totally unacceptable in the Australian community,"" he said. Attempts to combat the infection were having marginal success but ""the outbreak is exceeding the efforts"", he said. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.",5419ffff-ba03-4681-aa2d-baef8d9fe261,News,2015-09-15T06:08:22Z,Northwest Tasmania Advocate,"HIV, hep C and STI cases increase in Indigenous communities, remain stable in the broader population",0.0,Blog

5478,"Salesforce has been on a crazy growth trajectory over the past few years. It's been repeatedly beating sales projections, and its stock continues to reach record-high levels. 

In fact, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff likes to claim that Salesforce is the fastest growing enterprise software company ever, even promising to get to $10 billion in sales faster than any of his competitors. 

One chart that illustrates Salesforce's meteoric rise can be found in the slide deck it shared during Tuesday's annual Investor Day. 

It shows Salesforce overtaking two of the largest legacy vendors, Oracle and SAP, in the customer relationship management (CRM) software industry in just the past two years. While Oracle and SAP continue to decline in market share, Salesforce now owns over 18% of the market, almost double what it had 5 years ago:

4755,"Last week, I posted about our new photovoltaic (PV) array simulators, models N8737APV and N8757APV. These power supplies can produce an I-V curve as their output characteristic and provide up to 15 kW, 1500 V, and 30 A. Today, I am posting about yet another new series of Keysight power products (wow, our R&D team has been busy!). This new family is at the opposite end of the power spectrum compared to the 15 kW PV array simulators. The new family consists of five models in the 30 to 40 W range with voltages up to 100 V and currents up to 5 A all providing a standard rectangular output characteristic. Click here for the press release that just went out yesterday!
I really like this new family of power supplies and I think you will too!
Why?
Because….
You can choose from a variety of voltage and current combinations to meet your needs.
You can save space on your bench with these very compact models that are only 2U high and ¼-rack-width wide.
You can set and read back very accurate voltage and current values with a basic accuracy of 0.05%.
You can view the high visibility OLED display from nearly any angle.
You can regulate your set voltage at your load to make up for voltage drop in your load leads with remote sense terminals and leads.
You can communicate with these power supplies with either LAN or USB since both interfaces are included.
You can protect your device under test with the built in overvoltage protection and overcurrent protection.
And you can easily access all of the other beneficial features in this tiny package with the on-screen menu system.
So you can see that there is a lot you can do with these compact power packages!
Here is a listing of the models:
Below is a picture of the family showing each of the five new models. So the next time you have to equip your bench with DC power that goes beyond a basic power supply, consider the new E36100 Series Programmable DC Power Supplies from Keysight Technologies. I know I would (but then again…..look where I work…..)!",d05b15e8-1099-487e-9bea-99dfa8f6d9ba,Blog,2015-09-03T02:01:41Z,Watt's Up?,"Yet another new Keysight power product family - this time, compact bench-top DC power!",1.0,News
1731,"The versatility of Johnny Depp never fails to amaze me. 
 
  
 
Jack Sparrow. Donnie Brasco. Willy Wonka (after Gene Wilder perfected the role). 
 
  
 
That was Depp.

Yep. Depp.

Depp needed a meaty role in a critically acclaimed movie in the worst way, and he got both with “Black Mass,” in theaters this weekend nationwide, at Tinseltown in Summit Township, and The Movies at Meadville. 
 
  
 

 
  
 
Depp is getting arguably the finest reviews of his career for his tour de force performance as real-life gangster James “Whitey” Bulger, who turned South Boston in the 1970s into his personal killing fields. 
 
  
 
Depp, now 52, has knocked on Oscar’s door three times, with best actor nominations for “Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,” “Finding Neverland,” and “Sweeney Todd.” 
 
  
 
Playing the infamous Bulger, and playing it well, is the perfect character grist for Depp to finally walk away with his first Academy Award.

3835,"Yesterday I talked about how data collection, management, and maintenance play a crucial role in deliverability .  I mentioned, briefly, the idea that bad data can accumulate on a list that isn’t well managed. Today I’d like to dig into that a little more and talk about the non-permanence of email addresses. 
 
A common statistic used to describe list churn is that 30% of addresses become invalid in a year.  This was research done by Return Path back in the early 2000’s. The actual research report is hard to find, but I found a couple articles and press releases discussing the info. 
 
A new study, to be unveiled next week at The 85th Annual Direct Marketing Association conference, indicates that email addresses are changing at the rate of 31% annually, driven by ISP switching, job changes and consumer efforts to avoid SPAM. 
 
The email survey, conducted by independent, third-party research firm NFO WorldGroup, concluded that, consequently, the majority of consumers lose touch with personal and professional contacts and with preferred websites. […] 
The survey, conducted in August 2002, updates a similar study by Return Path and NFO WorldGroup from September 2000, which identified a 32% annual rate of email address churn. The results are based on responses from 1,015 consumers from NFO WorldGroup’s online panel of U.S. email users over the age of 18. The panel is representative of U.S. online households.   ISP Switching and SPAM Continue to Drive Email Address Changes 
 
While I think the address change rates are probably lower now, list churn still exists. 
 
In 2002, NFO reported users changed personal email addresses for a number of reasons. 
  50% changed due to an ISP switch  16% changed due to spam  12% changed due to a move  8% changed due to a “more attractive” email address.   
Work users also changed addresses, and for many of the same reasons. 
  41% changed due to new jobs  18% changed due to an ISP change  8% changed due to a residential move  6% change due to a name change (divorce or marriage)   
Given the changes in free webmail providers since 2002, I expect address changes due to ISP switching or moving is less common than it was. But other reasons that users cited still exist, including spam levels, new jobs and name changes. 
 
Of course, my gut feeling that these numbers are old and out of date and probably no longer accurate was crushed last week. The LA Times published an article about Hillary Rodham Clinton’s email campaigns. After her run for president in 2007, her email address database had approximately 2.5 million records. According to the article, less than 100,000 of the addresses are still valid. That’s more than 30% attrition every year. 
 
List churn is real. While we may not know what the exact percentage of churn is, we know it happens. I expect that list churn, like most things in deliverability, is related to the actual recipient group. Some lists, like Secretary Clinton’s list, may have a very high churn rate. Other lists focused on different demographics might have a much lower churn rate. 
 
While the LA Times article mentioned these addresses bounced (“an inbox clogged with bounce-back messages”) not all churn is so visible. There’s also “stealth” churn, where addresses are abandoned by their users but still accept mail. 
 
What can you do? Mostly I recommend first wrapping your head around the idea that churn exists. Once you really believe churn is real then you can address how to fix it in your specific environment. 
 
Key things to remember when planning a data management plan: 
  Email addresses are not permanent.  Subscriber data degrades if you don’t actively manage it.  Deliverability depends on data quality.  Maintaining data is easier than trying to clean data.  Using list cleaning services will remove hard bounces, but won’t address “stealth” churn, which can still affect deliverability.   
If there’s anything my work with clients has taught me is that the more creative and flexible you can be in regards to list management, the more effective your overall email marketing program can be.

1180,"Beijing,China - County Executive Rushern L. Baker, III is leading a 22 member delegation of business and government officials to China looking toward investment opportunities and partnerships with Chinese business owners and investors. While we were resting up for Labor Day on Sunday, the Prince George's County delegation began its first full day on the mission with a quick stop at the Great Wall of China then gathered to tour the Zhongguancun China Science Park (Z-Park) in Beijing. Z-Park is China's premier science and technology development center and was the first state-level high-tech development zone approved by the State Council in 1988. This Beijing icon is very well known in China and is often referred to as China's ""Silicon Valley"" because of its connections to information technology and its strategic cooperation with other science parks.

With a stack of bilingual business cards in their pockets, the delegates were treated to lunch at Z-Park by the Rechsand Science and Technology Group, and met with 40 tech companies that were eager to do business with members of the delegation. After lunch, EDC President Jim Coleman presented to the Z-Park companies the value of doing business in Prince George's County, why Prince George's County is the ""Gateway to the U.S. Market"", and the mission delegates' investment and partnership opportunities. Mr. Coleman also officially announced the opening of the China Business Center in the Prince George's County Economic Development Corporation. The China Business Center offers Chinese-based companies a successful 'launching pad' to enter the United States business market. With services ranging from office space to recruitment of local staff, the China Business Center is a turnkey solution for any Chinese based company seeking to grow sales by selling innovative products to U.S. based companies and government agencies.

""I am delighted by the response we have been getting from China's business and government leaders,"" said EDC President and CEO Jim Coleman. ""With the investment opportunities that our delegation is presenting this year, we are hoping to duplicate the Rechsand partnership model and confident that these projects will be coming to fruition very soon."" 

The Rechsand Science and Technology Group is a company that the Baker Administration touts as one of its successes from the 2014 China Mission. Through the partnerships that were created on that mission, the County facilitated an alliance between Rechsand and Corvias Solutions - the company that won a $2 billion contract with the County for storm-water management project. This alliance has generated a partnership/presence with Prince George's County and helped create the ""Sponge City"" initiative where Rechsand's technology (based on a model from Prince George's County) will be used in 16 cities around China to improve water quality.

6265,"Vatican hopes pope's Cuba trip helps end US embargoHoly See states desire for end to US embargo and improved human rights on the islandFri, Sep 18, 2015, 06:34The Vatican said on Thursday it hoped Pope Francis's trip to Cuba would help bring an end to a 53-year-old US embargo and lead to more freedom and human rights on the communist island.The pope will spend four days in Cuba before flying to the United States. He is visiting both countries for the first time as pontiff, after Vatican mediation that led to a restoration of ties between Washington and Havana last year.In an interview with Vatican Television, the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, said the Holy See had always opposed the trade and economic embargo against Cuba because it hurt ordinary people most.""It is hoped ... that a measure like this (ending the embargo) will also bring with it a greater openness from the point of view of freedom and human rights,"" Parolin said.He said the Vatican hoped for ""a flowering of these fundamental aspects for the life of persons and peoples"".Last month, US secretary of state John Kerry said the US Congress was unlikely to ever lift a punishing economic embargo on Cuba unless the Communist government improved its human rights record. Cuba fiercely rejects such conditions.Before resuming relations, the two countries were locked for decades in hostilities that outlived the Cold War.The comments by cardinal Parolin, known as the ""deputy pope"" because he is second only to pope Francis in the Vatican hierarchy, appeared to be hints that the pope would speak about the embargo as well as about human rights while in Cuba.Amnesty International said he was visiting Cuba while the island was at ""a human rights crossroads"".""Over the past few months, we have seen unprecedented openness when it comes to Cuba's international relations,"" said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at the rights group.""However, the country still needs to make progress when it comes to allowing people to peacefully express their views without fear of being harassed, detained or attacked.""Cuba's Communist government has said it has no political prisoners, and that opponents mistakenly consider armed counter-revolutionaries and common criminals as political cases.In a video message to Cubans ahead of his visit, pope Francis asked for prayers and said he was coming as a ""missionary of God's mercy and tenderness"".In the message shown mid-evening on state TV, Francis also offered a simple message: ""Jesus loves you very much, he really loves you, he carries you in his heart.""ReutersSource: Vatican hopes pope's Cuba trip helps end US embargo - http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/vatican-hopes-pope-s-cuba-trip-helps-end-us-embargo-1.2356548",8d17c366-0f1f-4bb4-8908-fafa88d7876b,Blog,2015-09-18T13:21:45Z,Cuba Solidarity,Vatican hopes pope’s Cuba trip helps end US embargo,1.0,Blog
2651,"682- Today's Prime Time Devo comes from 2Sa 22:37 You enlarged my path under me; So my feet did not slip. I don't know about you, but when I drive in the mountains on roads without guardrails, I freak out. I get queasy just looking at video of some of the crazy trails that people have carved out of mountains. If there is height involved, I want a very wide trail with very high railings. David points out here that we don't need to live our lives precariously. God is more than willing and able to widen the road beneath our feet and give us sure footing. He does this with His Word. John the Baptist came preaching the Word of repentance. He established the grade and Jesus came and paved the way to heaven with the Gospel. Mr 1:2 As it is written in the Prophets: ""Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, Who will prepare Your way before You."" 3 ""The voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the LORD; Make His paths straight.'"" 4 John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. This preaching of the Word opened the way of salvation through faith in the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world! Here's the thing about God's Word. It not only leads to salvation but it is an ever-widening road of wisdom and understanding as we prayerfully read and study it with the help of the Holy Spirit. This Word will give us sure footing as we travel the road of life. As it says in Pr 4:10-15, “ Hear, my son, and receive my sayings, And the years of your life will be many. 11 I have taught you in the way of wisdom; I have led you in right paths. 12 When you walk, your steps will not be hindered, And when you run, you will not stumble. 13 Take firm hold of instruction, do not let go; Keep her, for she is your life. 14 Do not enter the path of the wicked, And do not walk in the way of evil. 15 Avoid it, do not travel on it; Turn away from it and pass on. Pilgrim, take the road God has laid out for you in His Word.",1674731b-bc60-4eca-a862-bdda273ca465,Blog,2015-09-18T11:13:43Z,Prime Time Devo,The Ever-Widening Road,1.0,News

55,"The Asus MG279Q is one of two models in this roundup - the other is the Acer XB270HU - to use in-plane switching (IPS) technology. The other monitors use twisted nematic (TN) panels, which have inferior viewing angles.

Hence, if viewing angles are your biggest concern, you should be looking at these two models.

The Acer and the Asus differ mainly in the variable refresh rate technology used. Asus supports AMD FreeSync, while Acer uses Nvidia's G-Sync technology. The variable refresh rate range on the Asus is between 35Hz and 90Hz. This is not as wide as the Acer (30Hz to 144Hz) and the BenQ XL2730Z (40Hz to 144Hz). However, it is probably adequate as most games should be running at frame rates within this range. If your games fall outside this range, you can probably tweak their graphics settings to bring them back within the range to benefit from FreeSync.

Physically, the monitor is fairly slim, with a 13mm-wide bezel.

Overall, my impression is that the monitor is not overly loud and should appeal to non-gamers too.

You can pivot the Asus 90 degrees for a portrait orientation or swivel it by up to 60 degrees to its sides. It has a pair of built-in speakers and two USB 3.0 ports at the bottom rear of the display.

Navigate the on-screen display (OSD) settings with a joystick. The monitor includes six predefined settings, or profiles, that are optimised for different usage modes, from watching movies to playing a first-person shooter game.

A demo feature helps you decide whether the selected profile is suitable. It splits the screen into two, with one half showing the original display setting and the other the chosen profile, so that you can see both side by side. A crosshair overlay can be turned on to help gamers aim in shooting games.

Screen brightness topped out at 270 nits, making it one of the brightest models I have tested. However, colour accuracy was average with a score of 3 out of 5 compared to 4.5 for the Acer. Several handy features for gamers

Gamers will like this BenQ XL2730Z monitor. Not only does it support AMD FreeSync for a smooth gaming experience (with a compatible AMD graphics card), but also it has a number of features that cater to gamers.

For example, you can hang your headset on a retractable hook at the left of the display. A carry handle makes it easier to take the monitor to LAN gaming parties.

You can plug your headset into the monitor, as it has headphone and microphone jacks. On-screen display (OSD) settings let gamers adjust the headset volume or mute the headset microphone.

The BenQ's screen can pivot 90 degrees to a portrait orientation. It lets you swivel 45 degrees to the sides - more limited than other monitors I've tried. The monitor comes with a unique feature that I find useful. The OSD settings can be adjusted using an external controller dubbed the S Switch. The wired round puck, which comes with large buttons and a scroll wheel, fits neatly into a circular indent at the base of the monitor stand.

I find the S Switch easier to use than traditional OSD buttons on other monitors. You can also save up to three different sets of display settings, and switch quickly between them using the S Switch.

Gaming-centric features include a Black Equalizer mode, which attempts to brighten dark areas of the screen so that you can spot concealed enemies more easily during a game. There is also a motion-blur reduction feature that helps reduce the amount of smearing during fast action games.

But both features have their downsides. The Black Equalizer mode makes everything look overexposed and affects colour accuracy. Turning on blur reduction leads to a reduction in screen brightness. So use them with discretion.

The AMD FreeSync feature on this BenQ monitor works for refresh rates from 40Hz to 144Hz - the widest range among the three AMD FreeSync monitors in this round-up. Its closest rival is the Asus MG279Q, which has a FreeSync range of 35Hz to 90Hz.

The viewing angle is decent, but not as wide as on monitors that use in-plane switching display technology. Nevertheless, the BenQ's twisted nematic screen has good colour accuracy - as long as you do not use its Black Equalizer mode. Lower screen resolution is a letdown

The biggest flaw in this Philips monitor is its 1,920 x 1,080-pixel screen resolution. While this resolution is adequate for a 24-inch monitor, it is not good enough for a 27-inch display. In comparison, the other monitors in this roundup have screen resolutions of at least 2,560 x 1,440 pixels.

To be fair, the lower screen resolution may be useful for gamers with less powerful computers. They can run games smoothly at the native resolution without having to reduce their graphics settings. On the other hand, the Philips monitor does not look as sharp as its rivals when it comes to browsing the Internet or reading a document.

Viewing from the sides and the bottom is poor, though not unexpected, given that this monitor uses a twisted nematic (TN) panel instead of in-plane switching (IPS) technology. There is one upside though: TN screens usually have low response time and input lag. As a result, games, especially first-person shooters, feel responsive.

Philips has tried to inject a bit of flair into the design. The display has a red strip in front and its stand has an opening for cables to pass through. You can rotate the screen by 90 degrees to portrait orientation, and swivel the display to the right or left by 65 degrees.

However, the bezel looks chunky at around 25mm at the top and 20mm at the sides. A laptop-style external power brick is required. Like most Nvidia G-Sync monitors, the Philips monitor has a single DisplayPort connector. There are no HDMI or DVI inputs. But there is an integrated USB hub with four USB 3.0 ports at the back.

Touch-sensitive buttons operate the on-screen display settings. The settings are fairly basic with no profiles for specific tasks.

There is an option to display a crosshair on the screen to help players in first-person shooter games. But this lone gamer feature feels like a token gesture.

In my test with a colourimeter, the Philips covered 99 per cent of the sRGB colour space. Colour accuracy was decent, but not as good as some of its competitors.

At $999, the Philips is one of the least expensive Nvidia G-Sync monitors in the market, though AMD FreeSync models are around the same price.

However, the IPS-based Acer XB270HU arguably provides better value despite being more expensive at $1,099. Friendly price tag but there's a catch

Of the five monitors in this round-up, Samsung U28E590DS is the only model with an ultra high-definition (also known as 4K) resolution. Its rivals have a screen resolution of 2,560 x 1,440 pixels or fewer.

Yet, it is one of the more affordable monitors at $899. Only the BenQ XL2730Z is cheaper ($888).

But there is a catch. The Samsung monitor uses a twisted nematic (TN) panel with viewing angles that are not as wide as other displays based on in-plane switching (IPS) technology. The bottom viewing angle is especially bad, with significant colour shift.

Samsung has tried to remedy this inherent weakness in TN displays with an image enhancement feature dubbed Samsung Magic Angle. This feature offers five different profiles, each designed to alleviate the poor viewing angles of the display for specific scenarios. For instance, Group View is intended for multiple viewers while Lean Back tries to improve the viewing experience when looking at the display from below.

In practice, Magic Angle works pretty well - so much so that I could almost forget that this is a monitor with a TN display.

The Samsung scored well in our colour accuracy test. I also like that it comes with a joystick for users to adjust the on-screen display settings. It is easier to use than the usual buttons.

However, you will need a high-end gaming system to get the most out of this monitor. Unlike its rivals, the Samsung has a very limited FreeSync range (40 to 60Hz). This means that unless your game is running between 40 and 60 frames per second, it will not benefit from FreeSync. To achieve such consistent frame rates in the latest games at 3,840 x 2,160 pixels requires a powerful computer, such as one with dual graphics cards.

It is not a deal-breaker if you have a high-end system, but keep this in mind if you are buying the monitor solely for the FreeSync feature. Other flaws that may put you off: The monitor lacks pivot and swivel functionality and it also has no USB ports.",eb497d2c-aa44-48bc-a1b5-e691b773b469,News,2015-09-15T21:00:00Z,Straits Times,IPS gaming monitor has great viewing angles,0.0,News
6826,"MIAMI (AP)  Florida Lt. Gov. Carlos López-Cantera said Wednesday he is running for the US Senate seat being vacated by his close friend Marco Rubio, who is running for president. 
 
The 41-year-old Republican announced his entry in a YouTube video — in English and Spanish — that featured his wife and two daughters, along with photos of his Cuban parents. 
 
As a family, weve decided Im running for the US Senate, so that your kids and mine can continue to live in the kind of country that gave my family the blessings of liberty and freedom that only America offers, López-Cantera says on the two-minute video. 
 
 
I still believe in the America that Washington has forgotten, says López-Cantera, who is of Cuban and Jewish descent and was born in Spain. 
 
López-Cantera will face Republican Congressman Ron DeSantis in the primary. Rep. David Jolly is expected to announce next week that he is running. 
 
Democratic Congressmen Patrick Murphy and Alan Grayson are also seeking the seat. 
 
The race is expected to draw national attention because it gives Democrats a chance to pick up a seat in the Republican-controlled Senate. 
 
The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said in a statement that López-Cantera is a career politician who stands with special interests instead of Florida families. 
 
López-Cantera embraced his ties to Gov. Rick Scott in the YouTube video, saying they turned around the state economy by creating 900,000 jobs, reducing debt and cutting taxes. 
 
Conservative principles work, says López-Cantera, adding he will take the same ideas to Washington to control government spending and government power. 
 
Scott picked López-Cantera as lieutenant governor in early 2014 after leaving the post vacant for nearly a year following the forced resignation of Jennifer Carroll. He had left the Florida Legislature due to term limits and had won election as property appraiser for Miami-Dade County. 
 
During the 2014 legislative session, López-Cantera helped shape Scotts agenda in a crucial election year. But his role diminished after Scott won re-election and shook up his executive staff. 
 
López-Cantera was not actively involved in a bitter standoff over Medicaid expansion that forced legislators into a special session, leading to criticism of his work ethic from Democrats. 
 
López-Cantera told The Associated Press that he still has a great relationship with Scott and that he is a great admirer of what hes done as governor. But he has already acknowledged he does not expect Scott to endorse him in the GOP primary. 
 
Speaking in English and Spanish to supporters at a rally Wednesday afternoon, López-Cantera pledged to follow Rubios lead to fight for Florida in Washington. He also said he would continue to push for democracy in Cuba and Venezuela, and to protect Israel. 
 
The crowd chanted Carlos, Carlos, Carlos, with some holding handmade signs that read Viva, Carlos and Conservatives for Carlos. 
 
Hes an honest man, said 60-year-old James Williams, 60, of Miami, a longtime friend of López-Cantera who attended the rally. You dont get that anymore in Washington. 
 
López-Cantera spoke in the warehouse of All American Containers, a Miami company whose owner and employees have contributed tens of thousands of dollars to mostly Republican candidates. In the 1990s, the owners were accused of tax evasion. Remedios Díaz-Oliver was sentenced to three years of probation, while his wife pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors. 
 
Remedios Díaz-Oliver, who owns the packaging company with her husband, Fausto, said, our families have a similar bond, noting López-Canteras family also fled Cuba.

4465,"OTTAWA — Elizabeth May repeatedly needled Conservative Leader Stephen Harper early in the French-language debate as she touted the Green party's vision for a more co-operative federation. 
 

                            May dismissed concern over face coverings at citizenship ceremonies as a ""false debate,"" stressed revitalizing the economy with municipal infrastructure spending and denounced the concentration of power in the Prime Minister's Office.   
 

                            The Green leader chided Harper for not working with his provincial counterparts and she had the prime minister shaking his head as she attacked the federal record on environmental stewardship. 
 

                            The debate might have been in French, but May clearly saw the exchange in Montreal as a chance to reach a broad sweep of Canadians with the Green message. 
 

                            The evening was especially important to the party since it could be May's last opportunity to stand alongside the other leaders before the Oct. 19 election. 
 

                            May took part in a debate sponsored by Maclean's magazine early last month. But she was excluded from the recent Globe and Mail debate on the economy — though she did light up Twitter with video retorts — and she isn't invited to one sponsored by the Munk Debates on foreign policy. 
 

                            In addition, it looks like the sort of widely broadcast English debate seen in previous campaigns may not happen this time since Harper has refused to take part and NDP Leader Tom Mulcair has said he won't participate if Harper doesn't. 
 

                            The Greens held just two seats in the last Parliament — neither in Quebec. But May is enthusiastic about her candidates in the province, including environmental scientist Daniel Green in Montreal and long-time eco-activist Andre Belisle in the riding held by Conservative cabinet minister Steven Blaney.   
 

                            As the debate unfolded, May made good on her promise to go after Harper, leaving the other leaders relatively unscathed. 
 

                            She believes her presence in the 2008 televised English debate was a factor in holding Harper's Conservatives to a minority. She wasn't invited to the 2011 exchange. 
 

                            ""The real dynamic is that when Greens are in the debates, Conservatives don't do as well,"" she said this week in an interview.

826,"Q: Our first, a girl, just turned three and has suddenly started throwing tantrums. She can begin a tantrum when she's alone in her room if something she's playing with doesn't do what she wants it to do. It's as if she is right on the edge of a tantrum all day long. We've started walking on eggshells around her as a result, and we realize we're giving in a lot just to keep the peace. We don't understand how such a happy baby and toddler has become such a malcontent. Nothing has changed in our family situation that might explain it. Can you? 

A: You're doing what all too many of today's parents tend to do: Instead of trying to solve a behavior problem, you're trying to figure out what has caused it. It's what I call ""thinking psychologically."" And because none of your theories concerning your daughter's tantrums can be either proven or disproven, you're becoming increasingly confused. The inevitable end result of this is a state I refer to as ""disciplinary paralysis."" As you confess, you don't know what to do, you're walking on eggshells, giving in to keep the peace. 

You're obviously an intelligent person. I shouldn't need to tell you that every time you shut down a tantrum by giving in, you make the problem that much worse. Short-term ""solutions"" make for long-term nightmares. 

Some children begin throwing tantrums when they're 12 months old; some don't start until they're three; but almost all children go through a phase during which they throw lots of tantrums. Why? Because they believe that what they want, they deserve to have. The ""hump"" of parenting is that of patiently, lovingly, but very firmly and steadfastly teaching a child that reality is not going to cooperate with that narcissistic fantasy. Parents who fail to get over that hump are in for a long haul down a hard road. And a child whose parents fail to get over that hump is in for a very rude awakening if not a very unhappy life. 

The very simple solution to your daughter's fits is known as the ""tantrum place."" First field-tested on my daughter Amy when she began throwing fits of pique at age three, it has since provided much-appreciated relief to many a parent. 

Tell your daughter that her temper tantrums are very special things and need a very special place. With Amy, we used a half-bathroom, but any relatively isolated place will do, even a rug. 

Say, ""The new rule is that when you begin having a tantrum, you have to go to your new tantrum place. If you need help getting there, we will help you. You can scream as long and as loud as you want, but you can't come out until you stop."" 

At first, she is probably going to come out of her tantrum place before her fit has completely run its course. In that event, just calmly put her back, reminding her of the new rule. 

The important thing is that you act resolutely so as to send the clear message that her outbursts are not going to determine how the world works. If you are purposeful, you should have a much calmer household in no time.

4993,"First worn by her great-great-grandmother, then by a further NINE relatives, the Victorian dress needed rescuing, and Abby is determined to preserve it for the future It's a decision no bride-to-be takes lightly. 

When choosing a wedding dress , nothing other than 'the one' will do, something which will flatter you, make you feel beautiful and stand the test of time. 

There's also the age-old tradition of ""something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue"" to take into account.

With this in mind, Pennsylvania bride Abby Kingston has found a unique and poignant way of combining tradition and looking her best - and it's been a labour of love.

As reported in the NY Daily News , on 17 October, Abby will become the eleventh woman in her family to walk down in the aisle in a 120 year-old heirloom wedding dress first worn by her great-great-grandmother in 1895 . 

What made your wedding day special? Email YourMirror@mirror.co.uk or fill in the form at the bottom. Barcroft Abby and her mother Leslie, who also wore the special dress on her wedding day Since then, the Victorian two-piece ensemble (made up of a bodice and skirt) has been worn by her mother and eight other female relatives.

Once she got engaged, Abby knew she wanted to continue the lovely custom, and the dress was located in the care of her great aunt Sarah ""Sally"" Seiler Ogden.

However, the years had taken their toll on the antique garment - and some drastic alterations needed to be made. Barcroft Leslie goes through the photos documenting the dress' outings Describing the first time she saw the the dress to the NY Daily News, Abby said: ""It was a dingy brown and had all this lace appliqué all over it to cover damage from wear and tear over years.

""I put on the top, and it was almost a crop top on me. And the skirt had been cut short.""

It seemed as if there was nothing that could be done to save the dress, until Abby was introduced to bridal dress designer Deborah LoPresti. Barcroft The antique gown is made of silk-satin and required highly-specialised care It was a departure from the usual restoration she did, but working with a well-practised dry cleaner, Deborah was able to bring the dress back to life.

  MARSHFIELD – Dinah Shore’s commercial jingle “See the U.S.A. in Your Chevrolet” poured through the speakers at the 35th annual Spindles Car Show. Thousands traveled to the Marshfield Fairgrounds on Sunday to see more than 700 old, restored, and custom cars and trucks. “There’s something for everyone,” Spindles Auto Club member, Chris Perrotta said. Thunderbirds, Mustangs, Camaros, and recently “tricked-out” cars lined up to be viewed and judged. Peter Anderson was just there to look, but is considering purchasing an older car. “I really like the look of that SS Chevelle,” Anderson said pointing to a shiny orange 1970’s Chevrolet. Many were there to admire the vintage vehicles, purchase cars for sale or parts at the swap-meet, but some were there for another reason entirely. Marshfield artist Ted Polomis attended the car show to get inspiration for his new paintings. Every angle of a metallic Tiffany-blue Corvette was photographed for Polomis’ newest endeavor. Last year’s show attracted more than 6,000 spectators, Spindles Auto Club member, Chris Perrotta said. “Usually people get into this because of their families,” Perrotta said about restoring cars. Nostalgia is the reason he got involved restoring old Ford station-wagons, which is what his father drove. The majority of the proceeds from the show’s entry fee and prize giveaways will go towards Dana-Farber Cancer Institute’s Jimmy Fund and Weymouth High School scholarship fund. Trophies were presented to the best-in-show vehicles and D.A.R.E. officers presented a trophy to the car voted “most likely to get pulled over.”",a35bb657-8854-4639-9cb1-7634f3d10185,News,2015-09-06T22:36:43Z,Wicked Local Marshfield,Car show attracts thousands to Marshfield,0.0,News

6038,"Fortumo The payment service provider 1Pay and the mobile payments company Fortumo are today announcing a partnership for direct carrier billing in South-East Asia. 

Merchants using 1Pay are now able to collect payments from their users in Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia by charging payments to the users’ phone bills.

Mr. Luyen Ngoc Huy, CEO of 1Pay says “1Pay is now expanding its market to South-East Asia with the first move to open office in Indonesia. We certainly look for compatible partners that help us to set up and run business in the shortest time. We chose Fortumo because they have a very flexible system that allows 1Pay to connect and operate quickly. Furthermore, Fortumo is a world-class reputable company. Hopefully, this cooperation brings a good business prospect for both companies in these markets.”

""Integrating mobile operators one-by-one is a difficult process for payment service providers. Each carrier has their own technical setup and negotiations take a long time. We are excited to accelerate the adoption of carrier billing by 1Pay by giving them access to direct carrier billing in several markets through just one integration. For merchants using 1Pay, direct carrier billing gives a significant increase in paying user coverage in markets with extremely low credit card penetration,"" said Sanjay Sinha, head of Fortumo India.

1Pay is an open platform for e-payments, working as an intermediary payment gateway. 1Pay mainly focuses on optimizing payment effectiveness, fast speed, high stability, a smart analysis system, multidimensional report, supporting all integration methods and automating the whole process of integration.

Fortumo direct carrier billing is available to more than 350 million mobile phone owners in Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia. Meanwhile, less than 10 million people in these countries have access to credit cards which means that a majority of smartphone owners are unable to pay for online content through traditional payment methods. In Asia, Fortumo’s direct carrier billing platform is available more than 2.5 billion end-users in 14 countries. Recently, Fortumo announced a partnership with the mobile operator dtac in Thailand. Fortumo’s direct carrier billing platform allows more than 4 billion end-users to pay merchants using their phone bill in 90 countries across the world. Since the mobile operator has all the information necessary to process the payment, this removes the need to send any text messages during the payment process. In markets where Fortumo provides direct carrier billing, payment conversion for first-time payments is close to 40% and higher for repeat purchases.

13,"Former St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Joaquin Andujar died Tuesday in the Dominican Republic at age 62 after an extended battle with diabetes. 
 
Andujar was to be honored in his hometown of San Pedro de Macoris on Tuesday and buried Wednesday. 

The right-hander finished his major league career with a 127-118 record and a 3.58 ERA with the Cardinals, Houston Astros and Oakland Athletics. He was named to the All-Star team four times in 13 seasons and helped the Cardinals win the 1982 World Series, posting a 2-0 record against the Milwaukee Brewers in the Fall Classic, including a victory in Game 7. 

In 1984 and 1985, Andujar won 20 and 21 games and finished fourth in the National League Cy Young Award voting both years. He was considered one of baseball's top pitchers in the 1980s. 

""Joaquin struggled for years with diabetes and in recent days had deteriorated a lot,"" former major league pitcher and fellow Dominican Mario Soto said, according to ESPN. ""He was hospitalized several times but always came out unscathed. However, he surrendered to the disease that consumed him completely."" 

The Cardinals paid tribute to Andujar on Twitter, saying ""He was 'One Tough Dominican' & a member of our Cardinals family. We loved him & we will miss him. RIP Joaquin Andujar"" 

Andujar also played for 14 years in the Dominican winter league. 

""We extend our deepest condolences to the relatives of Mr. Andujar, a fierce pitcher who always gave the maximum on the mound,"" said Leonardo Matos Berrido, president of the Dominican winter baseball league.",9c957b52-513a-4b74-9f40-dd2db587153a,News,2015-09-08T18:03:05Z,News Channel 21,Former pitcher Andujar dies at 62,0.0,Blog
527,"A poker player attacked and murdered the close friend of his former girlfriend's suspected lover, a court has heard. A poker player attacked and murdered the close friend of his former girlfriend's suspected lover, a court has heard. Crown prosecutor Tom Gyorffy, QC, told a Supreme Court jury on Wednesday that Collin Thomas became angry when George Anagnostellis refused to tell him where he could find his love rival.

Mr Gyorffy said Mr Thomas attacked Mr Anagnostellis, who was separated from his wife and living at his parents' home in Malvern East, before setting fire to the garage on April 11, 2014.

Mr Thomas has pleaded not guilty to one count of murder and one count of arson.

Mr Gyorffy said that at the time of his death, Mr Anagnostellis was an avid poker player who played and organised poker tournaments at local hotels.

The prosecutor described Mr Anagnostellis as a gentle man who was never violent or threatening to anyone.

Mr Gyorffy said Mr Thomas and his girlfriend, Tina Thwaites, who were both poker players, had been in a relationship for about a year when Ms Thwaites ended it some time before the alleged murder.

""Mr Thomas believed that she'd been having an affair with another poker player, Mr Billy Theoharis, and he was angry about that,"" the prosecutor told the jury.

""He was trying to track him (Mr Theoharis) down and was texting and calling his phone.

""Mr Theoharis was a good friend of the deceased man (Mr Anagnostellis).""

After playing poker at the Sandown Hotel, Mr Anagnostellis invited Mr Thomas, Andrew Heke and Scott Sullivan back to his parents' Malvern East home just after 1am on April 11.

The men went into the garage and sat around a table playing cards and drinking home-made ouzo and wine.

By 4.30am, Mr Sullivan became unwell and left the garage in a severely intoxicated state and was later picked up by his partner. Mr Heke was asleep at the table when Mr Sullivan left.

Mr Thomas then allegedly confronted Mr Anagnostellis about where he could find Mr Theoharis.

Mr Thomas later told police he assaulted Mr Anagnostellis about 20 to 30 times involving ""a mixture of punches, elbows, kicks, knees, head butts"" to the face, head and body.

""It's a bit of a blur,"" Mr Thomas told police.

""I'm not really too sure about how that went down. All I remember is getting to the point where I obviously felt angry enough to assault him.

""I was just not getting anywhere and just getting sandbagged and basically being treated like an idiot, like I didn't know anything. I wasn't getting the information, obviously, that I was after and I was getting frustrated.""

Mr Thomas wanted to find Mr Theoharis because there were accusations he had ""slept with my girlfriend (Ms Thwaites) at the time"" in late 2013.

Mr Gyorffy said Mr Anagnostellis suffered a number of serious head and neck injuries from the beating which led to his death.

""The Crown says Mr Thomas then poured petrol on the floor and over Mr Anagnostellis' body and set it alight before he left the scene.""

Defence barrister Colin Mandy told the jury Mr Thomas did not deny assaulting Mr Thomas but claimed the last time he saw him he was alive and about to set fire to himself and the garage.

""He (Mr Thomas) told the police that he dragged Andrew Heke out of there and was blown out of the door by the explosion that happened,"" Mr Mandy said.

The trial, before Justice Jack Forrest, continues. The story first appeared on The Age.",f18bbd65-57a4-414a-b78b-356b9ecb65f0,News,2015-09-30T05:46:21Z,Bendigo Advertiser,"Poker player killed love rival's friend, court hears",0.0,Blog

4409,"Simple Lang Restaurant Review What can you expect from a restaurant with such a name as Simplé Lang? You’d think it’d be a pretty simple affair as their moniker suggests, but just look at the é at the end of the first word and you’d probably have a rethink coming. As one of the outside graffiti boldly states on one of their glass walls, Simple and yet so arte! Well, that’s a dead giveaway that we’re probably dealing with a conyo restaurant right here. SIMPLE RED AND WHITE INTERIORS As I flipped through their menu, it quickly became apparent that that é has everything to do with what Simplé Lang stands for. The restaurant serves classic Filipino comfort food, but with a not-so-very-slight twists that makes them more interesting than say, finding them on you usual favorite carinderia or gotohan. Take their Pancit Tinola for example. If I had to guess what the following hour would be from that alone, I would surmise we’re gonna be in for a surprising food session. THE RESTAURANT’S OPEN KITCHEN Simplé Lang is located at the strip of food venues along the Ayala Triangle. It’s relatively new in the scene, having just opened April last year. There are outside seats for people who prefer to dine al fresco and a mezzanine, for those wanting a bit of privacy. While these restaurants are usually filled to the rafters with diners during regular days, we went there on a Sunday; the whole of Ayala was a ghost town and we had the whole floor to ourselves. SOSI CONDIMENTS AND #TUSOKTUSOK (PHP130.00) We were quite a big group and it was decided that instead of each ordering a separate dish from their menu, we’ll simply consolidate all those we wished to have into one big order, that way we can taste most of what the restaurant has to offer. FRESH LUMPIA ROLLS (PHP95.00) + ILOCOS STYLE SISIG EMPANADA (PHP175.00) Soon, plates of familiar Filipino snacks, treated with that é flair started to fill our tables. For starters we had #tusoktusok, fresh lumpia rolls, Ilocos-style sisig empanada and totoong tokwa’t baboy. The #tusoktusok is basically a mix of skewered fried streetfood usually found on your favorite street corner. It has everything from isaw, squid balls, fish balls, kikiam and even pork ears! Unfortunately, I find it to be quite ordinary—well except that you’re pretty assured that they’re very clean compared to manong’s offerings outside. By contrast, the muscovado sugar used in the sauce to lather their lumpia and the special sisig sandwiched in between the crunchy outer shells of their empanada, made these other duo a more memorable afternoon delight.   CRISPY PALABOK (PHP275.00) + PANSIT TINOLA (PHP195.00) For our main course, we decided on Simplé Lang’s crispy palabok, simpleng arroz caldo, batchoy yan, pansit tinola, totoong tokwa’t baboy and gasp, sinigang na crispy bagnet sa watermelon! I can tell that their menu borders on the outrageous, but I never did mind. I remember what I always tell people who ask me what I want to order, Surprise me. BATCHOY YAN (PHP195.00) + TOTOONG TOKWA’T BABOY (PHP195.00) The arroz caldo and batchoy—which for some reason has chunks of chopped donuts floating among the mix of anchovies, chicharon and greens (and it amazingly works, by the way)—were quite traditional in a sense that they still capture the good qualities of these usual afternoon Filipino meriendas. The spicy tokwa’t baboy, compliments these extremely well. For the noodles, pansit tinola, which I was particularly intrigued didn’t quite made it in my book. While its spaghetti noodles did capture the tinola flavor, everything else seemed soggy. I’m thinking, if they used crispy fried chicken with a stronger flavor instead of the soft tinola chicken they top it with, this dish might actually work. Being a kid who grew up in Malabon, the palabok was quite a surprise. The atsuete sauce that completes this dish is provided on a separate bowl and is mixed with the crunchy rice noodles before consumption. While it has the usual shrimp, eggs and crushed pork rind toppings, and its sauce is spot on; It is the noodle’s crisp texture that made this stand out. Majority within our group actually voted this to be Simplé Lang’s best offering. SINIGANG NA CRISPY BAGNET SA WATERMELON (PHP395.00) The sinigang, I was actually dreading. I mean, I love sinigang and I love watermelons, but I just don’t see the two coming together! What made me dip my spoon, or rather my fork, over to this dish was actually the crisply fried bagnet portions that I saw swimming along its reddish soup. This is one of the weirdest, if not the weirdest, sinigang I’ve seen and had. And the taste? I actually didn’t find it anything like sinigang. It drew mixed reactions from my friends, some immensely liked it, a few immensely didn’t. HOT GINATAANG BILO-BILO (PHP150.00) TURON BITES (PHP95.00) And if you thought that our food odyssey ended there, well, there’s still dessert! Two Filipino staples again made it to our table, hot ginataang bilo-bilo and turon bites. The ginataan, we were told, are served hot during rainy days and cold during hot days. Genius! The turon, which looked like deconstructed versions of the popular merienda, was deceivingly simple-looking but was superlatively good. SIMPLE & YET SOOO ARTE! These two won our hearts completely, making us decide that this restaurant’s food, while conyotic, was much more than what its name suggest. Simplé Lang is anything but simple.

6763,"California lawmakers are scrambling to pass lots of laws before the end of Friday, when this year’s regular session of the Legislature ends.
Follow along below for updates and analysis from The Times' Sacramento team.
3:54 P.M. Passed: Right-to-die regulations for terminally ill patients The state Senate has voted to approve and send the governor a bill that would allow physicians to prescribe life-ending drugs to Californians diagnosed as having less than six months to live. The question now is what action Gov. Jerry Brown, a former Catholic seminarian, will take on the measure. Brown has not yet taken a public position on the proposal. The measure passed with a vote of 23-14 on the Senate floor, following an emotional and passionate debate. -- Patrick McGreevy Read more Californians want us to act to eliminate the needless pain and prolonged suffering of those who are dying. Sen. Lois Wolk (D-Davis), speaking in support of the aid-in-dying bill Let's call this what it is. It's not death with dignity. It's assisted killing. Sen. Robert Huff (R-Diamond Bar) during Senate floor debate on aid-in-dying bill 3:16 P.M. Negotiations on health tax plans stall California currently imposes a tax on plans with Medi-Cal patients, but the federal government has said the state must change that to tax all managed-care organizations, or face a plunge in federal funding. Read more 3:10 P.M. Debate over right-to-die law underway 3:05 P.M. Passed: Automatic voter registration California lawmakers on Friday approved a bill that would automatically register to vote any eligible Californian who gets a driver's license or state identification card -- unless they opt out. The measure was prompted by the 42% turnout in the November election, as well as the turnout for March election in Los Angeles, in which only about 10% of eligible voters went to the polls. Nearly 7 million Californians, mostly young people, are eligible but not registered to vote. In an effort to boost the number, Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego) introduced a bill modeled on a new law in Oregon to get more people to the polls. The measure now heads to Gov. Jerry Brown for his consideration. The measure would not take effect until a new computerized voter registration database is established some time next year. --Phil Willon and Patrick McGreevy 2:41 P.M. And we're back 2:02 P.M. Questions about marijuana regulation deal Meanwhile, the state Senate is still adjourned while members attend the ceremony to honor three men who have been hailed as heroes in a French train attack. The three men grew up in Sacramento. 11:40 A.M. Working the floor for family leave 11:37 A.M. Vote on right-to-die law delayed 11:15 A.M. Images from the last-day rush 11:11 A.M. Effort to expand family leave facing resistance California state Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson, D-Santa Barbara, has said her bill would extend protection to employees of companies with 25 to 49 workers after a previous law took effect for firms with 50 or more. The bill passed the state Senate in June with a bare majority, 21 to 16. Republicans objected that it would subject businesses to lawsuits and difficulty in staffing. The California Chamber of Commerce opposes the bill as a ""job killer."" 10:22 A.M. Brittany Maynard's husband 'confident' governor would sign right-to-die law The right-to-die proposal that is before the Senate Friday morning gained momentum after Californian Brittany Maynard moved to Oregon last November so she could end her life and avoid the pain and debilitating effects of brain cancer. Her husband, Dan Diaz, noted that three days before she died, Maynard talked to Gov. Jerry Brown about her desire for California to adopt an aid-in-dying bill like Oregon's. “I am confident that the governor will listen to the 75% of Californians who do support this option, that the governor will take into consideration that this is an option for an individual voluntarily to pursue,” Diaz said. 8:50 A.M. Welcome to the last day What we're watching: A deal on medical marijuana regulations is expected to be voted on today. A proposed $2-a-pack cigarette tax is still on the table. Right-to-die legislation, which was approved by the Assembly on Wednesday, still needs to clear the Senate and the governor's desk. SB 350 -- climate change legislation that was amended this week to drop a provision to reduce oil use by 50% by 2030, much to Gov. Jerry Brown's and Senate leader Kevin de Leon's consternation -- is still pending a vote on the Assembly floor and then needs final Senate approval. 7:30 A.M. Medical marijuana regulations expected today Lawmakers who have been negotiating a plan to regulate medical marijuana in California last night said they had reached an agreement in time for the end of session today. The regulations will be divided between a couple of bills in the Senate and the Assembly. They would create a new statewide Bureau of Medical Marijuana Regulation that will issue licenses for medical cannabis dispensaries. The bills also include a carve-out for Los Angeles so it can continue to enforce regulations approved by voters. Details about the agreement are still emerging and we'll have more today, but one major implication is this: Read more 7:15 A.M. Failed: Effort to expand county boards of supervisors The Senate last night could not muster a two-thirds vote to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot that would have required large California counties, including Los Angeles, to expand their five-member boards of supervisors to at least seven members. Sen. Tony Mendoza (D-Artesia) might bring it up again Friday, but he was able to get only 24 of the 27 votes he needed on Thursday after four Democrats voted against it and Sen. Holly Mitchell (D-Los Angeles) withheld her vote. Mendoza said his proposal would increase the opportunity for minority communities to elect representatives. It would apply to all five counties with populations of 2 million people or more: Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino, Riverside and San Diego. — Patrick McGreevy Read more 7:54 P.M. Automatic voter registration plan approved California Secretary of State Alex Padilla backed the proposal to automatically register to vote every eligible Californian with a driver's license. (Robert Durell / Los Angeles Times) The state Senate approved a measure that would have eligible citizens registered to vote when they get their driver's license at the Department of Motor Vehicles unless they opt out. “Voter registration still stands as a significant impediment to voter participation in our state,” said Sen. Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens). However, all Republicans who voted opposed the bill, with some saying they are concerned that it could lead to voter fraud. Sen. Jeff Stone of Murrieta said the bill would “further undermine the integrity of our election system.” The measure has to go back to the Assembly for action on amendments and would not take effect until a new computerized voter registration database is established in about a year. -- Patrick McGreevy 6:03 P.M. Time for a break 4:54 P.M. Another climate change bill stalls Valero's Wilmington refinery in 2010. (Christina House / For The Times) It's been a rough week for climate change legislation. A measure from Sen. Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills) that would extend California's greenhouse gas reduction targets is being delayed until next year. “Unfortunately, the state Assembly and the administration were not supportive, for now, and we could not pass this important proposal,” she said in a statement. The measure, SB 32, would codify in state law long-term goals set through executive order by Gov. Jerry Brown and his predecessor, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Pavley had tried to build support for the measure by increasing legislative oversight of state regulators, something the Brown administration has resisted. The news came one day after an announcement that gasoline reduction targets were being stripped from another bill, SB 350. -- Chris Megerian 4:35 P.M. Twinsies 4:34 P.M. Assembly rejects measure to limit police seizure of assets Facing intense opposition from law enforcement groups, a measure to limit police seizures of cash, cars and other property from people not convicted of a crime fell flat in the Assembly. -- Melanie Mason Read more 4:01 P.M. Opponents blast asset-forfeiture bill in Assembly A bill that would place restrictions on police seizures of assets suspected to be tied to crimes is facing road bumps in the Assembly this afternoon. Assemblymen Donald P. Wagner (R-Irvine) and Jim Cooper (D-Elk Grove), who also is a former captain for the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department, rose to speak against the bill. As of right now, SB 443 has fallen far short of the votes it needs and is stuck on the Assembly floor at 27 votes. The matter is a telling show of force from the law enforcement lobby, which has vigorously opposed the bill. -- Melanie Mason 3:27 P.M. Senate OKs oil pipeline technology bill The Senate has approved a bill that would require the state fire marshal's office to make sure oil pipelines in scenic areas are using the latest technology to avoid spills, including automatic shutoff valves and leak detectors. ""This measure will help protect state waters,"" said Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara). The bill, AB 864 by Assemblyman Das Williams (D-Santa Barbara), now goes back to the Assembly for action on amendments. -- Patrick McGreevy 3:16 P.M. Passed: Bill would expand ban on firearm possession for convicted criminals (Transportation Security Administration) The Senate on Thursday sent the governor a bill that would increase the list of crimes that result in a 10-year ban on possessing a firearm. The bill by Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara) would extend the ban to those convicted of receiving a stolen gun and carrying ammunition onto school grounds. SB 347 was changed in the Assembly to remove crimes such as selling ammo to a minor. ""This bill will help prevent gun violence by prohibiting the purchase of firearms by people shown to be a high risk for future criminal activity,"" Jackson told her colleagues. The vote was 23 to 14. Sen. Jim Nielsen of Gerber was one of the Republicans to vote against the bill, saying the state should focus on people who commit violent crimes. -- Patrick McGreevy 3:04 P.M. Passed: A push for more inspection of pipelines Workers prepare an oil containment boom at Refugio State Beach after May's oil spill north of Santa Barbara. (Jae C. Hong / Associated Press) Alarmed by a pipeline rupture that dumped 20,000 gallons of oil into the ocean off the Santa Barbara County coast, the Senate has sent the governor a bill that would require the state fire marshal's office to annually inspect all intrastate pipelines under its jurisdiction. Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara) introduced the bill in response to the May 19 spill at Refugio State Beach from a pipeline that was being inspected every other year. “If the pipeline had been inspected more frequently, the spill could have been avoided because we would have known it was corroding more rapidly,” Jackson said in support of her bill, SB 295. A companion measure that would have banned oil drilling off the Santa Barbara coast recently failed to win support in the Assembly. -- Patrick McGreevy 1:21 P.M. Passed: Effort to suspend high school exit exam Students at Los Angeles' Francisco Bravo Medical Magnet High School practice for standardized tests in February. (Anne Cusack / Los Angeles Times) The Senate has sent the governor a bill that would suspend California's high school exit exam for three years and allow diplomas to be issued to some 40,000 students who did not pass it. SB 172, by Sen. Carol Liu (D-La Cañada Flintridge), suspends the exam through the 2017-18 school year and requires local educational agencies to grant a diploma to any student who completed 12th grade since 2004 and met all other graduation requirements. The state canceled its contract with the test-giver because the exam is not up to date with the California Common Core Standards adopted in 2010. “The exit exam is no longer being offered,” Liu told her colleagues, adding that it would be unfair to punish students who cannot take the test. Sen. Bob Huff (R-Diamond Bar) opposed suspending the requirement, saying of the test, “At least it's something that indicates that they [students] have met some educational requirements.” — Patrick McGreevy 12:58 P.M. Passed: Bill to track racial profiling by police The Assembly has passed a proposal that would require police to track racial profiling statistics, a day after the Senate did the same. The measure, AB 953 by Assemblywoman Shirley Weber (D-San Diego), was opposed by Republicans and law enforcement groups who said the requirements would be costly and onerous. The bill heads to Gov. Jerry Brown's desk. Brown has not indicated whether he would sign the bill. -- Melanie Mason 12:53 P.M. Special delivery Assemblyman Brian W. Jones (R-Santee) hands Assemblyman Tom Lackey (R-Palmdale) a bouquet. -- Sarah Parvini 12:39 P.M. Tobacco tax bills could bring first hike since 1998 A proposed $2-a-pack cigarette tax is one of the many issues yet to be decided with two days left in the legislative session. There are currently two bills under consideration that would raise the per-pack cigarette tax by $2; one of them combines it with another tax on managed-care plans. If one of the proposals ultimately becomes law, it would be the first tobacco tax increase in more than 15 years. Past efforts to raise the tax in recent years have failed. Regulations on tobacco fall under that category of issues that inspires plenty of power politics (and cash) in Sacramento. Altria, which owns Philip Morris, spent nearly $275,000 on lobbying this year alone. — Phil Willon 12:35 P.M. Passed: Higher compensation for the wrongfully convicted 12:33 P.M. Passed: Vaccination requirement for child care workers 12:20 P.M. Lots of conversations 12:08 P.M. Stop cops from 'bounty hunting,' Mitchell urges State Sen. Holly Mitchell speaks to the Senate in June. (Rich Pedroncelli / Associated Press) Sen. Holly Mitchell (D-Los Angeles) made an impassioned pitch this morning for her bill to curb police seizures of cash, cars and other property from people who have not been convicted of a crime. At a news conference, Mitchell told reporters that lobbyists for law enforcement are making ""exaggerated claims of the return to the drug kingpin days of the '80s"" in opposing the bill, SB 443. She said reforms in California were adopted 15 years ago. ""Those reforms are being sidestepped by California law enforcement in order to continue bounty hunting at the expense of California taxpayers,"" Mitchell said. ""I find that offensive."" Assemblyman Reggie Jones-Sawyer (D-Los Angeles) said of the asset forfeiture practice, ""It's a gross miscarriage of justice, and it must stop."" -- Patrick McGreevy and Melanie Mason 11:59 A.M. Bill to ban 'Redskins' as school mascot heads to governor If the governor signs the measure, all public schools would be banned from using the term ""Redskins"" for school or athletic team names, mascots or nicknames. The bill provides some flexibility to address cost issues, allowing schools to continue to use sports and band uniforms and other materials as long as they've picked a new name to use in the future and do not buy all new gear with the old name emblazoned on it. Schools would be able to replace up to 20% of uniforms with the old name, but only until Jan. 1, 2019. The bill would also prohibit schools from buying or distributing yearbooks, newspapers, programs or other materials bearing the name ""Redskins."" There are four public schools in California that use the term for their teams. One is Gustine High School in Merced County, which uses it for the football team. The town of Gustine, population 5,500, has opposed the legislation, saying the decision should be made locally. -- Melanie Mason 11:45 A.M. Passed: More transparency on who pays for lawmakers' trips An aerial shot shows Diamond Head State Monument on Hawaii's island of Oahu. (Arnie Cooper) The state Senate has approved a bill that would require some disclosure of who pays for lawmakers to attend conferences in Hawaii and other exotic locales. The measure, SB 21 by Sen. Jerry Hill (D-San Mateo), originally proposed that nonprofits that host the conferences disclose the donors. The Assembly watered the legislation down to require disclosure only of donors in the preceding year who also accompanied the elected official on the trip. Hill said the bill ""increases transparency in the Political Reform Act."" The vote was 36-0, and the bill now goes to Gov. Jerry Brown for his consideration. -- Patrick McGreevy 11:31 A.M. Health plan-tobacco tax combo clears committee The double-barreled bill that would up taxes on tobacco as well as managed-care plans cleared its first hurdle Thursday. Hernandez's bill now moves to the special session finance committee. Because it is part of the special session, the bill does not need to be passed by the Legislature by Friday's adjournment, but legislative leaders have signaled they would like a resolution by that day. The thorniest issue is how to tax health plans. California currently imposes a tax on plans with Medi-Cal patients, but the federal government has said the state must change that to tax all managed-care organizations, or face a plunge in federal funding. But though health insurers have been negotiating with Gov. Jerry Brown's administration and lawmakers to settle on a tax proposal, no consensus has emerged. All proposals would need Republican support in the Legislature, and the GOP has not signaled a willingness to sign off on more taxes. -- Melanie Mason 11:25 A.M. It's starting soon The state Assembly floor session is about to begin for the morning. But it doesn't look like everyone is quite ready to start yet. 11:03 A.M. Should cops be allowed to keep seized assets before you're convicted? Assembly takes a look One of the bigger bills that promises some true-to-fashion late-session vote-wrangling Thursday is a bill that would restrict the ability of state and local law enforcement to keep money, cars and homes seized from suspects who haven't been charged. Under federal law, law enforcement agencies can keep those seized assets if the agencies suspect they were used to commit a crime or are the proceeds of illegal activity. The owner doesn't even need to be convicted or charged with a crime. State law in California is typically stricter, requiring that the person be convicted. But there are exceptions when California authorities partner with federal officials through joint investigations or task forces, allowing local and state police to keep up to 80% of the proceeds. Under SB 443, state and local law enforcement could do so only if the person is convicted. The bill is being shepherded by an unlikely pair of lawmakers: Sen. Holly J. Mitchell of Los Angeles, one of the chamber's most liberate Democrats, and Assemblyman David Hadley, a Republican freshman from Manhattan Beach. If the measure passes the Assembly floor, it still must clear the Senate before heading to the governor's desk. — Melanie Mason and Christine Mai-Duc 10:56 A.M. Gearing up 10:04 A.M. Getting ready to rumble Assemblyman Mike Gatto (D-Glendale) posted this photo of a Capitol hallway where sergeants-at-arms appear to be preparing for a particularly busy day.

Read more on: Governance | infrastructure | JNNURM | redevelopment | retrofitting | Smart City | smart solutions 

Contributed by- Hitesh Vaidya, Practice Head (Urban Reforms), IPE Global 

The urban sector at present is going through a lot of action and upheaval. Every state and city in the country wants to hop on to the ‘Smart City’ bus. Every state is struggling intra-political and administrative battles in order to include their best horses in the “Urban Premier League”. I have never witnessed such a feeling of euphoria and fierce competitiveness amongst states and cities on discussing urban challenges and branding their best horses for undertaking this journey. 

However, surprisingly, the names which are emerging as potential candidates for this premier list are not big cities but small and medium towns. Further, a surprise factor is that erstwhile Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM ) cities are struggling to find their way into this league. 

One would have thought them as ‘low hanging fruits’, where huge infrastructure investments and reforms have already happened during the last five years and only a minimum push to introduce smart solutions was required to take them to the next level. Even the conditions laid down for participation in this race provided a clear advantage for JNNURM cities. 

The rules suggested for taking this journey towards smartness calls on cities to address two broad parameters (1) Physical Smartness: Retrofitting, Redevelopment, and Greenfield; and (2) Operational Smartness: Incorporating smart solutions for bringing operational efficiencies in cities, and responsiveness to citizens’ needs and requirements. 

Once each state has earmarked/identified their suitable candidates, the race for smartness will begin. Out of 100, only 20 will be qualified in round one to take this journey forward and the rest will be asked to prepare and again come up for the subsequent rounds. It is the first time that states and cities are competing not only in branding themselves as smart, but also in creating a unique identity for themselves. This not only represents a paradigm shift which is taking place in addressing the challenges of urban transition witnessed by India, but also sending serious policy signals to state and local governments to work in converged and coordinated frameworks for addressing the urban menace. 

However, to embark and sustain this journey is not going to be easy. Looking at the existing governance and service delivery frameworks, it is surely a daunting task and cities will require huge handholding and implementation support ranging from knowledge products, expert consultant services, hands-on training, peer-to-peer learning and knowledge sharing platforms. But the journey offers an opportunity to discard old ideas and mind-sets in changing the way we plan, implement and develop longer visionary approaches for managing cities rather than short term knee-jerk reactions, which have started haunting our governance systems at local levels.",a52e8392-e312-4bcb-912a-6685461c4d79,News,2015-09-29T12:38:35Z,EGov Online,Journey to ‘smart land': No one wants to miss the bus,0.0,Blog

29,"The Federal Savings Bank encourages all prospective home buyers and mortgage applicants to do the math and see just how much less expensive owning is versus renting.    Past News Releases RSS    
 Chicago, IL (PRWEB)  September 15, 2015  

Lenders like The Federal Savings Bank are always keeping tabs on rental markets across the USA.  Strong rental markets usually also contain strong real estate markets. 
 
The Federal Savings Bank was intrigued by data released in a CNN Money article from August 19th titled “ America's most expensive rental markets ”. 
 
Perhaps surprisingly, 10 out of the 15 markets presented resided in California.  Due to the abundance of tech companies and high salaries, Cali is the most abundantly expensive state to live in terms of rents. 
 
The average percentage of income spent on rent in all 10 California cities was above 40% for: Salinas, San Luis Obispo, San Diego, Santa Rosa, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, Napa, Santa Cruz, San Francisco, and San Jose.  Above 40% is a very high level.  For Los Angeles, where the median income is $61,482, the average percentage of income spent on rent is 48.9%. Just think of how much money could be saved by owning instead of renting! 
 
Washington D.C. while expensive at a $2,104 per month level of rent, showed the lowest percentage of income spent on rent at just 26.8% thanks to high median incomes of the area at $94,204. 
 
The Federal Savings Bank believes high costing rental markets are places that give an incentive to first-time home buyers the most to purchase a property.  With home prices on the rise and 30-year fixed mortgage rates continuing to trend sub 4%, now is an affordable time to purchase a property. 
 
The Federal Savings Bank encourages all prospective home buyers and mortgage applicants to do the math and see just how much less expensive owning is versus renting.  Frequently, the cost of a mortgage + property taxes + association fees are less than the monthly cost of rent!

40,"Facebook may finally be getting a button that lets you quickly express something beyond a ""like."" 

Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Tuesday that people have been asking for a ""dislike"" button on the social media site for years. 

Speaking at an event at Facebook's Menlo Park, California, headquarters that was streamed live online, Zuckerberg acknowledged that ""like"" isn't always appropriate for some posts — about a tragic news event, for example — when people might want to express empathy. 

Zuckerberg said the company, however, has veered away from making a ""dislike"" button, which could be used to vote down other people's posts. He said the new button is ready to be tested soon and could be rolled out broadly depending on how it does.

3280,"New Delhi, Sept 3: The RSS is particulary concerned about the high rate of infiltration from Bangladesh . In its three day coordination meeting with the BJP , the RSS is likely to tell the government to take seriously the problem of infiltrations especially from Bangladesh as this could change the demographics in some states. 

The RSS and the BJP are holding a three day coordination meeting at the National capital and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to participate on Friday. 


File photo. West Bengal Bangladesh border 
  

Give priority to infiltrations: 

The RSS is concerned about the influx of Muslims from Bangladesh. It will tell the BJP to handle the issue with top priority as the census shows that there are a large number of people coming in from Bangladesh and settling down in the states of West Bengal and Assam. 

Also read:  RSS favours immediate implementation of OROP 

The RSS feels that if this issue is not addressed with seriousness then the demographics will change and could prove dangerous in the long run. The Intelligence Bureau too had raised a red flag on the number of people coming in from Bangladesh and settling down in the states of West Bengal and Assam. 

Focus on Nepal as well: 

In addition to the issue of Bangladesh, the RSS will also rake up the Nepal issue with the BJP. The RSS feels that the Nepal border has become an easy entry and exit point and this should be a focus for the government. 

In the recent past we have seen several anti nationals using the Nepal-India border to enter and exit. The RSS is of the view that the activities along the Indo-Nepal border must be curbed. There is a need to fix this issue immediately or else it could snow ball into a major problem, the RSS would also inform the BJP which is running the government at the centre. 

OROP row: 

The One Rank One Pension row will also be an issue to be raked up when the Prime Minister attends the coordination meet tomorrow. The RSS will tell the BJP to find an immediate solution to the problem as dragging would only lower the image of the government. 

The RSS feels that the OROP is an extremely emotive issue and needs to be resolved immediately. Dragging it is not in the interest of the government and with the veterans protesting on the streets, it could hurt the government's image if there is a delay, the RSS feels.

5985,"Fast-growing HR technology company takes top sponsorship role at annual CUPA-HR event; furthers commitment to the talent management needs of colleges and universities 
 
Austin, Texas (PRWEB) September 23, 2015 

PeopleAdmin, the leader in talent management for higher education, K-12 and government, continues to demonstrate its commitment to helping colleges and universities recruit, hire and develop top faculty and staff by announcing today a major sponsorship role at the CUPA-HR Annual Conference & Expo in Orlando, Florida, Sept. 27-29. 
 
The annual event, hosted by the College and University Professional Association for Human Resources ( CUPA-HR ), expects to draw over 1,000 attendees and 100 vendors. It is one of the largest annual gatherings of HR professionals in higher education; CUPA-HR is considered the voice of higher education human resources. 
 
This year, PeopleAdmin is a Mary Ann Wersch Premier Partner, CUPA-HR’s highest-level of partnership. 
“We have worked with PeopleAdmin for many years and are very pleased to acknowledge and celebrate this new level of partnership,” said Andy Brantley, President and CEO, CUPA-HR. “CUPA-HR’s Mary Ann Wersch Premier Partners are industry thought leaders who fully engage with CUPA-HR to help provide essential knowledge and resources to higher education and the higher education human resources community.” 
 
“This is our 13th year at this event, and we’re excited to deepen our partnership with CUPA-HR and all its members, especially as PeopleAdmin continues to focus on growth to better serve our new and existing customers,” said PeopleAdmin CEO Kermit Randa. “We welcome this opportunity to help higher education institutions tackle some of today’s top talent management challenges with better technology strategies and solutions.” 
 
As evidence of its growth, PeopleAdmin in June was selected as a Tyton Growth50 company, placing it among “the most important growth-stage companies in education,” according to Tyton Partners, a long-time provider of investment banking and strategy consulting for the global knowledge sector. 
 
Randa said that for HR to earn a seat at the executive table, it needs strategic insight and visibility into the entire talent management process, so institutions can use improved reporting and analytics to make better business decisions that support their academic missions. PeopleAdmin’s cloud-based talent management solution, SelectSuite®, helps HR departments do that. 
 
“We appreciate the fact that PeopleAdmin is focused on higher education,” said Corrie Mimms, employment consultant, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “We've seen other products that weren't focused on higher ed, and the functionality we needed just wasn't available.” 
 
Also, for the third year, PeopleAdmin continues its sponsorship of the HR Innovation Award for developing new and innovative HR models that can be easily adapted by other campuses. Randa will award the honors to Alamo Colleges, Texas Tech University and the University of California, Irvine. 
 
PeopleAdmin serves a third of all educators and administrators across the entire education spectrum, who in turn serve more than 30 percent of all students in America.

The three Michelin-starred chef known for upscale fare will loosen his apron for a 40,000-square-foot food hall to open at the end of 2017, according to Steve Cuozzo of the NY Post. Vongerichten is also creating a casual restaurant on Pier 17, which will open sometime in 2017.

7891,"Acts 3
1 One day Peter and John were going up to the temple. It was three o’clock in the afternoon. It was the time for prayer. 2 A man unable to walk was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful. He had been that way since he was born. Every day someone put him near the gate. There he would beg from people going into the temple courtyards. 3 He saw that Peter and John were about to enter. So he asked them for money. 4 Peter looked straight at him, and so did John. Then Peter said, “Look at us!” 5 So the man watched them closely. He expected to get something from them.
6 Peter said, “I don’t have any silver or gold. But I’ll give you what I do have. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk.” 7 Then Peter took him by the right hand and helped him up. At once the man’s feet and ankles became strong. 8 He jumped to his feet and began to walk. He went with Peter and John into the temple courtyards. He walked and jumped and praised God. 9 All the people saw him walking and praising God. 10 They recognized him as the same man who used to sit and beg at the temple gate called Beautiful. They were filled with wonder. They were amazed at what had happened to him.

11 The man was holding on to Peter and John. All the people were amazed. They came running to them at the place called Solomon’s Porch. 12 When Peter saw this, he said, “Fellow Israelites, why does this surprise you? Why do you stare at us? It’s not as if we’ve made this man walk by our own power or godliness. 13 The God of our fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, has done this. God has brought glory to Jesus, who serves him. But you handed Jesus over to be killed. Pilate had decided to let him go. But you spoke against Jesus when he was in Pilate’s court. 14 You spoke against the Holy and Blameless One. You asked for a murderer to be set free instead. 15 You killed the one who gives life. But God raised him from the dead. We are witnesses of this. 16 This man whom you see and know was made strong because of faith in Jesus’ name. Faith in Jesus has healed him completely. You can see it with your own eyes.

17 “My fellow Israelites, I know you didn’t realize what you were doing. Neither did your leaders. 18 But God had given a promise through all the prophets. And this is how he has made his promise come true. He said that his Messiah would suffer. 19 So turn away from your sins. Turn to God. Then your sins will be wiped away. The time will come when the Lord will make everything new. 20 He will send the Messiah. Jesus has been appointed as the Messiah for you. 21 Heaven must receive him until the time when God makes everything new. He promised this long ago through his holy prophets. 22 Moses said, ‘The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me. He will be one of your own people. You must listen to everything he tells you. 23 Anyone who does not listen to him will be completely cut off from their people.’ (Deuteronomy 18:15,18,19)

24 “Beginning with Samuel, all the prophets spoke about this. They said these days would come. 25 What the prophets said was meant for you. The covenant God made with your people long ago is yours also. He said to Abraham, ‘All nations on earth will be blessed through your children.’ (Genesis 22:18; 26:4) 26 God raised up Jesus, who serves him. God sent him first to you. He did it to bless you. He wanted to turn each of you from your evil ways.”
Acts 4
1 Peter and John were speaking to the people. The priests, the captain of the temple guard, and the Sadducees came up to the apostles. 2 They were very upset by what the apostles were teaching the people. The apostles were saying that people can be raised from the dead. They said this can happen because Jesus rose from the dead. 3 So the temple authorities arrested Peter and John. It was already evening, so they put them in prison until the next day. 4 But many who heard the message believed. The number of men who believed grew to about 5,000.
5 The next day the rulers, the elders and the teachers of the law met in Jerusalem. 6 Annas, the high priest, was there. So were Caiaphas, John, Alexander and other people in the high priest’s family. 7 They had Peter and John brought to them. They wanted to question them. “By what power did you do this?” they asked. “And through whose name?”

8 Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit. He said to them, “Rulers and elders of the people! 9 Are you asking us to explain our actions today? Do you want to know why we were kind to a man who couldn’t walk? Are you asking how he was healed? 10 Then listen to this, you and all the people of Israel! You nailed Jesus Christ of Nazareth to the cross. But God raised him from the dead. It is through Jesus’ name that this man stands healed in front of you. 11 Scripture says that Jesus is

“ ‘the stone you builders did not accept.
    But it has become the most important stone of all.’ (Psalm 118:22)


12 You can’t be saved by believing in anyone else. God has given people no other name under heaven that will save them.”
13 The leaders saw how bold Peter and John were. They also realized that Peter and John were ordinary men with no training. This surprised the leaders. They realized that these men had been with Jesus. 14 The leaders could see the man who had been healed. He was standing there with them. So there was nothing they could say. 15 They ordered Peter and John to leave the Sanhedrin. Then they talked things over. 16 “What can we do with these men?” they asked. “Everyone living in Jerusalem knows they have performed an unusual miracle. We can’t say it didn’t happen. 17 We have to stop this thing. It must not spread any further among the people. We have to warn these men. They must never speak to anyone in Jesus’ name again.”
18 Once again the leaders called in Peter and John. They commanded them not to speak or teach at all in Jesus’ name. 19 But Peter and John replied, “Which is right from God’s point of view? Should we listen to you? Or should we listen to God? You be the judges! 20 There’s nothing else we can do. We have to speak about the things we’ve seen and heard.”

21 The leaders warned them again. Then they let them go. They couldn’t decide how to punish Peter and John. They knew that all the people were praising God for what had happened. 22 The man who had been healed by the miracle was over 40 years old.

23 Peter and John were allowed to leave. They went back to their own people. They reported everything the chief priests and the elders had said to them. 24 The believers heard this. Then they raised their voices together in prayer to God. “Lord and King,” they said, “you made the heavens, the earth and the sea. You made everything in them. 25 Long ago you spoke by the Holy Spirit. You spoke through the mouth of our father David, who served you. You said,

“ ‘Why are the nations angry?
    Why do the people make useless plans?
26 The kings of the earth rise up.
    The rulers of the earth gather together
against the Lord
    and against his anointed king.’ (Psalm 2:1,2)


27 In fact, Herod and Pontius Pilate met with the Gentiles in this city. They also met with the people of Israel. All of them made plans against your holy servant Jesus. He is the one you anointed. 28 They did what your power and purpose had already decided should happen. 29 Now, Lord, consider the bad things they say they are going to do. Help us to be very bold when we speak your word. 30 Stretch out your hand to heal. Do signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”
31 After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit. They were bold when they spoke God’s word.
32 All the believers were agreed in heart and mind. They didn’t claim that anything they had was their own. Instead, they shared everything they owned. 33 With great power the apostles continued their teaching. They were telling people that the Lord Jesus had risen from the dead. And God’s grace was working powerfully in all of them. 34 So there were no needy persons among them. From time to time, those who owned land or houses sold them. They brought the money from the sales. 35 They put it down at the apostles’ feet. It was then given out to anyone who needed it.

36 Joseph was a Levite from Cyprus. The apostles called him Barnabas. The name Barnabas means Son of Help. 37 Barnabas sold a field he owned. He brought the money from the sale.

1514,"SAN DIEGO, Sept.  03, 2015  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Shareholders Foundation, Inc. announces that a lawsuit was filed on behalf of certain purchasers of shares of Edison International ( NYSE:EIX ) over alleged Violations of Federal Securities Laws by Edison International. 

Investors who purchased shares of Edison International ( NYSE:EIX ) have certain options and for certain investors are short and strict deadlines running. Deadline: September 4 2015. ( NYSE:EIX ) investors should contact the Shareholders Foundation at mail@shareholdersfoundation.com or call +1(858) 779 - 1554. 
    
The plaintiff claims that defendants made certain false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that Edison International’s ex parte contacts with the California Public Utilities Commission decision makers were more extensive than the Company had reported to the California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”), that belated disclosure of Edison’s ex parte contacts with the CPUC personnel would jeopardize the Company’s $3.3 billion dollar San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station Settlement, and that as a result of the above, Edison International’s financial statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. 
 
According to the Complaint, on June 22, 2015, the law firm Strumwasser & Woocher released an independent report commissioned by the CPUC in connection with a review of ex parte meetings between utility lobbyists or executives and the CPUC decision makers.  The report described such ex parte meetings as ""frequent, pervasive, and at least sometimes outcome-determinative,"" and recommended banning them altogether in rate cases. 
 
On June 24, 2015, in response to the report and earlier disclosures by Edison's largest subsidiary, Southern California Edison, the Utility Reform Network (""TURN"") filed an application with the CPUC that charged Southern California Edison with ""fraud by concealment"" and urged the CPUC to set aside the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station Settlement and reopen its investigation. 
 
On June 24, 2015, a report was published that stated Edison International stock declined ""in reaction to news that the Utility Reform Network consumer group is recommending the California Public Utilities Commission throw out the already-approved settlement in the San Onofre nuclear plant investigation.""

859,"Whether they're crashing into the bleachers or simply hovering above stadiums to get a cool picture of the action down below, drones have become semi-regular guests at the ballparks these days. 

That has put the federal government, local police forces and security think tanks on alert, trying to catch up to the technology and figure out how to prevent the hard-to-stop devices from doing major damage. 

""It's scary for all of us,"" said Lou Marciani, the director of the National Center for Spectator Sports Safety and Security. ""A crash, even without a payload, has the potential to injure several people. And if they carry a payload, it could be anything from a weapon to anthrax to something worse than that."" 

Drone crashes, two days apart, at the U.S. Open in New York and before a Kentucky football game, made news earlier this month. But over the past two years, more than 50 unmanned aircrafts have flown over Major League Baseball and NFL stadiums, coming and going quietly — usually controlled by a hobbyist who either lost control of the device or wanted a picture of their favorite team in action. 

No harm done. But the prospect of the drones doing something worse has security experts looking for answers, and quickly. 

Last October, the Federal Aviation Administration issued notice that it's illegal to fly drones near Major League Baseball, NFL and NCAA Division I college football games and major auto races. Other sporting events can put their own bans in place. But the penalties for violating a ban — and who hands out those sentences — is still murky. 

In the Kentucky case, campus police brought wanton endangerment charges against the owner of the wayward drone; at the U.S. Open, New York police brought similar charges against a high school science teacher who lost control of his drone. 

The FAA issued a ""law enforcement guidance"" paper to help local jurisdictions figure out this new problem. It lists its own enforcement tools — including warning notices, letters of correction and civil penalties — but suggests state and local police do most of the work to detect the drones and enforce the penalties. 

In its notice about temporary flight restrictions at sporting events, the FAA lists reckless endangerment, operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence, trespassing and assault as possible criminal charges for unsanctioned drone use. 

Much of this, experts say, is the result of seat-of-the-pants law- and rule-making to combat a new and very fluid problem. And none of it addresses the most important issue: How to prevent a drone from coming into a stadium in the first place. 

""So much of this is unknown and so much of it raises so many questions,"" said Derek Catsam of University of Texas of the Permian Basin, who studies stadium security issue. ""It's a case of where the technology is so far ahead of our ability to come to grips with it."" 

There are around 2,500 Major League Baseball games a year, so 31 drone sightings last year and nine so far this season does not constitute a major crisis, said John Skinner, the director of security for MLB. Still, baseball took part in a government project called ""Operation Foul Ball"" last year at the All-Star Game in Minneapolis to try to detect drones. 

Skinner said Minneapolis police worked with the Department of Homeland Security on a system that could identify the radio frequencies of drones before they took off. 

""In essence, it worked,"" he said. 

But it didn't necessarily protect against the drones taking off; one found its way to the stadium during the home run derby. Also, there are private companies that can provide the same service using similar technology, and some of the teams have been approached about working with those companies. 

Among the dozens of uses for drones at sports facilities is attaching cameras to get before-impossible angles for the TV broadcasts. In January, ESPN cleared numerous regulatory hurdles so it could have drones with cameras follow skiers and snowboarders down the hill for the Winter X Games. 

ESPN got approval only by ensuring it would not fly the drones over spectators or in the air space of planes flying in and out of a nearby airport. 

Chris Calcinari, who spearheaded the approvals process for ESPN, called it a big opportunity because ""I don't think there are many events that would actually allow us to fly a drone."" 

Another application: For security. It's possible that drones themselves could be used to keep renegade drones away from fans. And a drone can hover over a stadium to look for weapons, fights and other disruptions.

6112,"They settled one dispute with the tax man in the Supreme Court, but the Obeids are waging a bigger war in the Federal Court. 

The Obeid family is pressing ahead with a Federal Court challenge to multimillion-dollar tax bills, after settling a related case in the Supreme Court.

Fairfax Media revealed on Tuesday that family matriarch Judith, the wife of disgraced former Labor minister Eddie, two daughters and three daughters-in-law had resolved a dispute with the ATO over an $8 million bill.

It is unknown how much the women paid to settle the Supreme Court case, but it is believed to be in the millions.

Under Australian income tax laws, the women had virtually no legal grounds to challenge the bills in that court. But a bigger fight is underway in the Federal Court to challenge the bills.

Four of Mr and Mrs Obeid's five sons and a corporate trustee representing 24 grandchildren are also challenging smaller bills sent to them in 2013 after an audit by the Tax Office.

The bills relate to a $30 million coal deal exposed in a corruption inquiry. The Federal Court case centres on whether the proceeds were ordinary income –and taxed at the full tax rate – or on capital account, which attracts a 50 per cent discount.

That in turn centres on the question of whether the family intended to keep their investment in a coal mine over their Mount Penny property or sell it immediately for a profit.

The Federal Court heard on Wednesday that Cascade Coal, a mining company which entered into a mining joint venture with the Obeids before buying out their interest, had produced a large box of documents that may be used in evidence in the case.

Cascade Coal was stripped of its coal exploration licence over the Obeids' property after the Independent Commission Against Corruption found the area was opened for mining because of a corrupt agreement between Mr Obeid, his middle son Moses and then-mining minister Ian Macdonald.

Another mining company that was stripped of a coal exploration licence following a separate corruption inquiry, NuCoal, will learn on Thursday if its Supreme Court challenge to ICAC's recommendations was successful.

No adverse findings were made against NuCoal but the watchdog recommended the licence be torn up because the circumstances in which it was initially awarded to a separate company meant it was ""tainted"" by corruption.

A court victory for NuCoal, which says innocent investors have been burnt by the licence cancellation, could pave the way for it to seek compensation from the state government.

2206,"POREspective Acne Control logo 
  POREspective is a salvation for acne sufferers who have been failed repeatedly by expensive medications and dermatologist visits.  
 Austin, TX (PRWEB)  September 15, 2015  

POREspective, formerly SkinFit Austin, is proud to introduce its new identity, product packaging and enhanced website. Aimed at elevating branding and increasing differentiation and distance from competitors, the changes position the company for major growth and leadership in the acne control space. Licensed esthetician Alissa Chasen, who garnered national acclaim after founding SkinFit Austin in 2011, remains the face of the company. 
 
“POREspective is a salvation for acne sufferers who have been failed repeatedly by expensive medications and dermatologist visits,” said Chasen. “Our new brand identity and website allow us to connect even more powerfully with new and existing clients while remaining laser-focused on what we do best: clearing acne. We offer proven skin care products and personalized services, and our complimentary acne analysis and convenient in-person, phone or FaceTime consultations make it easy for anyone to get started.” 
 
The POREspective method clears six distinct acne types and includes individualized acne treatments, home care regimens, nutritional recommendations, and lifestyle education. 
 
The new POREspective website was designed and built entirely with the user in mind. It includes a nutrition blog, the ability to upload a photo and receive an online acne analysis, and a more robust e-commerce experience, among other features. Most importantly, it allows users to more quickly and easily browse POREspective’s comprehensive line of products and find acne products based on their specific needs.  For those wanting additional assistance, Acne Care Consultants are available to work one-on-one to create personalized acne treatment plans. 
 
“We believe acne is 20% inherited and 80% self-inflicted and that no single acne home care or treatment regimen is right for everyone,” continued Chasen. “POREspective is the only acne clinic in the U.S. that combines proven dermatology products and treatments with holistic nutrition and a functional medicine approach to identify the root cause of a client’s acne. By addressing the underlying causes of the disease through education, lifestyle choices, and an acne-safe topical care program, rather than the dermatologist approach of merely treating symptoms with oral antibiotics and Accutane, we can achieve clear skin and improved whole body health.” 
 
Once an acne sufferer herself, Chasen has 20 years of experience in health care, dermatology, and acne treatment . Prior to founding POREspective, she held a wellness position with Methodist Health Care System’s Institute for Preventative Medicine and held pharmaceutical positions with Bristol-Myers Squibb and the dermatology division of Sanofi-Aventis. She has completed training in the anatomy and physiology of acne and pharmacology of prescription-level and over-the-counter (OTC) acne medications. Specializing in treating acne, pigmentation and acne scars, Chasen has personally cleared the skin of more than 600 clients over the last four years, both in-clinic and through virtual consultations with a proven set of treatment protocols and acne home care products. Chasen personally tests and approves all new product formulations with partner laboratories in California, Florida, and Texas. 
 
While the causes of acne vary from person to person, Chasen offers three practical tips everyone can use to help get clearer skin and reduce breakouts: 


  Take a 2-week dairy vacation. Cows’ milk increases insulin levels and kicks oil production into high gear, causing acne. Try substituting the cream in coffee or the milk in oatmeal for carrageenan-free almond milk.  Keep mobile phone screens clean. Touchscreens transfer dirt and germs from fingers to faces. Use a cleansing wipe or rubbing alcohol every few days. Better yet, use headphones.  Modify workout habits. Dirty yoga mats, bike helmets, hats, and sweat all contribute to breakouts. Clean skin and all exercise props before and after workouts.  
POREspective offers complimentary online acne analyses and accepts new clients via clinical appointments and virtual FaceTime or phone acne consultations. In-clinic services include: new client consultations, acne treatment, back acne treatment and emergency extractions. POREspective Acne Control kits and other products are available exclusively on the company’s website and at its flagship Austin acne clinic . More information about POREspective, Alissa Chasen and the company’s products and services is available at http://www.porespective.com . 
 
About POREspective: 
POREspective is skin care that defies the ineffective one-size-fits-all approach to treating acne. Driven to find an effective alternative to frustrating dermatologist visits and expensive medications that don’t work, POREspective researchers created an easy-to-use home care system that combines a comprehensive line of acne products with proven nutrition and lifestyle modifications to individually treat and clear six unique types of acne commonly seen in teens and adults. POREspective also provides in-person treatments in its Austin-based clinic, offers virtual consultations, and maintains a wealth of free advice and information on its website.

265,"Studio 247 Fine Jewelry opened Sept. 1, 2015 in Grand Chute. (Photo: File) 

Studio 247 Fine Jewelry opened Tuesday at 247 S. Nicolet Road in Grand Chute. 

Its large, luxurious jewelry boutique space, between Willows Bend and Gather Americana, is familiar to high-end shoppers as it once was Earth Resources founded by the late John Barlow and owned by his daughter Alice. 

Studio 247 is making good use of Earth Resources’ wood-trimmed glass jewelry cases and counters for its red carpet-worthy classic necklaces and earrings. 

Craig Slavens, Studio 247 co-owner, knows the space well as he was a jewelry designer at Earth Resources for three years, several years before its 2012 closure. 

Studio 247 is a different kind of jewelry store, he said, because it doesn’t just carry high-end and custom jewelry. 

Bracelet designed by Craig Slavens of Studio 247 Fine Jewelry in Grand Chute.   (Photo: Courtesy of Craig Slavens) 

“We have unusual, one-of-a-kind pieces in every price range,” he said. 

“It has upscale decor, and we love the space, but we want everyone to feel comfortable. Sure, we want the $40,000 sale, but we don’t want someone with a few hundred to spend to feel out of place. One woman just purchased a pair of amber earrings for $245.” 

He and shop co-owner Milada Rice added wedding rings and displays of wear-everyday jewelry that can be as little as $50 for a handmade pair of sterling silver earrings. An estate jewelery counter includes cameos that had been photographed for Vogue. 

Rice is also assembling a side room of vintage accessories, starting with her grandmother’s own high-end collection of handbags, shoes and hats. Their family operates Rice Family Industries and Waupaca Elevator Co. 

Slavens, a Californian, is a gemologist, designer and expert on both rare pink diamonds and diamond grading. One of his designs in the shop is a pink pear-shaped diamond ring for $42,500. 

A rare pink pear-shaped diamond is paired with white diamonds in Craig Slavens' ""bypass"" ring design.   (Photo: Courtesy of Craig Slavens) 

When he learned this space was available, he began working on a plan for it with the Rice family.  After Earth Resources, he moved to Arkansas, near family, and continued to design and manufacture his own high end jewelry line. He earned an American Gem Trade Association Spectrum Design Award for a bridal necklace in 2012. 

The new jewelry shop could easily fit into a larger city. 

“I like Wisconsin, I like the people, the seasons, the cost of living,” he said. “You may sell more elsewhere, but you have a higher overhead. I enjoy the customers here. They’re real.” 

Meanwhile, Rice said anyone who knew Slavens would be happy he has returned. “Everyone loves Craig,” she said. “He’s down to earth and very kind.”

5016,"Press Releases USA, 20 September 2015 -- An Electronic Dance Music (EDM) producer is spearheading the Afghan music evolution with the release of his second album set to hit stores later this year. As a blend of Progressive House, Electronica and Dubstep, Shuja Rabbani pioneers a sound that’s energetic, upbeat and enlightened. 

Born in Afghanistan, raised in Australia and currently living in Dubai, Rabbani is a well-travelled individual with a lifelong passion for electronic dance music. He kicked off his career with a self-produced album titled 'Afghan Provocateur' and is now working on a follow up record. The wild global success of his first album saw Rabbani make history as the first Afghan EDM producer to be widely distributed in over 200 digital stores across 100 countries. 

Since the USA invaded Afghanistan in 2001, the country has endured a violent stigma and next to no attention from the Western music industry. Determined to expose Afghanistan beyond the war scenes, Rabbani represents a new era of artist for the Afghan music scene. While most musicians in Afghanistan still embrace traditional sounds and instruments, Rabbani is pioneering a new kind of sound. Through his global success he hopes to introduce the younger Afghan generation to the EDM genre. As well as familiarising Afghanistan with the EDM genre Rabbani also has his sights set on going down in history as the country’s best-selling artist. 

While Rabbani expresses himself through high energy EDM beats, his album represents so much more than simply a collection of tracks. By infiltrating Afghanistan’s borders with EDM sounds Rabbani is advocating for the creation of a modern and open minded nation. He is an invaluable part of the cultural reform and hopes that his beats will showcase that there’s more to Afghanistan than the scenes of terror so ruthlessly portrayed by the media. 

“I have a fervour for both EDM beats and the modernisation of my native country. By pursuing my love of creating wicked electro dance beats I’ve managed to blend both these passions into a meaningful second career that I hope will change the face of contemporary Afghanistan and inspire the Afghan youth to go beyond Afghanistan’s borders in pursuit of artistic success,” says Rabbani. 

Throughout 2014 Rabbani worked on completing his first album while juggling a full time job as a Human Resources professional, and becoming one of the most influential bloggers and highly outspoken social media personalities in Afghanistan. For young Afghans wanting to pursue both lucrative careers and a love for music, Rabbani is an inspiration. He is a prime example of how the right mind-set can foster the achievement of multiple goals. 

Since launching on iTunes, Beatport, Amazon, Spotify and Google Play alongside international artists earlier this year, Rabbani’s debut album has already drummed up over 100,000 Facebook viewers, with tracks such as 'Agent Provocateur,' 'Basement Dance Floor' and 'Juice' emerging as instant favourites. 

Rabbani keeps his fans in the loop via an active SoundCloud channel where he regularly releases free music tracks. All are recorded at 120 bpm which makes them ready to spin by club DJs in search of unique sounds.

6256,"Luke Shaw pledged to “come back stronger” following a broken leg suffered on Tuesday, United boss Louis van Gaal adding: “I hope he will play again this season”. 
 
United manager Louis van Gaal will be doubly keen to put his side’s opening fixture in the group stage of the 2015/16 UEFA Champions League behind him – not only did his team surrender a one-goal lead against PSV Eindhoven but they will now be without the services of England full-back Luke Shaw for several months. 
 
Shaw, 20, suffered a double fracture of his right leg in the first half, receiving oxygen and treatment on the pitch before being taken off on a stretcher. 
 
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg on Tuesday 
 
“I’m not a doctor so I cannot say, but when you have a double fracture it is four to six months,” Van Gaal said after the match. “But you can never say that in advance. He won’t play in the group stage, I don’t think. I hope he will play again this season.” 
 
The left-back, who joined United from Southampton in June 2014 for a fee in the region of €40m, has been one of United’s outstanding players so far this season, earning rave reviews from team-mates and pundits alike. He also featured in England’s last two UEFA EURO 2016 qualifiers as Roy Hodgson’s side confirmed their place in next summer’s finals. 
 
“Before the start of the campaign Van Gaal said: ‘I think that this will be the season of Luke Shaw – that I believe’,” the BBC wrote following the game. “In a somewhat stodgy start to the new season for United, Shaw had shone as he looked leaner, sharper and more settled than during a mixed first year at Old Trafford.” 
 
Shaw earned himself praise from the United manager following his decision – after a stop-start debut campaign at Old Trafford – to improve his fitness in the post-season and has reaped the rewards this term, demonstrating a more developed attacking game, an extra turn of pace and signs of a flourishing understanding with new signing Anthony Martial. 
 
Ex-United star Owen Hargreaves was in little doubt at how big a blow the loss of Shaw will be to United’s prospects this term: “You saw Daley Blind playing as a left-back [for the rest of the game] and he can play there, but Shaw’s virtually irreplaceable for this United team.”",1efd2a56-baa1-40b4-91a3-7d65ec040c51,News,2015-09-16T15:07:43Z,Vanguard,I hope Luke Shaw will play again this season — Louis van Gaal,0.0,News

4936,"Here’s a look at the Raiders’ current 53-man roster. It’s always a fluid situation, especially with some areas that could use an upgrade (secondary, backup offensive line being the biggest needs).  

 Quarterbacks  Derek Carr, Matt McGloin: McGloin beat out Christian Ponder to serve as the backup and the Raiders have too many other needs elsewhere to have three QBs. If the Raiders have to go beyond these two, they’re in trouble already and Ponder or someone else out there of his caliber would probably be available.   Running backs  Latavius Murray, Roy Helu Jr., Taiwan Jones: Murray’s the lead back, Helu’s the third-down back, Jones is the change of pace and probably handle kick returns.   Fullbacks  Marcel Reece, Jamize Olawale: Reece also provides protection at tailback and Olawale is the true fullback and has special teams value.   Wide receivers  Amari Cooper, Michael Crabtree, Rod Streater, Andre Holmes, Brice Butler, Seth Roberts: Cooper and Crabtree are your starters. Who’s the No. 3? Still up in the air. Holmes is coming back from a broken hand and Butler and Roberts have looked good. Streater is still getting back up to speed. Any way it’s sliced, this group is solid and has great depth.   Tight ends  Lee Smith, Mychal Rivera, Clive Walford, Gabe Holmes: Didn’t expect the Raiders to keep four, which might not be a great sign about Walford’s health.   Offensive line  Donald Penn, Gabe Jackson, Rodney Hudson, J’Marcus Webb, Austin Howard, Khalif Barnes, Jon Feliciano, Matt McCants, Tony Bergstrom: Bergstrom may have been a surprise, but not so much when you consider he played the whole game Thursday at center. Feliciano can play there, but doesn’t look like the Raiders think he’s ready. McCants had an awful final preseason game, but had been pretty good before then.    Defensive line  Khalil Mack, Justin Tuck, Dan Williams, Justin Ellis, Denico Autry, Benson Mayowa, Mario Edwards Jr., Stacy McGee: The Raiders still list Mack at LB, but that’s not fooling anybody. A guy like Autry may not start, but he can be impactful. Mayowa is a good depth guy who is gaining experience playing SAM linebacker too. Edwards has a chance to develop into a good pass rusher.   Linebackers  Curtis Lofton, Ray-Ray Armstrong, Malcolm Smith, Lorenzo Alexander, Ben Heeney, Neiron Ball: Not a group to get wildly excited about. Could be another area to try to upgrade.   Cornerbacks  TJ Carrie, DJ Hayden, Keith McGill, Neiko Thorpe, Dexter McDonald, SaQuan Edward, Chimdi Chekwa: The fact that none of the other five CBs on the roster have provided a serious threat to supplant Hayden tells you what you need to know. Help is needed here.   Safeties  Charles Woodson, Nate Allen, Larry Asante: Anybody really think the Raiders go into the season with just three safeties?   Specialists  K Sebastian Janikowski, P Marquette King, LS Jon Condo: Solid group there. No return specialists, meaning for now it’s probably Taiwan Jones and TJ Carrie.",17feb952-5450-44a7-b681-9d1d3706ce91,Blog,2015-09-06T01:44:24Z,Inside the Oakland Raiders,Quick look at the Raiders’ 53-man roster,1.0,Blog

1071,"According to a security researcher, all it takes is a laser and pulse generator to trick a self-driving car. 

0shares 

A simple trick can bring your self-driving car to a grinding halt, according to one security researcher. 

Speaking to IEEE last week, Jonathan Petit, a principal scientist at software security company Security Innovation, said he developed a way to either slow down a self-driving car or bring it to a halt. 

Petit developed ""a kind of laser pointer"" that combines a low-power laser and a pulse generator. When it's pointed at a self-driving car, it will trick the vehicle into thinking something is ahead and slow it down. If the laser pointer overwhelms the sensors on the car, the self-driving vehicle will stop. 

Self-driving cars, which were initially popularized by Google but are now in the works at most major car makers, are widely viewed as a means to reduce congestion and improve safety on our roads. Self-driving cars use a series of sensors, lasers, and GPS technology to roam around town. All the while, the person in the car doesn't need to steer or press the gas—the car does it all. 

The trouble, however, is that a self-driving car's reliance upon laser-ranging systems, called Lidar, makes it susceptible to Petit's hack, he said. Lidar, which is not used in every self-driving vehicle technology, but is running in some, attempts to create a 3D rendering of the car's surroundings by using pulses of laser light. When Petit's technology is beamed back at the Lidar system, it believes there's a pedestrian or another object around it and reacts accordingly. 

Whether the hack will actually work in real life, however, remains to be seen. Petit tested his own technology on Lidar systems, but not on actual automated vehicles. It's also worth noting that self-driving cars are still several years off and security will be a major concern for companies. Finding bugs and addressing them sooner rather than later will undoubtedly be a focus, and sidestepping this nasty item may already be on a carmaker's docket. 

Still, it highlights an important fact: despite claims that they're safe, questions abound over how these vehicles will behave when they actually hit the roads. 

Petit will talk more about his findings at the Black Hat Europe security conference in November.",b8eefa0e-1f59-4e04-ab51-333a62b63a56,News,2015-09-08T13:56:51Z,PC Magazine,A $60 Laser Can Bring Your Self-Driving Car to a Screeching Halt,0.0,News
4553,"BEHOLD, BLESS (affectionately and gratefully praise) the Lord, all you servants of the Lord, [singers] who by night stand in the house of the Lord.
Lift up your hands in holiness and to the sanctuary and bless the Lord [affectionately and gratefully praise Him]!
The Lord bless you out of Zion, even He Who made heaven and earth.
Psalm 134 Amp
We often pray for God's blessing on people. They may be our family, friends and ourselves. It may be a more general prayer for blessing on our church, workplace, school, neighbourhood, city and nations. And let's not forget God commands us to pray for blessing on people who have wronged us.
Finally, all [of you] should be of one and the same mind (united in spirit), sympathizing [with one another], loving [each other] as brethren [of one household], compassionate and courteous (tenderhearted and humble).
Never return evil for evil or insult for insult (scolding, tongue-lashing, berating), but on the contrary blessing [praying for their welfare, happiness, and protection, and truly pitying and loving them]. For know that to this you have been called, that you may yourselves inherit a blessing [from God—that you may obtain a blessing as heirs, bringing welfare and happiness and protection].
1 Peter 3:8-9 Amp
But how often do we pray asking God how we can be a blessing to Him? I clearly remember a conversation I had with a mature Christian not long after I was saved. We were staying with him and his wife for the weekend. As we were driving to church he was talking about the worship time in the service being a time when we had an opportunity to bless God, rather than a time of asking God to bless us. That conversation started a thought path that continues today, how can I be a blessing to God, not to gain His approval or love, as Jesus has already done that on my behalf. But rather as an act of appreciation and gratitude.
​O GOD, You are my God, earnestly will I seek You; my inner self thirsts for You, my flesh longs and is faint for You, in a dry and weary land where no water is.
So I have looked upon You in the sanctuary to see Your power and Your glory.
Because Your loving-kindness is better than life, my lips shall praise You.
So will I bless You while I live; I will lift up my hands in Your name.
My whole being shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise You with joyful lips
When I remember You upon my bed and meditate on You in the night watches.
For You have been my help, and in the shadow of Your wings will I rejoice.
My whole being follows hard after You and clings closely to You; Your right hand upholds me.
Psalms 63:1-8 Amp
From reading this passage from Psalm 63, we can see some ways we can bless the Lord
1. Earnestly seek Him (don't get distracted by other things and people)
2. Look upon Him ( keep our eyes focused on Him, no matter what is going on)
3. Praise Him (even when you don't feel like it)
4. Lift up my hands (an act of complete surrender to Him and His ways)
5. Remember (remember all that He has done for you, with a grateful heart)
6. Rejoice (in all He has done, is doing and has promised to do)
7. Follow hard (always look to Him purposefully to see where the next step is to be)
8. Cling closely ( as if your life here and for eternity depends upon Him, because it does)
And in desiring to bless the Lord, let's always remember
We love Him, because He first loved us. 
1 John 4:19 Amp
We are abundantly blessed, so today let's seek God on how we can be a blessing to our Him, and the world we live in.
And let us not lose heart and grow weary and faint in acting nobly and doing right, for in due time and at the appointed season we shall reap, if we do not loosen and relax our courage and faint.
So then, as occasion and opportunity open up to us, let us do good [morally] to all people [not onlybeing useful or profitable to them, but also doing what is for their spiritual good and advantage]. Be mindful to be a blessing, especially to those of the household of faith [those who belong to God’s family with you, the believers].Galatians 6:9-10 Amp",2babddf5-5af2-4d6a-ae7b-e170f20bdad9,Blog,2015-09-16T21:20:31Z,"Wendy, A God Girl",Bless (affectionately and gratefully praise) the Lord,1.0,News
1639,"CARDSTON, ALBERTA -- (Marketwired) -- 09/10/15 -- . (TSX VENTURE: AMK) (""American Creek"") (""the Corporation"") is pleased to provide a general corporate update. 

Treaty Creek Litigation 

As previously reported, both the BC Supreme Court and the BC Court of Appeal confirmed American Creek's 51% controlling interest in the Treaty Creek property. The Treaty Creek litigation has now been concluded with Teuton Resources Corp. (""Teuton"") having made the final costs and special costs payments to American Creek. 

The Treaty Creek property is adjacent to Seabridge Gold's KSM property and located in the same region as Pretivm Resources' Brucejack property in northwest British Columbia. 

Allan Burton, CEO, stated the following: ""We are very glad to see the Treaty Creek litigation, and all that it entailed, behind us. We have some great properties and are very much looking forward to getting back to focusing on mineral exploration and exploring all avenues to see those properties reach their full potential."" 

Gold Hill Property 

The Gold Hill property was recently acquired by American Creek (see previous news release dated March 9, 2015). The property is located in the heart of the historic Wildhorse River gold rush area near Fort Steele, BC and holds promise for potentially being an originating source of the historic placer gold. An initial field program involving sampling, mapping and locating the historic adits has begun. Also, the Corporation has received multiple offers to option/JV/purchase the property and is in the process of evaluating those offers. 

In addition to moving the Treaty Creek and Gold Hill projects forward, American Creek intends to prosecute the economic interference / conspiracy / defamation law suit against Teuton, Mr. Cremonese (Teuton's president) and others.

6455,"A Sydney taxi driver found guilty of  repeatedly sexually assaulting a deaf girl as he drove her to and  from her special-needs school is set to be sentenced. 

Osman Chamseddine, 64, was found guilty in May of assaulting the  girl on several occasions in 2009, when she was aged about 10. 

He will be sentenced at Parramatta District Court on Friday. 

The jury rejected Chamseddine's claims that he had never touched  the girl inappropriately and found him guilty of four counts of  aggravated sexual intercourse and two counts of indecent assault. 

The court previously heard the child, now 16, was too frightened  to tell her parents at the time. 

However, she came forward in 2012, telling one of her  hearing-impaired high school friends who then informed a teacher.

3660,"Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi called on the international community on Tuesday to help ensure November polls bring ""genuine political and governmental change"" as campaigning officially kicked-off in the former junta-run country.

Some 30 million people will have the chance to vote -- many for the first time in their lives -- in the elections, the only nationwide polls contested by Suu Kyi's party in a quarter of a century as the nation emerges from decades of stifling military rule.

The veteran democracy activist hailed the November 8 vote as a ""turning point"" for Myanmar, which has been ruled by a quasi-civilian government since the junta loosened its grip on outright power in 2011.

""For the first time in decades, our people will have a real chance of bringing about real change. This is a chance that we cannot afford to let slip,"" she said in an English-language video message released by her National League for Democracy (NLD) party.

Suu Kyi, who was locked up for some 15 years by the junta, urged the international community to monitor the elections and ensure ""our people feel that their will has been respected, and that their will has been respected in the way of genuine political and governmental change"".

In a separate Myanmar-language message, she urged voters to think of future generations as they prepare to cast their ballots, adding that the party believes it can succeed with ""the driving force of people's desire"".

Some 90 political parties are contesting the polls in Myanmar, which is in the throes of a dramatic metamorphosis as reforms sweep investment and opportunity into the long isolated Southeast Asian nation. 

The NLD is fielding over 1,000 candidates for the elections, slightly more than its main rival, the army-backed ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP).

The elections are for seats in the country's legislature, with a president selected by the combined houses of parliament in the months after the vote.

But Suu Kyi herself is ineligible for the top political job because of a rule in the country's junta-drafted constitution that bars those with a foreign spouse or children -- her sons are British.

She has said the party will choose a candidate from within its ranks after the election.

The lack of an obvious heir within the NLD has led to months of fevered speculation that she could throw her support behind the parliament speaker Shwe Mann, who was until recently the head of the USDP. 

He was ousted from his party leadership role in a dramatic late night internal putsch using security forces by President Thein Sein last month, in a move seen as a way for the army and its allies to tighten their grip on the party ahead of the polls.

The USDP won a majority in flawed 2010 elections, which were boycotted by the NLD and held while Suu Kyi was still under house arrest.",2e775af5-204e-4c95-94e1-c176b5eaa19d,News,2015-09-08T02:28:51Z,Yahoo! UK and Ireland,Campaigning begins for historic Myanmar elections,0.0,News

258,"The Dom Post reports : 
 
A Wellington woman tried to explain to a brutal rapist that she could be pregnant with her first child and begged him not to hurt her. 
 
It did not matter to Bailey Meredith, 17, who violated her over and over during an attack on the Hutt River riverbank on June 11 before beating her unconscious. 
 
She had been out walking when he had grabbed her from behind, ordering her to her knees before saying he intended to rape her. 
 
The victim went on to explain about IVF which she and her husband had been going through but it made no difference.  They were to find out if she was pregnant that weekend instead she was being treated for her injuries and tested for sexually transmitted diseases. 
 
Meredith had pleaded guilty to rape, four charges of unlawful sexual connection, abduction with intent to rape, wounding with intent to injure and threatening to kill.  He has been jailed for eight years. 
 
That seems light to me. In 2010 I blogged the Court of Appeal guidelines being : 
  Rape Band 1 (6 to 8 yrs) – offending at the lower end of the spectrum where there are no aggravating factors, no serious violence, no abduction, the victim is not very young or very old.  Rape Band 2 (7 to 13 yrs) – involves moderate violence, pre-meditation, a rape involving more than one offender, or an especially vulnerable victim  Rape Band 3 (12 to 18 yrs) – offending with serious additional violence, wit multiple (three or more) aggravating factors. For particularly cruel, callous or violent rapes.  Rape Band 4 (16 to 20 yrs) – for multiple offending over considerable periods of time, gang or pack rape.   
There was obvious serious violence that left her unconscious.  It would seem to me the case would be Rape Band 2 or 3, not Rape Band 1. 
 
Officer in charge of the investigation, Detective Sergeant Nick Pritchard, said it was one of the worst cases he had investigated. 
 
“This was a sexual attack that involved extreme violence. It was one of the most violent sexual attacks I’ve seen in my career,” he said. 
 
So eight years seems rather light. He did plead guilty which gets 10% to 33% knocked off.  But in theory he could be out of jail in under three years.

4951,"As the transfer window slammed shut last night, we look at top 3 Premier League transfers to watch out for in the seasons ahead.   
Manchester United shocked everyone by completing the signature of French teenage forward Anthony Martial from Monaco for a fee of 50m Euro that could rise up to 80m Euro. 
 
Following the move, Arsenal FC manager Arsene Wenger, who had come under criticism for not signing any outfield player, said that the Martial transfer indicates that there is a genuine shortage of players that can improve the top sides. 
 
However, we pick out top 3 transfers across the Premier League that one can expect to set the league on fire in the coming years and will also be good value for the money. 
 1 – Pedro  
Chelsea FC secured the signature of the pacey FC Barcelona winger under the noses of Manchester United for a fee of £21m. Given some of the other deals that have happened in the window, this looks like an absolute steal. 
 
Pedro had signed a new deal with FC Barcelona, but following the signature of Arda Turan, he felt that his chances might be restricted at the club. While Manchester United were in pole position to sign the Spanish international, Chelsea FC swooped in the 11th hour to sign him. 
 
Pedro is a winger who will create chances and score, as evident from the fact that he has already made two goals and scored one in his two starts for Chelsea FC. 
 
Verdict: 5/5 – The best signing of the transfer window. Chelsea FC have a gem in their rank. 
 
[embedded content] 
 2 – Dimitri Payet  
West Ham signed Payet from Marseille for £10m amidst much fanfare. Payet set up 51 goals over the past six Ligue 1 seasons, having created the most chances of any player across the top 5 leagues. The only thing holding back Payet from signing for a bigger club is his inconsistency. However, at £10m, he is an absolute steal, as is evident from his first few performances. 
 
With the new West Ham stadium on the verge of being ready, the club cannot afford to get relegated. And from his past performances and the first few games in the Hammers shirt, it looks like the London side have made a wise decision to sign the Frenchman. 
 
Verdict: 4/5 – At £10m, the player is a steal. Without a doubt one of the deals of the summer.

3 – Roberto Firmino 
 
Liverpool FC’s capture of the Hoffenheim man was lauded as a coup for the club, especially because they had been missing out on a lot of good players off late. The Brazil international, however, was swooped away by the Merseysiders, that too under the noses of Manchester United and Manchester City , who were both interested in the player. 
 
Liverpool moved quicker and as told by the player, made him feel wanted. 
 
The Brazil man was signed in a £29m deal. Firmino scored 23 goals in his last 66 appearance in the Bundesliga. In the last two years in Germany, he has created the most chances from open play (140) and completed the most dribbles (291). His 10 assists last season was bettered by Kevin de Bruyne in Germany. The Brazilian had 11 assists in the season before last. 
 
Firmino’s talent is there to be seen in the cameos for Liverpool FC so far. He is yet to score a goal or grab an assist, but is slowly building up his fitness and EPL fans got a glimpse of what he could do in the game against West Ham, when a thundering shot from 25 yards from his weaker foot hit the post. 
 
Should he adapt to the league, Liverpool FC have a very good and young player in their ranks who could set the league alight. 
 
Verdict : 3/5 The fee involved is high, but, Firmino is just 23 years of age and should he continue to progress the way he has in the past two years, Liverpool FC have a real player on their hands.

Other mentions:  
 
Since we had to pick only three, Kevin de Bruyne misses out alongside Nicolas Otamendi . Both the players come to Manchester City on the back of tremendous seasons with Wolfsburg and Valencia. While de Bruyne was the Bundesliga Player of the Year and broke the league record for the most assists, Otamendi was the only non-Barcelona or Real Madrid player alongside Atletico Madrid star Antoine Greizmann to make the La Liga Team of the Year. Matteo Darmian , who was the best right-back in the Italian Serie A, as well as Memphis Depay,  who was the Eredivisie top scorer are also great purchases by Manchester United. Petr Cech was hailed by many as a potentially title winning signing, but, we just don’t share the view that he is a major upgrade over Ospina. Besides Darmian, we felt, none of these players, while superb signings in their own right, were as much value for the money as the above three. Darmian may be a bit unlucky to miss out.

855,"It’s Showtime VS. Eat Bulaga!: When is Enough, Enough?— September 22, 2015It’s amusing how #AlDub and #ItsShowtimePastillas are generating millions and millions of tweets in the micro-blogging site, Twitter. But, it’s also kind of frustrating and disturbing how things are turning out in this so-called noontime wars. I may be fascinated by #AlDub, but I am an avid Showtimer. However, It’s Showtime gets borderline desperate to decide on venturing in yet another copy-cat move, also known as the Pastillas serye. In a long list, which I have shared, I showed you the times when It’s Showtime tried to parallel Eat Bulaga!‘s several segments and contests. Although they clicked, this pestering step done by It’s Showtime is obviously a no-brainer, close-to (if not) pathetic take on their share of TV ratings. Yes, they may have, at some point, overpowered the ratings and the noontime slot against EB, but will that ever give them the right and passage to copy and use the other show’s intellectual efforts as their own and eventually, bad mouth the people questioning this deed of theirs? It’s Showtime Mania: Pastillas for Sale #AlDub took fame and the audiences’ lives by storm–all because of a simple, candid accident. EB automatically gained back the noontime clamor because everybody was suddenly in thirst of Yaya Dub and Alden’s dubsmash stints, their notes exchange, the ups-and-downs of their ‘sa tamang panahon’ love story–all of which seamlessly got to be everyone’s lunch time habit. Imagine a daily Pacquiao-fight-like jam-packed TV viewing at home, public terminals, hospitals, schools, and wherever there’s a TV and everybody could watch. EB’s skyrocketing ratings brought by AlDub was obviously a downtime for It’s Showtime. Thus, the push for them to make use of the other YouTube and online media sensations like the infamous Pastillas Girl. I really have nothing against these people wanting to be famous and make a living through TV exposures, but what I am not really in favor of was how It’s Showtime pimping out this Ms. Pastillas on national television while expecting us to empathize, because she was heartbroken, betrayed, back-stabbed, betrayed by her boyfriend and best friend. Yeah, sure, her story is everybody’s story. Yes, probably that empathy soothed other healing hearts and made way for Toper, Jess, and Evan (her tele-suitors) to travel all the way from wherever they’ve been and profess their love (yes, love agad-agad) to Ms. Pastillas. And as I have imagined right from the start, the exes of these kiligserye/Twitterserye would come into place, expose themselves on TV, and add on the story of Ms. Pastillas’ life. But was it really needed, that in order to recover from a losing fight against AlDub mania, It’s Showtime would resort to pimping, selling out Ms. Pastillas and her vulnerability on TV? Was it even politically and morally upright? Yes, they may not be boldly and on-the-spot selling this girl in exchange for sexual delights, but isn’t calling on for male prospects out there to be her Mr. Pastillas a close relation to that? My opinion on this matter is far beyond the mere AlDub-Pastillas wars on who is better or who should be idolized more. I’m only saying that while It’s Showtime may give ‘chances’ or ‘opportunities’ to these people, they might be taking the route of a wrong direction. I am with Vice Ganda’s statements on people taking all these stardom against Ms. Pastillas and that she shouldn’t be bullied just for the plain fact that she wanted to share her life story on TV; but, I am typically against Vice Ganda’s pertinacity on claiming that they weren’t doing any wrong, that there weren’t anyone being at a disadvantage in all this, because in reality there is, there are. It’s a shame and insult for women to be auctioned for everyone to see. What would the younger generation say and think about this–that it’s perfectly okay to sell out themselves to people? How about the feelings and right-to-intellectual-property of the people behind every segment or production that was closely duplicated, of the real author of the ‘pastillas recipe’ who was overseen because fame and limelight was cast upon the girl who used (without permission) the recipe that wasn’t her? Definitely, there is something wrong in this current Pastillas fame. And when there’s someone ill-favored in anything, it should be enough. If you cannot see this, then maybe you should pay a visit to the eye-doctor (or better yet to a mental doctor).   **photo credits to the owners** Share this Post:« Previous ArticleSecond Rate Copycat: War of the Noontime Shows",10092ded-78e3-4c8e-8b49-f8d7191ca4de,Blog,2015-09-22T06:56:33Z,Ely's Planet,"It’s Showtime VS.

Naftogaz of Ukraine will approach Gazprom in the coming several days with a request for discount in terms of the customs duty, Miller said. ""Just as in previous periods, Gazprom will forward proposals to the Russian Government,"" he added. 
 
""The price level will be comparable and competitive with the European Union’s neighbors of Ukraine. Gazprom will refrain from the Take or Pay clause for the next two quarters,"" Miller said. 
 
""European institutions provided financing to Ukraine in the amount of $500 mln to date. This will support the purchase of about 2 bln cubic meters of gas from Gazprom, which is certainly not enough to pass the whole winter period without risks. We will continue working,"" Gazprom CEO said.

The overall value of directors' trades halved this week but some familiar faces returned to the buyers' list. Gordon Merchant, who founded Billabong International more than four decades ago and is now a non-executive director, spent $2.6 million, which was a repeat of what he outlaid a few days earlier.

""Two years into our turnaround Billabong is back to full-year profit,"" chief Neil Fiske remarked when delivering the group's results last month.

He delivered a mixed picture of the group's current-year trading but said the benefits of supply chain and other initiatives would begin in the second half of the year.

Elsewhere, another recent buyer in the form of Gerald Harvey returned to the market.

He and his wife have been hefty buyers of the retailer's scrip recently.

Since its tax-paid earnings result – a 19 per cent improvement excluding property revaluation adjustments – was announced last month, the shares have dropped from $4.52 to as low as $3.78.

They last fetched $3.90.

Elsewhere, one Paul Lennon, a former premier of Tasmania and now chairman of Australian Bauxite, rounded his stake up to 500,000 shares when he spent $66,000.

The group holds 37 bauxite tenements in Queensland, NSW and Tasmania, and not long ago started its first mine at Bald Hill in Tasmania. The group expects cash flow within three months.

About three months ago the shares were fetching 30¢; they last sold at 22¢.

Elsewhere, the overall scorecard registered $10 million to $28 million in favour of sellers.

Taking a little something off the table were a couple of James Hardie directors headed by the chief, Louis Gries.

Gries, a long-term Hardie staffer, got a swag of incentive paper and collected nearly $11 million through on-market sales.

1285,"Metal Gear Solid 5 Quiet bug could corrupt save, Konami warns Konami is investigating the bug, but has not yet found its cause. by GameSpot Staff @gamespot September 7, 2015 10:05 PM PDT Updated: September 8, 2015 10:07 AM PDT Konami has issued a warning to Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain players regarding a bug that could corrupt save files. As explained on the company's website, this bug can be triggered if you have Quiet as a buddy character while playing Mission 29 or Mission 42.
To avoid a potential headache, Konami recommends that you simply do not use Quiet as a buddy during those missions. The bug is affecting all platforms, and a Konami community manager says on Twitter that the company is currently working to determine the cause, after which it can develop a fix.
""We deeply apologize, and appreciate your patience for further announcements regarding this issue,"" Konami said.
We'll update this post with more details as they become available.
Although The Phantom Pain received glowing praise upon release on September 1, the game's launch was marred somewhat by servers issues that lasted days. These problems, which affected the game's Forward Operating Base multiplayer mode, have now been largely fixed. The Phantom Pain will continue to grow next month in the area of multiplayer, as that's when Konami plans to release the game's more traditional, head-to-head multiplayer mode, Metal Gear Online for consoles. This multiplayer offering is coming in January 2016 for PC.
Earlier this year, Konami announced that it had started development on a new Metal Gear Solid game and was actively recruiting for the project. Meanwhile, series creator Hideo Kojima is expected to exit Konami, according to GameSpot's sources.

There are dual ways for pilots to advantage inclination in an aeroplane and weigh a doing qualities. The initial is to stand into a cockpit and takeoff; a second is to use in a ground-based simulator. Each process has advantages and limitations. Now, it is probable to mix a best of both by an sparkling new record famous as Fused Reality that is being tested by researchers from NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center during Edwards, California, and a National Test Pilot School (NTPS) in circuitously Mojave. 
 
The tenure Fused Reality was coined by Ed Bachelder, a system’s contriver and technical executive during Systems Technology, Inc. (STI), Hawthorne, California, when a association began growth in 2003 underneath a Phase we Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) module for Naval Air Systems Command and a US Army. The law record combines genuine universe video with interactive mechanism generated environments to emanate a rarely immersive training knowledge for practicing formidable tasks such as landing, drifting in arrangement with other aircraft, and aerial refueling. While flying, a commander wears a special helmet with an visual complement that combines a genuine out-the-window perspective from a camera with computer-generated graphics of an airfield or another aircraft. 
 
 
Fused Reality displays a practical sourroundings over a corner of a genuine control panel. For aerial refueling use a commander attempts to bond a practical receiver examine into a drogue receptacle extended from a computer-generated tanker. Credits: NASA Photo 
 
In 2012, regulating SBIR funds, researchers from NASA and STI conducted 3 analysis flights on Calspan Corporation’s rarely mutated Learjet in-flight simulator during Mojave. Armstrong investigate pilots Troy Asher and Jim Less felt that nonetheless a Fused Reality complement showed good guarantee for flight-test and training, there were elements that indispensable improvement. Additional efforts, paid for by Armstrong’s Center Innovation Fund, subsequently authorised researchers to scold teenager problems and supplement enhancements. 
 
In a subsequent proviso of flight-testing, commencement in Sep 2014, a group successfully demonstrated an softened Fused Reality complement on house a Gippsland GA-8 Airvan investigate aircraft owned by a NTPS. A array of 9 flights culminated in Jan 2015 with 4 flown by Armstrong investigate pilots Tim Williams, Dave Fedors, Scott Howe, and Wayne Ringelberg. Each commander achieved a array of tasks generated by a Fused Reality complement and subjectively rated a airplane’s doing qualities. These tasks enclosed alighting on a unnatural runway during altitude, arrangement flight, and aerial refueling drogue tracking. 
 
Although many ground-based moody simulators embody full-motion capabilities to imitate what it feels like to be in a genuine aircraft, they miss some of a cues that come with that experience. Fused Reality provides a some-more picturesque knowledge since a aircraft is genuine and customarily some outmost elements are virtual. Scott Howe was utterly tender with his knowledge drifting arrangement with a unnatural KC-135.

“I’m saying a genuine universe by my camera, so I’m saying plateau and clouds and a aircraft control panel, though I’m drifting arrangement with a practical tanker,” he said. “I was only perplexing to keep hire with that tanker and use aerial refueling with a [Fused Reality] system.” 
 
Significantly, a analysis pilots remarkable that this complement did not meddle in any approach with receiving tangible doing qualities of a aircraft. 
 
“I consider what we advantage here,” pronounced Howe, “is a advantage of holding a simulator into a air, where we are unprotected to a tangible drifting environment, though with a ability to superimpose a picturesque make-believe on tip of it.” 
 
For exam pilots, Fused Reality can be used to rise doing qualities analysis tasks for rating several aircraft configurations, modernized moody control law algorithms, commander displays and aircraft modifications. The complement can also be used to sight exam pilots how to do these evaluations. 
 
The subsequent proviso of contrast will be integrated into a curriculum of a Air Force Test Pilot School’s Test Management Program in Mar 2016. Student exam pilots will pattern and govern a moody exam module regulating a school’s C-12 (Beechcraft King Air), and review ratings of required doing qualities tasks with formula acquired regulating a Fused Reality system.

“Fused Reality allows all pilots to learn how to fly formidable and dangerous tasks such as aerial refueling, aircraft conduit landing, arrangement moody and aerial firefighting, that are customarily taught in a belligerent formed moody simulator, by putting a simulator in moody in a tangible aircraft,” pronounced Armstrong plan manager Bruce Cogan. “Virtual images of runways, aircraft carriers, and tanker aircraft are presented to a commander in a helmet mounted arrangement that reacts with a tangible dynamics of a aircraft being flown.” 
 
Cogan also remarkable that a Navy is questioning a use of Fused Reality for aircraft conduit alighting training, and that NASA is looking into intensity use of a complement to raise wanderer training.

""As with our rankings of national college and universities, when ranking regional universities it made sense to us to consider which factors the largest survey of actual college freshmen said was most important to them when they chose their school,"" said Jeremy Alder 

The ranking takes into account academic reputation, average amount of scholarship and grant aid per student, overall net cost, and the average starting salary for graduates. Each factor was weighted equally. Data was derived from several publicly available sources, including the National Center for Education Statistics, Payscale.com, and U.S. News & World Report.

College Choice is an independent online publication dedicated to helping students and their families find the right college. The site publishes rankings and reviews that make finding the best colleges for different interests easier and more fun, as well as resources to help students get into, pay for, and thrive at the college of their choice.

1476,"By RAY BENTON
Leader sports editor This Friday marks the halfway point of the football season, and presents some interesting matchups and a couple of likely blowouts. One of the more interesting games is Beebe at Jacksonville. It’s homecoming week for the Red Devils and they welcome the limping Badgers to Jan Crow Stadium. A wounded Badger is a dangerous one, however, and the Beebe Badgers are fighting for their playoff lives despite it just being the second conference game of the season. Beebe enters this week’s game with as many as four, and at least three offensive starters out, as well as two defensive starters. Only 34 players were dressed out for practice on Monday for Beebe. Jacksonville will only be missing one player, and has a lot more depth than Beebe, at least in regards to total number of players. The Red Devils still had almost as many players left at practice after the junior varsity team left for a game at PA on Monday, as the Badgershave dressing out for practice. Despite the compounded problems of low numbers, several injuries and three-straight losses, Beebe went to work on Monday with focus. The Badgers always break up into individual groups every Monday, and the majority of that time was spent on defense this Monday. Jacksonville has given a few different looks on offense and Beebe head coach John Shannon wants the team prepared for all of it. Beebe was picked as high as third in preseason and second in the conference. But after losing 14-13 to McClellan, the Badgers need to beat Jacksonville to avoid any playoff hopes at all from sliding further away. With only seven teams in the conference this year, due to the elimination of the North Pulaski program, it will likely only take three conference wins to make the playoffs. A Beebe loss, however, means needing to win three of the last four, with two currently undefeated teams still left on the schedule. SH VS. FAIR
The other conference matchup involving a local team is Sylvan Hills (4-0) hosting J.A. Fair (0-4). The Bears are averaging 55 points per game while the War Eagles have scored two offensive touchdowns all season. That’s about all anyone needs to know about this matchup. CABOT VS. MARION
The Class 7A Cabot Panthers play an utterly meaningless conference game against Class 6A Marion at home on Friday. Marion (3-1) appears to be improving under second-year coach Jed Davis. The Patriots won just one game last year after switching from longtime coach Mark Uhiren’s Diamond-T to the Spread, but have tripled that win total in four games this year. The Panthers had a mercy rule at halftime last year. That probably won’t happen this season, but Cabot (4-0) is still a heavy favorite. While the Panthers may not race out to a 42-0 lead, if they take care of the football, the final score could be very similar to last year’s 42-6. Sans J.A. Fair, Cabot’s competition level has been much better than Marion’s. The Patriots started 3-0 with three-point wins over Wynne and Blytheville, and a 20-point win over Nettleton, all three of the 5A-East. Last week, the Patriots played a struggling West Memphis team and lost 34-21, even though the Blue Devils had only beaten Wynne by one and had lost to Blytheville. While Cabot quarterback Jarrod Barnes got most of the headlines for the several big plays the offense busted in its 34-3 win over North Little Rock, the Panther defense was the key to that victory. In three first-half trips into the red zone, the Wildcats managed just three points. When a defensive touchdown early in the third quarter put the Wildcats down 27-3, they had to largely abandon the run game, and the Cabot secondary was stellar in coverage the rest of the way. If the defense continues to play that well, and the offense can avoid the fumbles that have plagued it all season long, this game won’t stay close much past halftime either. LONOKE VS. NEWPORT
The Lonoke Jackrabbits are coming off a terribly disappointing loss to Heber Springs while Newport enters the game riding a season-long wave of disappointment. Injuries are a big reason for Lonoke’s letdown. The Greyhounds, however, were picked by many to win the 4A-2 Conference, and that goal is still attainable. But the 0-4 Hounds have barely been competitive in three of their losses, and dropped their league opener at home to Helena-West Helena Central last week, 25-14. Newport was also upset by HWHC in the conference opener last season, and didn’t lose again until the playoffs, winning six-straight, starting with a 34-12 victory over the Jackrabbits. Lonoke was riding high after opening the season with back-to-back upset victories over Star City and Beebe. It then lost a hard-fought game to McClellan, but still carried a lot of confidence into the league opener, which it lost 20-19. The Jackrabbits started that game without their biggest threat on offense in senior speedster Justin Meadows, who suffered a shoulder injury against McClellan. During the game, the Jackrabbits also lost their quarterback and two-way starter Logan Dozier. It’s uncertain how long those players will be out, or if they will miss this week’s homecoming game. If the Jackrabbits are at full strength, they’ll be favored against the struggling Greyhounds. CARLISLE AT MARVELL
Carlisle also lost last week, but looks like it took a big step forward in battling Des Arc to the wire. The Bison won’t be able to gauge improvement much this week. They face Marvell, who, like Sylvan Hills’ opponent, has been one of the worst programs in the state the last several years. Like Fair, the Mustangs have scored exactly 26 points all season, and have given up 200 points in four games. The only thing that could cause Carlisle any trouble this week is the temptation to look ahead to next week’s game against archrival Hazen.",8082bc84-694f-4e19-a769-ac641bc6d71d,Blog,2015-09-29T23:32:09Z,THE ARKANSAS LEADER,SPORTS STORY>>Toss-ups and mismatches in week five,1.0,News

2859,"The DYMO XTL 300 and 500 label makers are fully outfitted with an array of time saving features all designed to make complex labeling jobs simple. Both the XTL 300 and 500 label makers are equipped with a life-like on-screen print preview, the first of its kind on a DYMO labeler, that showcases exactly how labels will look when applied to cables, pipes, patch panels and more. Additionally, hundreds of pre-loaded label templates further simplify the often-complex industrial labeling process by saving time and helping to eliminate mistakes. 
 
As part of the product research and development, DYMO, a Newell Rubbermaid Inc., brand, provided professionals in the datacom, electrical, and maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) fields with the DYMO XTL 300 and 500 label makers (respectively) and asked them to replace their current labeler with a DYMO XTL label maker for a period of eight weeks.Â  At the end of the two-month trial period, DYMO asked the users to rate their experience. The results were astounding with 86 percent of datacom and 79 percent of MRO users stating the XTL label maker performed better than their current labeler. 
 
""The launch of the DYMO XTL label makers is one of the most important Newell Rubbermaid product launches of the year,"" said Marta Aebischer , director of brand marketing. ""We've done the research; we know there's a huge demand for this product. We have spoken to datacom, electrical and MRO professionals and are very confident the DYMO XTL series will become the labeler of choice for these industry professionals."" 
 
The DYMO XTL 300 label maker is an industrial labeler outfitted with multiple time-saving features all designed to help simplify labeling. Built specifically for professionals in the datacom and electrical fields, it comes standard with a life-like on-screen print preview and color display to show exactly how labels will look after printing. The built-in label applications and pre-loaded label templates ensure perfect formatting to help industry professionals save time by expediting the label-making process. 
 
The rechargeable DYMO XTL 300 label maker is built tough with impact-resistant bumpers and a wipe-clean keypad that prints labels from Â¼"" (6 mm) up to 1"" (24 mm) in a full range of UL-rated materials and colors. It features PC connectivity* and DYMO ID software for importing MicrosoftÂ® ExcelÂ® and other database files for entire label batches. 
 
The DYMO XTL 500 label maker is engineered to simplify the labeling process and end common frustrations often associated with creating complex labels to meet industry codes and standards. Like the XTL 300 label maker, the DYMO XTL 500 label maker features a life-like on-screen print preview, built-in label applications and a variety of pre-loaded templates, but adds a color touch screen to make positioning text, barcodes and images on labels faster.

705,"688 Today's Prime Time Devo comes from 2Sa 22:42 They looked, but there was none to save; Even to the LORD, but He did not answer them.” Wow! What a chilling thought. The enemies of David were up against it and in a last ditch effort they even called out to the Lord to save them, but He did not answer them. Kind of makes you wonder, “is there a point of no return?” Can we reach a point of rejecting God, that He stops His ears to our pleas? I think it best that we let Him answer that question. He alone knows our heart. But to call on the Lord in emergency situations without repentance or an intent to follow Him is empty and He sees right through it. It's not that He hasn't tried to reach us. Listen to Prov 1:20-33, “Wisdom calls aloud outside; She raises her voice in the open squares. 21 She cries out in the chief concourses, At the openings of the gates in the city She speaks her words: (God's wisdom calls to us everywhere!) 22 ""How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity? For scorners delight in their scorning, And fools hate knowledge. 23 Turn at my rebuke; (Don't just receive God's rebuke, TURN because of it!) Surely I will pour out my spirit on you; I will make my words known to you. 24 Because I have called and you refused, I have stretched out my hand and no one regarded, 25 Because you disdained all my counsel, And would have none of my rebuke, (It's not like God hasn't been trying!) 26 I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your terror comes, 27 When your terror comes like a storm, And your destruction comes like a whirlwind, When distress and anguish come upon you. 28 ""Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me. 29 Because they hated knowledge And did not choose the fear of the LORD, (We have a choice!) 30 They would have none of my counsel And despised my every rebuke. (Every attempt to turn us toward Him) 31 Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their own way, And be filled to the full with their own fancies. 32 For the turning away of the simple will slay them, And the complacency of fools will destroy them; (That's a lot of bad news, now hear the good in v33, “ But WHOEVER listens to me will dwell safely, And will be secure, without fear of evil.""Stop wondering if God hears you. He just asks that WE LISTEN to HIM! He will do the rest! And the proof of our listening is found in our turning.! There are two types of people in this world, those who turn toward God and those who don't. Maybe God is calling you to turn today! 2Co 6:2b says, “ behold, now is the day of salvation.",aca59eae-c42e-40a8-b5fe-1c9d7a699725,Blog,2015-09-29T11:08:53Z,Prime Time Devo,It's Not Like He Doesn't Try To Reach Us,1.0,News

9,"Tony Abbott's last word  
Watch the last press conference of outgoing Prime Minister Tony Abbott in full. 
 PT6M11S   620  349    

They're the power couple who have run the Liberal Party back-room operation since December 2009. 

But Tony Abbott's ousting as prime minister will inevitably lead to his high-profile chief of staff, Peta Credlin, quitting the blue carpet in Parliament House's ministerial wing.

What will happen to her husband, long-serving Liberal Party federal director Brian Loughnane, is less clear. 
 
Ms Credlin worked for Malcolm Turnbull during his stint as opposition leader in 2008-09, but the pair did not always see eye to eye and she will not be working for the incoming leader. 

After her time with Mr Turnbull, Ms Credlin became the dominant figure in the Abbott government, described as a controlling co-prime minister by her critics, lauded by her allies — not least Mr Abbott, who called her the ""fiercest political warrior I've ever worked with"".  As chief of staff, she became one of the most high-profile staffers in recent political history. 
 
From the first days of the Abbott opposition in December 2009, Peta Credlin was in the room as one of his most trusted lieutenants. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen  
  
From the first days of the Abbott opposition in December 2009, Ms Credlin was in the room as one of the opposition leader's most trusted lieutenants alongside press secretaries and advisers Andrew Hirst and Claire Kimball, honing and refining Mr Abbott's laser-like attack on Kevin Rudd's carbon pollution reduction scheme. 

After just less than four years in opposition,  in September 2013, Ms Credlin, a lawyer with years of experience in the Howard government, made the transition as chief of staff into government. 

But the tightly controlled approach adopted in opposition did not work as smoothly in government.

Public complaints about a "" command and control "" approach taken by the prime minister's office quickly surfaced, and a reliance on slogans that worked in opposition did not cut through in government. 

In February 2015, when Mr Abbott faced a spill motion in the party room, some MPs were calling for a shake-up of the prime minister's office, and for political veteran Tony Nutt to be brought into the office. 

Ms Credlin disappeared from public view, for a time, but the complaints soon resurfaced. 
 
Brian Loughnane has been federal director of the Liberal Party since 2003. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen  
  
But Mr Abbott refused suggestions of change to his office: in his farewell speech, he singled out his chief of staff  ""who has been unfairly maligned by people who should've known better"". 

And now, both exit the political centre stage, at least for a time. 

Mr Loughnane, meanwhile, has been federal director of the Liberal Party since February 2003 and party strategists told Fairfax Media on Tuesday that, if possible, he should continue in the role. 

One veteran pointed out that Mr Turnbull and Mr Loughnane had worked together before, during Mr Turnbull's stint as opposition leader, and that a change in director was not ""necessary or inevitable"". 

That veteran also said the prime minister's office would likely benefit from a bit of ""competitive tension"" between it and Liberal Party HQ. 

""It depends on the relationship between the two of them; [Mr Loughnane] has served every leader since Howard.      But Malcolm will have to be comfortable with the director – you can't have a situation like [former prime minister] Paul Keating and [former ALP secretary] Gary Gray [in 1996]."" 

A second Liberal veteran said Ms Credlin was ""very talented and a good manager, but it will be hard for her to stay in the show. I do hope Brian stays on. The most important thing is corporate knowledge and experience."" 

Fairfax Media sought comment from Ms Credlin and Mr Loughnane. 

On Tuesday, Mr Turnbull also began the process of putting together his office team. 

The former secretary of the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism, and of the Communications Department, Drew Clarke, will serve as his acting chief of staff, while Mr Nutt, who worked closely with Turnbull backer Senator Arthur Sinodinos in the office of John Howard, will return to Canberra to help manage the transition to the prime ministership. 

Senator Sinodinos confirmed on Tuesday that Mr Turnbull would seek to emulate the attitude of Mr Howard as prime minister by taking a team approach, ""and have a number of senior people in there who can provide advice and make sure it's an open prime minister's office, it's accessible and that there are tributaries of advice going to the prime minister,"" he told Sky News. 

""The role of the office is not to be a gatekeeper and cut people off; the role of the office has to be a facilitator of contact so the prime minister knows and has early warning of whether there are concerns. 

""You don't need the polls if you have backbenchers who are frank and willing to tell you what is going on.""

3262,"What Is 'Public' Education? - Bridging Differences - Education Week: What Is 'Public' Education? 
Dear Harry and friends,
It's good to get back to a schedule with deadlines.  After a lifetime of deadlines this retirement life is sometimes harder to enjoy than it ought to be. 
Harry Boyte is a very old friend, although not as old as I am.  We've always been sort of on the same page but coming to it from different dispositions, life experiences and ways of seeing the world.   As a result I often turn to him when I'm perplexed and worried for the possibility that he can come up with a way of looking at the issues that gives me a new thread to pull at.
Our basic commitment to democracy has posed problems for us both, as you will discover.  We've ""played"" with it in different venues and settings, with occasional shared ones.  That helps.   Harry has managed to make life even more difficult for himself (and helpful to me) by having a longstanding and personal commitment to the saga of South Africa.
But we're going to tackle the complexity of the idea itself--as a way of living as well as a way of governing, and in the process we hope to help our friends and allies reexamine their positions around public schooling so that, at the very least, we are all on something closer to the same side than we often are now.  How can we define public in a democracy in such a way that it helps us separate the efforts to privatize education and the efforts to figure out how to more successfully provide an education for democracy for all of us? 
Lucky are those who can go to a free public school, close to home, where they can feel confident that their child is in good hands, with people you can trust, and with people who will take your concerns seriously and respectfully.   How to give professionals the respect and autonomy they want while you, their family, doesn't have any reason to fear that their autonomy will be used against their children's and their own best interests?  While also...still another hitch--expecting the larger public to pay the bill.  
Even families who have the means and desire to pay for  private school make compromises--but they have choices when and if the compromises become intolerable.  What about the rest of us?  Is choice an answer?  Or does it simply lead to pretending that an unequal market place is equally good for rich ad poor, white and black, atheists and the devoutly religious?   Of course, Harry, we may not end up covering all this, since as we go along we may discover many interesting bypaths--like when is representative democracy best vs direct?  Who should be ""included""--the custodian, the cook?  Which tax payers?    And on and on.....
Dear Deb and colleagues,
I have always greatly appreciated your passion for democracy as the most important end of education, as well as your  deep respect for teachers' roles, and your view of education as a living, relational, consequential activity that should ""liberate the powers"" of each student, in Dewey's phrase.
We also have differences on what is ""public"" education and what erodes it. My story helps to explain.
I was shaped as a young white southerner in the 1960s by my family's involvement in the ""civil rights"" movement. I also agree with Martin Luther King's friend Vincent Harding, who said in Hope and History, ""civil rights movement is too narrow a description...in fact [the movement] was a What Is 'Public' Education? - Bridging Differences - Education Week:",518c2cb5-bdb4-4021-b873-3cad6965c022,Blog,2015-09-22T15:10:16Z,Big Education Ape,What Is 'Public' Education? - Bridging Differences - Education Week,1.0,Blog
3812,"Harry Kane 
HARRY KANE was quick to praise the efforts of his Tottenham Hotspur team-mates after the striker finally ended his goal drought by scoring in Saturday’s stunning 4-1 Premier League triumph at home to Manchester City. 
 
Despite scoring twice for England, Kane had failed to find the net in seven previous appearances for Spurs this season – but the reigning Professional Footballers’ Association young player of the year put that right by grabbing the third goal in a remarkable victory which resulted in City being knocked off the top of the table. 

The visitors actually took the lead through Kevin de Bruyne, but Eric Dier got Tottenham back on level terms prior to the interval – with the goal being allowed to stand despite a clear offside in the build-up – and second-half strikes from Toby Alderweireld, Kane and Erik Lamela wrapped up the points. 

The win means that Spurs have not lost in the league since defeat at new leaders Manchester United on the opening day of the season, and Kane is delighted with the way that the team is progressing. 

“It was an incredible performance as a team,” he said. “Everyone was focused on what they had to do, and we put in a real statement of a performance. 

“Eric scored a very important goal on the stroke of half-time, and what a goal it was. We said at half-time to go out and bring a lot of energy and bring the momentum of that goal with us. 

“We got the early goal in the second half and took it from there. We never looked like conceding after that. The defence was great and everyone put in a shift. 

“City were top of the league at the start of play and we showed what we’re capable of. We’ve got a young team, a very energetic team and we’re excited. We’re enjoying every moment and days like this will give us even more confidence.” 

And Kane also hopes that his goal will help to silence some of the critics who had began to question whether the striker would be able to live up to his exploits of last season – when he scored 31 goals in all competitions. 

“Maybe I shut up a few people who have been talking over the past few weeks,” he added. “Only seven games have gone and a few people called me a one-season wonder. People can judge me at the end of the season and we will go from there. 

“I have to stay focused but it was great to score. When you score like I did last season it becomes a drug and when someone takes it away from you then you want to get it back. You want to score again and it was a good feeling to score again. 

“It is frustrating to be criticised. I kind of use it to get my juices flowing and to prove these people wrong. I have had to prove people wrong throughout my career to get where I am.”",f8ba6515-eb48-4005-9ae0-a03776c6b449,News,2015-09-30T23:43:13Z,Hendon Today,Kane’s joy at win against City,0.0,News

1057,"The Senate Spokesperson, Senator Dino Melaye, has on Wednesday disclosed that the senate is yet to receive President Muhammadu Buhari’s ministerial list as deadline looms. 
 
“We are still waiting for the ministerial list from the President. I want to advise that there is no need for agitation because September expires by midnight and the office of the Senate President is open, “ Melaye said. 
 
Meanwhile, reports from New York, where Buhari has been attending the UN General Assembly, quoted the president as saying he would be minister of petroleum resources, with a junior minister taking charge of day-to-day affairs in the sector. 
 
“Confirmed. He said so,” his spokesman Femi Adesina told AFP in a text message, without giving further details. 
 
Buhari’s caution in appointing ministers has seen him nicknamed “Baba Go Slow” in Nigeria, but he has promised to name his cabinet by Wednesday, Sept 30, 2015.

1327,"Pollution, as scandals on both sides of the Atlantic show, is a physical manifestation of corruption. By George Monbiot, published in the Guardian 23 September 2015 In London, the latest figures suggest, it now kills more people than smoking. Worldwide, a new study estimates, it causes more deaths than malaria and HIV-Aids together. I’m talking about the neglected health crisis of this age, that we seldom discuss or even acknowledge. Air pollution. Heart attacks, strokes, asthma, lung and bladder cancers, low birth weight, low verbal IQ, poor memory and attention among children, faster cognitive decline in older people and – recent studies suggest – a link with the earlier onset of dementia: all these are among the impacts of a problem that, many still believe, we solved decades ago. The smokestacks may have moved to China, but other sources, whose fumes are less visible, have taken their place. Among the worst are diesel engines, sold, even today, as the eco-friendly option, on the grounds that their greenhouse gas emissions tend to be lower than those of petrol engines. You begin to wonder whether any such claims can still be trusted. Volkswagen’s rigging of its pollution tests is an assault on our lungs, our hearts, our brains. It is a classic example of externalisation: the dumping of costs that businesses should carry onto other people. The air that should have been filtered by its engines is filtered by our lungs instead. We have become the scrubbing devices it failed to install. Who knows how many people have paid for this crime already, with their health or with their lives? In the USA, 200,000 deaths a year are attributed to air pollution. For how many of those might Volkswagen be responsible? Where else was the fraud perpetrated? Of what proportion of our health budgets has this company robbed us? The fraud involves the detection of nitrous oxides (NOx), of which diesel engines are the major source in many places. This month, for the first time in our history, the UK government estimated the impact of NOx emissions on public health, and discovered that they are likely almost to double the number of deaths from air pollution, adding 23,000 to the 29,000 attributed to particulates (tiny particles of soot). The government released this discovery, alongside its useless proposals for dealing with the problem, on Saturday 12 September, a few minutes before Jeremy Corbyn’s election as Labour leader was announced. How many government press releases are published on a Saturday? How many are published on a Saturday during an event on which everyone is focused? In other words, as a Labour press officer once notoriously advised, this was “a good day to bury bad news”. Not only was the number of deaths buried by this means, but so was the government’s consultation on its feeble plans for reducing this pollution: a consultation to which it evidently wanted as few respondents as possible. Liz Truss, the environment secretary, has some explaining to do. She has her reasons for keeping us in the dark. In April, the Supreme Court ruled that the UK is in breach of the European air quality directive, and insisted that the government draw up a plan for compliance by the end of this year. Instead, Truss produced a plan to shed responsibility. Local authorities, her consultation suggests, should create clean air zones in at least eight cities, in which diesel engines are restricted or banned. But she has given them neither new money nor new powers. Nor has she offered an explanation of how this non-plan is going to address the issue in the rest of the country, as the ruling demands. Already, the UK has missed the European deadline by six years. Under Truss’s proposals, some places are likely still to be in breach by 2025: 16 years after the original deadline. I urge you to respond to the consultation she wanted you to miss, which closes on November 6. The only concrete plan the government has produced so far is to intensify the problem, through a new programme of airport expansion. This means more nitrous oxides, more particulates, more greenhouse gas emissions. Paradoxically, the Volkswagen scandal may succeed where all else has failed, by obliging the government to take the only action that will make a difference: legislating for a great reduction in the use of diesel engines. By the time this article is published, we might know whether the company’s scam has been perpetrated in Europe as well as North America: new revelations are dripping by the hour. But whether or not this particular deception was deployed here, plenty of others have been. Last week the Guardian reported that nine out of ten new diesel cars break European limits on nitrous oxides – not by a little but by an average of sevenfold. Every manufacturer whose emissions were tested had cars in breach of the legal limit. They used a number of tricks to hotwire the tests: “stripping components from the car to reduce weight, using special lubricants, over-inflating tyres and using super-smooth test tracks.” In other words, the emissions scandal is not confined to Volkswagen, not confined to a single algorithm and not confined to North America: it looks, in all its clever variants, like a compound global swindle. There are echoes here of the ploys used by the tobacco industry: grand deceptions smuggled past the public with the help of sophisticated marketing. Volkswagen sites advertising the virtues of “clean diesel” have been dropping offline all day. In 2009, the year in which its scam began, the TDI engine at the centre of the scandal won the Volkswagen Jetta 2.0 the green car of the year award. In 2010, it did the same for the Audi A3. There’s plenty that’s wrong with corporate regulation in the United States, but at least the fines, when they occur, are big enough to make a corporation pause, and there’s a possibility of guilty executives ending up in prison. Here, where corruption, like pollution, is both omnipresent and invisible, major corporations can commit almost any white-collar crime and get away with it. Schemes of the kind that have scandalised America are, in this country, both commonplace and unremarked. How can such governments be trusted to defend our health? www.monbiot.com  ",74d0eff8-4798-48eb-a1e9-9ab17e29f195,Blog,2015-09-22T20:13:35Z,George Monbiot,Smoke and Mirrors,1.0,News
1150,"-  While exhibiting at the ION GNSS+ 2015 Conference in Tampa, Florida, the InLocation Alliance (ILA) today announced the publications of two new white papers from the group's Use Case Working Group. These white papers provide insight to Retail Industry and Transportation Industry thought leaders of the opportunities afforded by indoor location based services and technical solutions being developed by the InLocation Alliance members. These technical solutions utilize the ILA developed technology-agnostic System Architecture which provides interoperability for ILA member developed use cases. 
 
An earlier InLocation Alliance member survey indicated Retail and Marketing at the top of their efforts to reap benefits in the short/medium horizon. The results are confirmed by the wealth of announcements or products, trials, and deployment that are unceasingly being published. 
 
The Indoor Location Based Services in Retail and Marketing White Paper illustrates the opportunities to retailers by describing some exemplary developments and deployments in retail and marketing while highlighting the importance of the ILA -- a catalyst for open innovation. 
 
The Indoor Location Based Services in Transportation Hubs White Paper shows that the transportation sector is investing in and expecting significant innovation from indoor Location Based Services (LBS). Earlier this year, ILA recognized three leading innovations in LBS applications, two of which were related to the transportation sector. 
 
""LBS capabilities in transportation hubs offer significant benefits to the operation of the facility, employees, vendors and passengers, creating a classic 'win-win' scenario for all the involved parties,"" said Jouni Kämäräinen, Chair of ILA. ""The transportation focused White Paper addresses the growing value of indoor LBS, several specific applications and their value proposition, and the role of the ILA in accelerating the adoption of these capabilities."" 
 
""Although many notable examples of deployments in the retail and the transportation industry are already available, with some being reported here, the ILA believes that the time has come for a more extensive activity that will allow a deeper integration of the indoor location technologies in the business processes of both the retail industry and the transportation industry, to the benefit of all involved stakeholders,"" said Fabio Malabocchia, Use Case Working Group Chair for ILA. 
 
Industry organizations and alliances as well as innovative companies in the Retail industry and in the transportation industry are invited to contact the ILA and cooperate with the alliance to fulfill this intent.

Feedzai also announced updates to its software platform that provide improved risk management and fraud prevention solutions. Its powerful machine learning software is now being used for a variety of financial applications beyond transaction authorization, such as new account opening and loss prevention. 

""Financial organizations today face many risks that were not present even a few years ago, like 'card not present' fraud and the large number of consumers who are creditworthy but credit history -poor,"" said Nuno Sebastiao , co-founder and CEO of Feedzai. ""At the same time, there is an enormous amount of data that these organizations can use, not only to provide better experiences for their customers and prospects, but to differentiate themselves in the marketplace as well. Over the last year, we've fine tuned our machine learning platform to help organizations manage risks and rationalize data output from various internal systems."" 

With the Socure partnership, online and social data becomes another source of data that Feedzai's software uses to detect fraud and minimize risks. Additional data sources used by Feedzai include session clickstream, access frequency, and malware signatures, among others. Feedzai's Fraud Prevention That Learns™ platform is now being used in the following cases outside of transaction authorization: 
Merchant Signup : Verifies, underwrites and monitors merchants against collusion and insolvency.  Account Opening : Works to onboard and verify new account applications and ""thin-file"" applications.  Chargeback Management : Prevents payment chargeback reversals, disputes, penalty fees or merchandise loss due to fraudulent sales.  Information Services : Performs advanced data visualization through its analytics platform.  Loss Prevention : Monitors internal processes and external data sources to protect against data exfiltration and employee collusion. 
""The transaction fraud protection Feedzai provides for financial institutions is best of breed for the industry,"" said Sunil Madhu , co-founder and CEO of Socure. ""Social Biometrics from Socure is the perfect complement, making it even more powerful.  The power of the joint solution from Socure and Feedzai is the biggest innovation to the B2C identity lifecycle for some time to come,"" he added. 
 
As instances of credit card fraud, identity theft, and related risks to financial payments systems continue to grow, the danger for private citizens, banks and other institutions takes an increasingly costly toll. Socure works to protect them by leveraging its patented Social Biometrics technology--at the cutting edge of analytics, machine learning, facial recognition and artificial intelligence. 

Feedzai Fraud Prevention That Learns™ technology fuses big data and machine learning to allow analysts to distinguish normal from abnormal behaviors, which can predict and prevent losses in real-time. The software uses complex event processing to aggregate and process high-volume streams of big data, including mobile and social data streams, to create deep learning profiles for each customer, merchant, location or POS device, product, with up to a three-year history of data behind it. This analysis and process helps acquirers, issuers, and retailers mitigate risk, guard every transaction, and preserve the customer experience.

The journalist and vintage fanatic on Thursday night held a cocktail with retailer Matchesfashion.com during Milan Fashion Week to mark the launch of a collection of dresses made with Italian manufacturer Mantero Silk.
For her first outing under the label LaDoubleJ Editions, she opted for a short-sleeved A-line style that hits just above the ankle, available in eight archival patterns dating from the 1910s to the Eighties.
“I’m a big maximalist. I love print, I love pattern, but I think you kind of need it in really simple lines,” said Martin, sporting one of her own creations in a bold pattern called Confetti.
“Basically, what we wanted to do was create the easiest, most fail-safe silhouette that literally looks good on every woman, and you’ll have no problems with those areas that every woman is concerned about: the hips, the butt, the stomach. You can have as much dinner as you want, you still fit in the dress,” she added.
Available exclusively on her Web site, LaDoubleJ.com, and Matchesfashion.com, the dresses retail for $480. Further collections are already in the works.

6165,"The staggering sum includes £27 million to motorists to repair vehicles and cover injury claims and £13 million in property claims Around £77 million worth of insurance claims are being paid out every day, industry figures show.

The Association of British Insurers (ABI), which released the findings, said they showed how the industry was helping households and businesses to cope with unexpected events, from motor, property, travel and pet insurance policies to income protection and critical illness cover.

Insurers pay out nearly £8.2 million in domestic claims a day to repair homes and replace contents, but despite an average combined buildings and contents policy costing just £24 a month, one in five UK households (24%) do not have contents insurance, the ABI said.

Meanwhile, only one in four (24%) UK households has life insurance, yet protection insurers pay out around £9 million every day in financial support to families to help them cope with illness, injury or death.

Huw Evans, ABI director general said the insurance and long-term savings industry played a crucial role to help families and businesses through the financial challenges of life.

He continued: ""However, there is some work to be done to build confidence in products, tackle under-insurance and help more people understand the value of protecting themselves.""

The £77 million-a-day payout by insurers includes: :: £27 million to motorists to repair vehicles and cover injury claims £13 million in property claims, of which £8.2 million goes to home owners, and £4.7 million goes to business owners for commercial claims £9 million from protection policies, such as critical illness, income protection and life insurance, to help people cope with financial strains that can arise following a death or serious illness £9 million to business customers in commercial liability claims, such as employers' liability £9 million in accident and health claims £7 million to help private health insurance customers receive medical treatment £1.6 million to pay for medical treatment for pets

7030,"Too many entrepreneurs treat marketing like an expense.  This is simply not true.  Marketing isn’t a monthly bill with no return; it is not some sort of upfront cost like keeping the lights on or keeping the cupboard stocked with coffee. 
 
Marketing, in it’s truest form, is an investment.  Like any investment, it will require some funding to take off. Simply put: you put money in, you wait, and your business increases due to that investment. 
 
Marketing is a crucial part of any entrepreneurial venture. But if done poorly marketing can do more harm than good.  If done effectively, marketing will pay out dividends. So how can you stretch your marketing budgets further and ensure that it is working for you? Well, it’s the little things. 
  Take advantage of free publicity: Look for opportunities to be active in community activities. Leverage your experience and connect with local organizations for a chance to speak at their meetings. This gives your business’s brand invaluable face time with people from a variety of industries. Additionally, you should look into writing: be it for an industry magazine or as simple as your own blog. Positioning yourself as a wealth of knowledge in your field gives your marketing credibility, stretching those efforts further.  Share your brand: People do business with other people. Never forget that. So get out there and consistently network. Who is better equipped to tell your business’s story other than you? Networking can serve a multitude of purposes, from gaining sales leads to spreading your brand.  It gives a face and a name to your brand, and allows you to ensure your story is told accurately and well.  Maintain your relationships: Focus on your existing clients as well the prospective ones. Ensure that your customer base is taken care of. Often times this goes beyond a simple follow-up. If they are not satisfied, figure out why and do everything you can to fix it. A great client referral is the best marketing you can ask for, but a bad review is blood in the water for your marketing efforts.   
Marketing is a necessity for entrepreneurs. With limited extra effort, you can stretch your marketing budget further and ensure you get a strong return on your investment.

1572,"(September 27, 2015) BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (PRWEB) September 27, 2015 

Last week Aaron Peacock filed a class action lawsuit (1:15-cv-03349-MHC, US District Court, Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division) against Volkswagen of America amid allegations from the EPA that the company programmed engine management software in some diesel cars to turn on emission controls only when being tested. Once those cars were put on the road, they would emit up to 40 times more emissions, the Environmental Protection Agency said. According to court documents, Peacock intentionally sought out this vehicle in a conscious effort to reduce my consumption and environmental impact and VW explicitly marketed to people with similar goals.""

The class action lawsuit accuses Volkswagen of fraudulent concealment, deceptive trade practices, false advertising, breach of contract and warranties, and violating consumer rights laws. According to a September 18th report from the EPA, Volkswagen installed its defeat device in at least the following diesel models of its vehicles: 

VW Jetta, 2009 2015 

VW Jetta SportWagen, 2009 2014 

VW Beetle, 2009 2015 

VW Golf, 2009 2015 

VW Golf SportWagen, 2015 

VW Passat, 2012 2015 

Audi A3, 2009 2015 

The defeat devices Volkswagen allegedly designed and installed work by switching on the full emissions control systems in Volkswagen diesel cars only when the car is undergoing periodic emissions testing. The technology needed to control emissions from Volkswagen diesel cars reduces their performance, and limits acceleration, torque, and fuel efficiency. To hide this, the defeat device simply shuts off most of the emissions control systems in the car once the car has completed its emissions test. This resulted in VW cars sending up to 40 times as much pollution into the environment as is allowed under the Clean Air Act and state regulations. 

Mr. Peacock is represented by Lew Garrison at Heninger Garrison Davis. Garrison's firm, which includes many lawyers working on the VW emission lawsuit is representing these clients on an individual basis in all states for its lawsuits. Heninger Garrison Davis would like to help VW diesel and Audi A3 diesel owners. The law firm recently launched http://www.vwemissionslawyer.com to provide information and a new way to contact our VW emissions lawyers.

1444,"One Maury County organization celebrated a decade of work with a mayoral proclamation recognizing its mission and September as “Suicide Prevention Awareness” month. 
 
Cowboy Up is a Maury County Junior Auxiliary service project that focuses on prevention of youth suicide through educational programs. The project began in 2005 as the brainchild of local educator Regina Peery. 
 
Maury County Mayor Charlie Norman signed the document at the courthouse last with Cowboy Up and JA members. 
 
The proclamation states suicide is “one of the most disruptive and tragic events a family and a community can experience.” There have been 69 recorded suicides in Maury County in the past five years, including three that were between the ages of 10 and 19, according to the document. 
 
“Whereas, public awareness of the terrifying problem is the key to preventing further suffering and loss of life; and the risk for human self-destruction can be reduced through awareness, education and treatment; and as the highest risk for suicide is among the survivors of those who died by suicide or those who have attempted suicide,” it reads. 
 
The document goes on to tout Cowboy Up’s role in the community and declares September as Suicide Prevention Month in the county. 
 
For Peery, Cowboy Up has a personal meaning. Her brother, Marcus, committed suicide in 2003, and she founded the organization in 2005 in his memory. The name is based on a saying he used. 
 
Peery said she wants to do anything in her power to prevent another family from going through the “wrath” of suicide. 
 
“I hope that this creates more awareness for people who may be having suicidal feelings to know that there is help available and for families who have been touched by suicide,” she said. “We want them to know that they are not alone.” 
 
The program has garnered attention from across the state. The Tennessee Suicide Prevention Network honored Peery with an award in 2013. 
 
Cowboy Up is presented to all seventh grade students in Maury County and other school districts. The group’s motto is taken from her father’s words. 
 
“If we help one family, one child, then it is worth everything that we put into it,” Peery said. 
 
Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among youth and young adults ages 15-24 in Tennessee and for the entire United States, according to the TSPN. There were 945 recorded suicide deaths in the state in 2014, at a rate of 14.4 per 100,000 people, according to the organization. 
 
Cowboy Up is a project of Junior Auxiliary members, the Maury County school system, the Jason Foundation, Tennessee Suicide Prevention Network and the Maury County Sheriff Reserves. 
 
“It has taken a lot of folks to make it successful, and to be able to celebrate that today and acknowledge that and create awareness, it means more than I can fit into words,” Peery said.

Six soldiers including four Americans were injured on Thursday in two blasts in northeast Sinai caused by improvised explosive devices, the Pentagon said. 

The Multinational Force and Observer peacekeepers were evacuated ""by air to a medical facility where all are receiving treatment for non-life-threatening injuries,"" Captain Jeff Davis said in a statement. 

The four Americans were struck by the second blast as they were en route to help the soldiers hurt in the first, according to Major Roger Cabiness. 

The MFO was created as a result of the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel and is based in Sinai, the peninsula that lies between Israel, the Gaza Strip and the Suez Canal. About 650 Americans are currently assigned to the force, Cabiness said. 

Israel has called on Egypt to crack down on growing lawlessness in the Sinai, which has become a hideout for jihadi groups opposed to Israel. 

Islamist militants were suspected of killing 16 border guards last month in North Sinai, prompting Egypt to send armored vehicles and hundreds of troops in the biggest build-up in the demilitarized zone since Egypt's 1973 war with Israel.

3721,"First off, this editor's note is long-overdue. Between deadlines, talking, emailing and texting writers, photographers and other contributors, as well as discussing and planning potential stories and meeting the public, I never seem to have the time. 
  
But there have been some recent news developments in Alameda that have encouraged me to write. It was a real treat to see Angela's restaurant finally reopen this past week on north Park Street to a packed crowd -- and seeing passers-by and the curious stopping by the new place to look inside to see what all the activity was about. 
  
The reopening of Angela's restaurant represents not only a rebirth but a redemption for owner Saboor Zafari and his family. Angela's had been set to open a year ago -- but three days before the scheduled opening it was gutted in a suspected arson fire across the street on Park. 
  
""The community has been amazingly wonderful,"" Zafari told the Alameda Journal's Peter Hegarty in an Aug. 21 article. ""I go for walks, and people stop me and ask how I am doing. They ask if they can help and want to know when the restaurant will open. It means a lot to me."" 
 
 
  
Now, Angela's joins a growing list of new eateries lining the north Park Street area, including Smashburger, KauKau Corner, Thai Noodle House and Crispian Bakery, along with what's already at the Marketplace. It's nice to see this part of Park Street full of activity, especially during the weekends and nights. 
  
This bustle of activity is being played out increasingly throughout Alameda -- on lower Park Street, in the new places in Alameda Landing (Cream, The Habit Grill, Spin!Neapolitan Pizza) as well as the popular Rock Wall Winery and Faction Brewing on the former Naval base. And, this Sunday, Webster Street is hoping to join the mix with the new Blues, Brews & BBQ Festival at the US Bank parking lot. 
  
Hiroko Cooper, a co-founder of the West End Arts & Entertainment District which is partnering with the West Alameda Business Association to host the event, tells Janet Levaux in an Alameda Journal article this week: ""Everyone is looking forward to this, and it should be really new and different. All the volunteers have been so supportive. The community is really helping and pitching in, which is very heartwarming."" 
  
All of this activity brings an air of excitement and fun to Alameda -- and all these events are positives for the Island. 
  
But this activity, especially on weekends and holidays, brings increased traffic, congestion and gridlock -- and increases the risk of accidents and, tragically, fatalities. As much as we'd like to go back in time, when we didn't have as much traffic, crowds or congestion, we can't. 
  
But we can do something about speeding on streets. And pedestrians can help by not crossing the street against the light or in oncoming traffic. 
  
On Labor Day, Alameda blues musician Augusta Lee Collins, 69, was struck and killed by a truck on southbound Constitution Way at about noon. Collins was walking in a crosswalk and had almost reached the sidewalk when he was hit by the truck in the far right-hand lane on the opposite side of the street of the Marina Village Shopping Center, said Alameda police Lt. Ron Simmons. 
  
Police were interviewing witnesses to try to determine whether the pedestrian or the truck driver had the green light when the accident occurred. And police said it didn't appear that either drugs or alcohol played a part in this tragic accident. 
  
I don't know the details about what exactly happened, but I'm saddened by the fact that someone was killed on our streets. Collins was scheduled to perform at Sunday's Blues, Brews & BBQ Festival. 
  
We as drivers and pedestrians need to remember that we share the roads -- and we need to remember the tragic consequences when we ignore the rules of the road.

were mixed on Tuesday as investors awaited the U.S. Federal
Reserve's interest rate decision, with the Indonesian index
retreating after weak August trade data, but Malaysian shares
rose on stimulus and ahead of a holiday.
    Jakarta's composite index fell 1.2 percent,
reversing Monday's gain, when the market saw net foreign buying
for the first time in 10 trading days. 
    Selling in large-caps was broad-based, with 28 out of 30
stocks measured by the MSCI index of Indonesia 
falling. Real-estate developer Bumi Serpong Damai was
down 4 percent, among the top losers on the index, on
foreign-led selling.
    Data showed Indonesia posted a $433 million trade surplus in
August, smaller than the $630 million surplus forecast in a
Reuters poll. The surplus was only one-third of the revised
$1.38 billion that the country had in July. 
    Malaysia's index rose 0.5 percent. It had rallied on
Monday after Prime Minister Najib Razak said the government
would inject 20 billion ringgit ($4.6 billion) into a state
investment firm to shore up the stock market. 
    Malaysia will be closed on Wednesday for a market holiday.
    The Thai SET index inched up 0.2 percent after three
days of losses. Optimism about the government's infrastructure
investment sent shares of Italian Thai Development up
0.6 percent.
    The SET is poised to be range-bound or ease slightly on
Tuesday, ahead of the Fed rate decision, to be known on Thursday
night in Bangkok, said broker KGI Securities.
    ""While most economists take a 'no hike' view, the

4392,"- Intermap and Atkins sign licensing agreement for natural catastrophe hazard data - 

DENVER, Sept. 24, 2015 /PRNewswire/ - Intermap Technologies (TSX:IMP), (ITMSF:BB), a leading provider of location-based solutions, today announced that it has entered into an agreement with Atkins, one of the world's most respected design, engineering, and project management consultancies, to include their natural catastrophe risk and hazard data archives, including North American earthquake data, in its InsitePro software product. 

InsitePro is Intermap's cloud-based risk assessment software designed to help property insurance underwriters assess location-based risk. With its configurable analytic engine, InsitePro allows users to design risk scoring analytics that address specific business needs. InsitePro applies reliable peril and geospatial data in a way that fits a carrier's approach to risk. 

""InsitePro's flood analytics are changing the way flood insurance is priced and delivered,"" stated Product Manager Ivan Maddox. ""With the Atkins agreement, Intermap will be offering risk scores for all natural perils, including earthquake, hail, tornado, and wind (straight-line and hurricane). InsitePro can now replicate the innovation brought to flood risk assessment across these other perils, delivering custom analytics to underwriters that are based on dependable data and their own view of risk."" 

Using InsitePro, carriers can automate the risk pricing activities that they are comfortable with and identify risks that need further analysis by an underwriter. It offers fast answers for most properties and allows the carrier to add value where appropriate. Including all perils will enable a carrier to write complete property coverage for homes and businesses to differentiate themselves from carriers that only offer standard coverage.

3406,"The cyber mailman has been busy delivering your questions and comments so let’s get right to it.  Last week, I wrote about the death of long-time Philly Show promoter Bob Schmierer and my memories of when this incredible show was held at the George Washington Motor Lodge in Willow Grove, PA.  Rock Hoffman of Glenside, PA shared his memories—and an update on the site where the hotel once stood: The site of the old George Washington Motor Lodge is now mostly a Home Depot although that field you wrote has never been developed. I’m sure you remember that the field usually served as overflow parking for the show. Your story brought back many memories of attending shows there. The first show I ever went to was in 1977 as a seven-year-old. My first purchase was a 1977 Jim Kaat to complete my Phillies team set. I bought it off of a husband and wife (I think his name was Frank). Their table was right there as soon as you made the right after paying. They were always in that same spot. I remember not really understanding why they had a pile of Jim Kaats and I could never get one from packs.  Red Merchant, Boston Braves fan and from San  Antonio reminded us of his favorite early 1950s Braves and the Lew Burdette error card, which shows him not only pitching with the wrong hand but spells his name “Lou” instead of “Lew”.   I wrote about it last year. So, as I’m going through memories of my past life, I open up this trunk that has been sitting for ages.  Inside, my baseball card collection of basically Boston/Milwaukee Braves from before I enter the Air Force in ‘62.  Warren Spahn, Bob Buhl, Johnny Antonelli, George Crowe – they’re  all in there.  Then you look at the (1959 Topps) Burdette card, and then you go looking on the internet, and it leads me to you!  A question:  Do we know just how many of these were printed?  Was the entire collection run, with no one noticing that the spelling, as well as the picture were wrong?  Thanks for your time.  Red, unless we find the Topps archives and the paperwork is complete we’ll never how many of each card was produced but we can say the “Lefty” Burdette card was never corrected but is still popular with collectors and a great conversation piece. Burdette was sent to the Braves late in the 1951 season by the Yankees for Johnny Sain. While Sain was not a front line starter for the Yankees he did help them the next three World Series while Burdette went on to win over 200 games in the rest of his career, most of them for the Braves. Collector George O’Neal wrote us about this year’s Topps Chrome and something a lot of collectors are experiencing, which I noted in my box break/review last week: I’m having a heck of a time telling which card is a refractor.  Is there a trick?  I’ve been collecting Chrome for about five years now, and it wasn’t really ever this hard to tell (and it helped with the ‘refractor’ tag on the back of an actual card too).  George, the way I found out was I had two Paul Konerko cards and was able to hold them to the light to determine the refractor. We mentioned in our review how we wished Topps would have labeled the refractors. We noticed in the Bowman Chrome preview information  thatall refractor cards appear to be serial numbered. To me, even if there is no refractor labeling, cards with serial numbers are sufficient to contrast those to base cards. Rick Friedman wrote us in response to my column about the 20th anniversary of Cal Ripken breaking Lou Gehrig’s record and his commitment to sign autographs for fans after each game. I have been reading your articles for some time, and thank you for doing them. They bring a little joy to my stressful business day, while I take a 10 minute ” vacation” and look at the various links.  Many of the links have been costly….turning me on to new auction site, only to find an item I just cannot live without.  Anyway, your recent article about Cal Ripken signing  autographs reminds me of Pete Rose.  When I was 14-16 years old I was a “lobby rat” and “stadium rat”, getting all the players’ autographs from that era (late 1960s and early 1970s) but one who impressed me was Rose, who would stand in the street and sign autographs for anyone there and talk to them with respect.  I would be amazed that as the Reds team would check into a hotel at midnight, all the players ran into their rooms but the star of the team, who would stand in the street or lobby, and sign autographs for what seemed forever ( maybe 15 -30 minutes).  He loved being Pete Rose. I got hooked on collecting HOF memorabilia after a few trips to Cooperstown and created in the last six years my own mini Hall of Fame and now have about 600 museum artifacts.  Bats, gloves, signed ball, uniforms, caps, photos and now have a very serious collection.  I thought I had a great collection until I  visited Gary Cypres’ LA Sports Museum last year which put me in my place.  He owns EVERTHING  from the Yankees and Dodgers  in a building about two blocks long. It’s interesting to hear collectors’ experiences with various players, especially those memories from before autographs were a commodity.  Despite his issues over the years, Pete still has an enormous fan base and probably won a lot of them over during those signing sessions so many years ago.  And yes, Gary Cypres’ collection is a national treasure.   We also received a great email from an old dealer comrade of mine, Glenn Peddicord, from New Jersey who enjoyed a column I wrote awhile back about the 1967 Topps Brooks Robinson.   I now live in Indiana, but I still plan to move back to my hometown of Baltimore in the next couple of years.  I am still in the hobby, but only as a collector. I have been putting together 1950s & 1960s Topps and Bowman sets, which is something I should have done back in the 1980s.  Oh well. It was great to hear from Glenn. When I was working in Mike Gordon’s shop back in the late 1980s, the store ordered 350 cases of 1989 Fleer factory sets since that was the only item they offered directly to the hobby. When the truck delivered them, it was Glenn who helped carry all of  those sets from the truck into the store– and some into the basement. Now, in those days, one could have just made a couple of dollars on each set by offering them to the other dealers in the area but not every dealer was comfortable wholesaling to others  As it developed, Ken Griffey Jr. really took off the next year and Mike did fine selling the sets himself. But it always is a good discussion which persists to this day. Some dealers are fine working with their fellow dealers while others are retail to the public only. Even today, those decisions are up to the individual dealer.",22c7c113-9bfd-4181-8a1e-6dd5373370a3,Blog,2015-09-10T01:19:40Z,Sports Collectors Daily,Ramblings:  Reader Reaction,1.0,News

748,"Students demonstrate an eco-friendly farm at the 'Solve for Tomorrow' National Youth Scientific Innovation and Experiment contest in Beijing. [Photo/Provided to chinadaily.com.cn] The use of wood pulp for paper making has long been a threat to forest preservation but an innovative idea from Chinese college students might offer a solution.

The technology of making paper from processed poultry feathers became a focal point at the regional final of the 2015 ""Solve for Tomorrow"" National Youth Scientific Innovation and Experiment contest for its potential to ease the industry's dependence on forest resources.

Developed by a three-student team from Tianjin University of Science and Technology, the innovation was patented as a ""new invention"" by the State Intellectual Property Office in May and was considered a favorite to win the creative segment of this year's contest.

""The idea just came from our curiosity about where all the feathers from chicken consumed in McDonald's and KFCs go. Then we found they could be useful with fibers available for paper making,"" Zhang Rongqi, a junior student in the development team, told China Daily at the China Science and Technology Museum, venue for the contest.

Feather-made paper has been produced as decorative wallpaper in a trial, while fiber separated from feathers through the new technology could also be used in air-purifying membrane production, said Ou Huajie , another team member.

However, the invention remains far from implementation as it needs further development for mass processing and production, according to the team.

The invention was one of 17 new technologies or ideas reaching regional finals of the contest's creative segment, in which students demonstrated their inventions through 20 minutes of presentation, operation and question and answer sessions with the judging panel, which included renowned scholars, officials and notary officers.

The contest also includes a challenge segment, which requires students to fulfill three assignments – smart transportation, wind power utilization and security protection – by making use of a limited number of tools and resources.",6e4eea64-6018-45bd-b1b8-cc3dd88c1378,News,2015-09-22T14:24:19Z,CHINAdaily.com.cn,Ecological paper-making idea is feather in the cap of students,0.0,News

We have made significant progress on the installation of a new body shop, a new paint shop and new stamping presses that will establish new capacity for both Model X and Model S.” The email also provided this information about the economic advantages of electric cars: Common evaluations of Model S vs. gasoline cars often overlook the full economic advantages of going electric: they look at cost of purchase but not the true cost of ownership. National and state/province clean energy incentives can significantly improve the price of an EV. In the US, for example, the price of a Model S after incentives, depending on the state, usually drops by about $10k. Running cost savings are considerable. Using the national average cost per kWh of $0.12 and a 40 mile daily commute, topping up at home is under $2.00. Compared to a similar gasoline premium sedan, the operational cost savings are typically around $2000 per year. Taking into account the average ownership period for a car of five years, that amounts to a total of approximately $10,000. Moreover, the operational savings show up immediately if you lease or finance the Model S. In addition, many utilities offer incentives for off-peak charging, allowing savings of up to 50% depending on local utility provider. Our charge time and cost calculator shows just how little it costs to charge at home. Also, electric cars typically require less service than gasoline cars, delivering further savings through the lifetime of ownership. All of these savings make the transition to EV a compelling proposition.” MORE FROM LEARNBONDS",415b6198-d6ec-4e11-955b-09f307644ba5,Blog,2015-09-01T01:38:25Z,LearnBonds,"Tesla Motors, Inc (TSLA) Model X Update and More",1.0,Blog

4492,"HENDERSON, Ky. - Even though his team has outscored its opponents 189-7, Gibson Southern coach Nick Hart is having nightmares about Henderson County running back Damion Carter. 

“He is causing me a lot of sleepless nights this week,” said Hart, who remembers the Colonel running back well even though the school’s have never met in varsity competition. 

“We began playing Henderson County on the freshman level my first year here,” said Hart, who is in his fourth season as Gibson Southern’s head coach. “These seniors were freshmen then. Henderson County beat us that night and Carter torched us pretty good. I remember leaving the game that night saying, ‘I’m glad I’ll never have to try to stop that kid again.’” 

Carter, who is closing in on Henderson County’s career rushing record, is averaging 145.3 yards rushing a game this season for the Colonels. 

The Titans, who are 3-0 and ranked second in Indiana’s Class 3-A, typically enjoy a speed advantage over most of their opponents. “I think we’re going to be on the wrong end of the speed mismatch this Friday,” Hart said. But that was one of Hart’s reasons in wanting to add the series with Henderson County. 

“Henderson County has had a great program for a long time. They have the type of athletes that we won’t see until we are deep into the playoffs,” he said. 

Gibson Southern has a history of deep playoff runs in Hart’s three years with the program after four straight losing seasons before Hart’s arrival. He guided them to the state semifinals in his first two seasons. Last year, Gibson Southern lost to Heritage Hills 14-13 in the sectional finals. 

The Titans’ 32-member senior class includes 10 players who started as sophomores and three who started as freshmen. Senior quarterback Nick Sellers is one of those three-year starters. He threw for 2,336 yards last season but has only 42 attempts so far this season mainly because all three of the team’s games have been blowouts. 

Senior Griffin Scheller has been an all-state selection the last two years — once at defensive back and once at receiver. Scheller is primarily a defensive back this season as Gibson Southern will two-platoon as much as possible. Scheller, who enters the game on offense in certain situations, is still a big-play threat as he has taken four of his eight catches this season into the end zone. 

Gibson Southern’s pass-oriented attack spreads the ball around among several receivers. Running backs J.J. Miller and Dylan Stefanich are averaging around 100 yards rushing per game. 

The Titan defense, which gave up its first points of the season last week to North Posey in a 63-7 win, is led by senior lineman Cory Klem. “He has nine or 10 tackles for loss. He’s very disruptive,” Hart said. 

Opening the season with 63-0 wins over Pocket Athletic Conference opponents Forest Park and South Spencer, Hart is certain his team will face its toughest test of the season so far on Friday. 

“It’s not even close. Henderson may be 1-2, but they’d be 3-0 too if they had played our schedule,” Hart said. 

Friday’s game is the first game in a four-year contract between Henderson County and Gibson Southern. Hart, who is the son of former Reitz coach John Hart, played at Reitz for one season when Henderson County coach Tony Lewis was the defensive coordinator on his father’s staff. Lewis left after the season for his first head coaching position at Wheelersburg, Ohio.",40c3f9e0-9067-4807-8bee-8c17d41bfbcc,News,2015-09-11T04:15:58Z,The Henderson Gleaner,"Gibson Southern must deal with Carter, again",0.0,News

Depreciating homes increased from 7.60 percent to 23.40 percent while the number of appreciating homes has fallen from 65.20 to 56.80 percent, according to an analysis of July data from ""canary homes"" that are indicators of price trends in Weiss Residential Research's databases of nearly 100 million homes. 
   
""While a majority of homes nationwide is still gaining value, the national trend is clearly downward.  With the decline in year over year prices in the existing home sales report released today by the National Association of Realtors, even the national median price reports are picking up on the trend, reflecting the growing of numbers homes that are changing from appreciation to depreciation.  In this environment buyers and investors should be careful to avoid buying properties that are losing value by reviewing metro and Zip code maps on Owners.com that show hyper-local trends in changing value,"" Weiss said. 

Even seven of the top ten Metro markets with the highest levels of appreciation in July saw a year over year decline in the percentage of homes gaining more than 1.5 percent. Reno, Nevada leads the nation in appreciating properties in July, with more than 91.4 percent gaining value on a monthly bases, though 93.7 percent were appreciating a year ago.

About Weiss Residential Research 
Weiss Residential Research LLC was founded to help fill the knowledge and innovation gap that lead to the great housing crash of 2007 as well as to help mitigate the financial risk of home ownership going forward.  WRR is a pioneer in next generation home price analytics.    Building on Weiss' unique expertise in repeat sales home price indexes, he has increased the resolution of market analysis by nearly 10,000-fold.  WRR has created nearly 50 million repeat sales indexes, one for each house, through the use of Big Data techniques, novel algorithms and by harnessing the power of massively parallel multi-CPU computing power.   

Weiss' approach presents home price dynamics at the house level or any user defined aggregation. Instead of being forced to use arbitrary market definitions such as 'metro area', users can define their own markets such as 'all houses with a current value above $500,000 within a 50 mile radius of the Statue of Liberty.'  In some cases markets organically define themselves as can be seen by the clustering in our market maps and dynamic maps. New trends can therefore be discovered, new sub markets defined, compared and ranked.

6144,"This undated photo provided by the Monroe County Heritage Museum…   
MONROEVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- Long a hero to millions of readers, Atticus Finch is a conflicted figure these days. 

Is the fictional lawyer the kind father and noble hero of Harper Lee's first novel ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" a character so beloved people named their children for him? Or is Finch the hard-core segregationist whose racism is at the heart of Lee's newly released ""Go Set a Watchman?"" 

Based on the decades-old writings of the Southern man who inspired Finch, Lee's father A.C. Lee, the truth is somewhere in between. 

A small-town newspaper editor long before ""Mockingbird"" was published, Lee expressed support for racial segregation, wistfulness for the vanquished Confederacy and a strict brand of conservatism in the pages of The Monroe Journal, which he owned and ran in the south Alabama town of Monroeville for nearly two decades beginning in 1929. 

Lee's favorite editorial topics were fiscal restraint, warnings about encroaching big government and opposition to alcohol. Still, he veered into race on occasion. 

Sounding much like the Atticus of ""Watchman"" -- released in July yet actually written before ""Mockingbird"" -- Lee cited states' rights in editorials opposing a 1938 proposed federal anti-lynching law, calling it a bid for Northern black votes. A few years earlier he had defended the prosecution of nine blacks wrongly accused of raping two white women in the infamous ""Scottsboro Boys"" case in north Alabama. 

Such positions were hardly unusual among whites in a South that was still recovering from the Civil War and used Jim Crow laws to impose strict segregation and limit the legal rights of blacks. Yet Lee also displayed another side that more resembled the heroic Atticus of ""Mockingbird."" 

Despite opposing the federal lynching bill, which never passed, Lee also editorialized against lynchings and published front-page stories that brought attention to the horror. He sometimes ran positive news stories about Monroe County's black community on the front page, an unusual practice for white-owned newspapers in the Deep South at the time. 

And once, Lee used the front page to seek public donations to help a 36-year-old black mother of 21 children who was struggling during the Great Depression. 

By some counts, Lee became more moderate later in life. He may have regretted some of his editorial stances by the time he died in 1962, when the civil rights movement was gaining steam. 

Yet Lee didn't take back a word in 1947, when he wrote his final editorial reflecting on his past writings. 

""And with the added experience of the years we are unable to recall any position we have previously taken on any important question that we would wish to change,"" Lee wrote. 

Charles Shields, who wrote an unauthorized biography of Harper Lee in 2006, said her father eventually saw the ""tsunami of change"" coming in the South as segregation laws fell and wanted to see society revamped in a proper, orderly way. 

""He was one for the process,"" said Shields, author of ""Mockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Lee."" 

But Shields said there's scant evidence that Lee abandoned his Jim Crow-era opinions and became a civil rights advocate. 

""He was moving in the direction of progressive political thought in the South at the time,"" said Shields. ""But he ran out of time."" 

Born 15 years after the Civil War ended, Lee already was an attorney in Monroeville by the time he purchased a share of the Monroe Journal and became editor just weeks before the stock market crash that triggered the Great Depression in 1929. Elected to the Alabama House of Representatives in 1927, he would remain a legislator until 1939, sponsoring bills aimed at fiscal restraint. 

In ""Mockingbird,"" Lee renamed her hometown ""Maycomb"" and created a story of childhood innocence interrupted by racial injustice in the South of the 1930s. She is cast as Jean Louise ""Scout"" Finch, a tomboy who watched her father practice law in the town's old courthouse. 

In ""Watchman,"" a grown-up Jean Louise returns home from New York on a train and is shocked to discover her beloved father is a segregationist who has joined the White Citizen's Council, dedicated to maintaining racial segregation. 

Lee's editorials make plain that he espoused at least some of the views that troubled Finch's more liberal daughter. 

Months after buying the Journal, Lee published a race-tinged editorial opposing formation of the U.S. Department of Education. 

""It is a matter of common knowledge among all informed people that where the federal government directs expenditure of large funds, or supervises its administration, no color or race lines are recognized,"" he wrote. ""The only safe course for us is to insist that the states be not disturbed in their administration of public education ..."" 

However, former neighbors remember him today more for his quiet strength, unfailing honesty and humility. 

""He was a good, honest man,"" said Norman Barnett, 98, whose uncle practiced law with Lee. ""He had a good family."" 

A leading member of the town's Methodist church, Lee frequently featured church news on the Journal's front page. He was anti-alcohol yet questioned whether Prohibition infringed on state powers. He regularly campaigned against taxes and suggested government expansion could lead to communism or Hitler-like control. 

Lee published admiring stories and editorials about the defeated Confederacy, calling rebel veterans ""noble warriors who battled to maintain our southern ideals."" Despite supporting many of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's policies, he later suggested that God let FDR die ""to make room for another leader"" because the president had gotten too close to labor unions. 

Local historian George Thomas Jones, who knew Lee for years and once caddied for him at the town golf course as a boy, said it's difficult to assess Lee's editorials of the 1930s and 1940s by the standards of 2015. 

Lee was ""always a conservative,"" said Jones, and his editorials were in step with the community of his time. 

""Mr. Lee was a very quiet-spoken man,"" said Jones, 92. ""When he did talk people listened to him because he had something to say.""",5351aa57-204f-40ed-808a-fe9b5ce60446,News,2015-09-19T15:15:03Z,MyMotherLode.com,Writings of Harper Lee's dad reveal Atticus Finch's conflict,0.0,Blog

3669,"People who perceived themselves to be overweight were at greater risk of gaining weight in recent studies from the U.S. and the UK. 

This was true whether or not their perceptions were correct. 

They also were more likely to overeat in response to stress, which explained a large part of the weight gain, researchers say. 

In the past, it was assumed that if people considered themselves to be overweight, they would have greater motivation to change their diet or level of exercise, the researchers write in the International Journal of Obesity. 

However, they point out, feeling overweight can also be risky, as past studies have shown that people who feel discriminated against because of their weight are more likely to gain weight. 

Lead author Eric Robinson at the University of Liverpool in England told Reuters Health by email that his team ""wanted to test the common assumption that being ignorant to one's weight status is always a bad thing."" 

The researchers used data from three different studies to determine how people's perceptions of their own weight affected their weight gain in adulthood 

First, they used data on close to 4000 18- to 28-year-olds from the U.S. National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The study collected information on participants' body mass index (BMI), which is a ratio of weight to height, and their self-rating of their weight. 

The researchers also used demographic information to control for factors such as sex, age, race/ethnicity, education level, income, and health conditions. 

Around 40 percent of the participants considered themselves overweight - and these young adults were more likely to gain weight over a seven year period, averaging a 0.9 point increase in BMI. 

This was true regardless of whether those participants really were overweight. 

The researchers also looked at data from the UK's National Child Development Study, which followed 6,740 23-year-olds through to middle age. Thirty-eight percent believed themselves to be overweight at the start of the study. 

Again, both overweight and normal weight people who thought they were overweight were more likely to gain weight than people who didn't - about 0.8 points more in BMI on average over a 22-year period. However, this effect was stronger for people who actually were overweight initially. 

The study team sought to control for factors known to increase the risk of weight gain and found that the results were not due to outside psychological, health, or environmental factors. 

Finally, using data from 3,372 middle-aged people in the Midlife in the U.S. Study, the researchers assessed whether people perceiving themselves to be overweight would overeat in response to stress, and whether this would explain the weight gain. 

At the start, 67 percent of participants believed they were overweight- and these people gained an average of 0.3 more BMI points over a 9-10 year period, compared to those who didn't consider themselves overweight. Stress-induced overeating was found to explain a significant portion of the weight gain. 

Jane Wardle, a clinical psychologist at University College London, said by email that these findings are important because one public health strategy has been to make sure that people who are overweight are aware of it. 

Wardle, who studies weight perception, noted that people who believe they are overweight may delay their weight loss efforts. She said that, ""a person might decide they should definitely start a diet tomorrow and meanwhile finish the cookies."" 

Wardle advised that healthcare professionals can help people identify practical steps to lose weight that are not too difficult. 

Robinson is concerned about the findings. They ""may tell us something important about the experience of being an 'overweight' person in the 21st century,"" he said. ""It's rare for identification of a health issue to be associated with that issue becoming worse.""",0ab7834d-6213-40a2-adfa-5aca547f0859,News,2015-09-23T11:11:17Z,FOXNews.com,People who see themselves as overweight are more likely to gain weight,0.0,News

7181,"Transgender Dad offended by “pregnant women”… hopes to breastfeed next child 30 Sep, 2015 by Scott McKay Print this article Font size -16+ Email Our readers do realize that “transgenderism” is nothing more than the humoring and coddling of mental illness, right? If not, let us prove it to you. Trevor MacDonald is a self identified female-to-male transgendered gay man, who’s given birth to two children since he transitioned. He’s expecting another baby in April. MacDonald explains he was born female but transitioned to male by taking hormones and having chest surgery. “When my partner and I decided to start a family, we got advice from my doctors and I stopped taking my testosterone. Because my surgery removed most of my breast tissue, I don’t know how much I’ll be able to breastfeed, but I really want to try.” He’s accused the midwifery community of “transphobia” in The Huffington Post. MacDonald argues that suggesting that trans guys who give birth are not men — but actually women, because of their biology — is “highly offensive to trans individuals because it denies our gender.” Some midwife organizations have already begun to remove offensive references that suggest that mothers are women, moving to instead call them “pregnant people” and “birthing individuals.” However, in a sign that all may not be lost in our culture, some midwifes, mothers and experts are pushing back. There is no such thing as “transphobia.” Normal people who have not been indoctrinated into the poison of political correctness rightly reject transsexuals as abnormal, and that is a natural reaction to an unnatural behavior – not evidence of some sort of mental illness, as attaching a “-phobia” to it would suggest. And a culture which enforces behavior like Trevor McDonald’s as normal (someone who calls herself a man and yet still bears children is not, in any serious sense, normal) rather than enforcing a rejection of such behavior is not a culture in ascendance. It’s a culture in decline, and swift decline at that. Also see...

Congress is back with a daunting must-do list, but its first order of business was the Iran nuclear deal. Senate Democrats successfully filibustered a disapproval resolution on Thursday that was meant to kill the deal. The vote was 58-42 —Senate Republicans and other opponents needed 60 to pass. 
 
It's an unusual vote (as NPR's Steve Inskeep explained ) — instead of voting on whether to approve the Iran deal, opponents tried to bring forward a disapproval resolution.

1610," Las Vegas, NV (KTNV) -- It's what fans of Uber and Lyft have been waiting for, both ride sharing services are officially up and running in Las Vegas. But it's not without its controversy, the rides are being offered without the blessing of Clark County Commissioners. 
 
An Action News crew decided to take both and Uber and Lyft rides to see how they are operating and how drivers feel about everything that's happened. 
 
It started with the push of a button and within seven minutes our crew had a Lyft from Robert Archer. 
 
""I was fiddling with my phone and the app came up, a ride that was on Gilespie, so I just punched it in and away we went,"" said Archer about how he officially learned that he could start offering rides. 
 
Our crew was his second ride. Earlier in the day officials from both Uber and Lyft went in front of the Clark County Commission to request temporary business licenses but were denied. Just hours later both services decide to start operating anyway with their state licenses.  
 
""When they make up their mind then fine and dandy, I'll go get a county license, if that's what it takes, I've got a state license now to operate,"" said Archer. 
 
Robert dropped our crew off at Charlie Frias Park where we asked people if they are comfortable with taking an Uber or Lyft ride, eventhough they don't have a county business licese. 
 
""Yes I would, yes I would, it's a big help,"" said Las Vegas resident Ioianna Athalone. 
 
""Yes I would because it's an easy way to get around especially if you don't have a car,"" said Bernard Matis. 
 
And to get back our crew used Uber. After just five minutes, Joshua Kaufman, our Uber driver arrived. Like Archer, he's happy the services are finally up and running. 
 
""Even beyond the price, it's simply because it's a clean car, you get friendly service in general and there are all these things that make it a better deal,"" said Kaufman. 
 
Both companies were licensed by the state on Monday and in a statement Uber said it's complying with all existing rules.",53826a7e-4a0d-4869-9191-eb858b6214c3,News,2015-09-16T06:33:00Z,KTNV,"Uber, Lyft officially operating in Las Vegas",0.0,Blog

7169,"A mother and daughter killed themselves in a horrific suicide pact after a warped fraudster trapped them in a staggeringly bizarre web of threats and lies. Yesterday, the full extent of Linsey Cotton’s heartless deception was disclosed in court.
Cotton, a single mother of two from West Lothian, invented a phantom girlfriend, a bogus stem cell trial, a fictitious murdering doctor and a non-existent government cover-up and she made up a whole cast of characters for her charade.
Cotton, 33, used 15 phones, two laptops and two tablet computers to convince her victims she was more than a dozen different people. At various points, she played a nurse, a barrister and government officials.
Her scam netted her nearly £5000 and a hoard of expensive gifts. But she also terrorised Margaret McDonough and daughter Nicola until they checked into a Premier Inn, took pills and slashed themselves.
Margaret, 52, died within hours of being found at the Greenock hotel on May 10, 2013. Nicola, 23, passed away three days later.
In the run-up to the tragedy, Cotton had convinced the women they faced 20 years in prison and turned their son and brother against them. Her lawyer said she was sorry. Cotton began her scheme a year before the double suicide by ensnaring Margaret’s son Michael, a 33-year-old corporal.
In May 2012, she joined dating site Plenty of Fish – using the name and photo of her stepsister Steph, who had nothing to do with the scam.
Michael saw “Steph” and fell for her. But when they began phoning each other, it was Cotton he was talking to, and she wasted no time filling his head with lies.
She told Michael that Steph was having trouble with her sister’s boyfriend. Then, posing as Steph’s mum, she said the boyfriend had attacked her and left her in hospital with bleeding on the brain.
Soon after, Cotton said Steph had been chosen for a pioneering stem cell trial run by a company called Biotech.
Cotton created a number of characters who told Michael on the phone that they were visiting Steph in hospital.
Michael by now believed Steph was his girlfriend and wanted to visit her too.But Cotton told him she was being moved around different hospitals and couldn’t see him because she had signed a confidentiality agreement for the trial.
Her lies then became even more elaborate. She told Michael a Biotech doctor had tried to kill Steph by poisoning her with drugs, that the Government were involved and that the press had been banned from reporting the case.

1863,"L ast fall one of my sons anguished over the price of a $150 textbook for a college calculus class. 
 
He looked for a used version or a rental, to no avail. So he dutifully bought the new book, put it on his desk in his dorm room, and never looked at it again. He used parts of a digital supplement packaged with it. The book, though, still in pristine condition, lies in a bin in his room at home. He wasn’t able to sell it back. 
 
There’s nothing unusual about that story, which makes it all the more disturbing, especially as college costs escalate. I hear similar examples all too frequently from the students I work with. A few semesters ago, a student in one of my classes even asked me outright: ""If I buy this book, will we use it?"" 
 
Federal regulations that took effect in 2010 were intended to provide clarity on textbook costs and, ideally, to make course materials more affordable. The regulations require publishers to disclose prices to faculty members and allow students to purchase books, CDs, and other supplemental material separately rather than as a bundle. The law also requires colleges to provide a list of required books and materials for students when they register for classes. 
 
That approach seems to be working, at least to an extent. Recent data from the National Association of College Stores show that students spent nearly 20 percent less on required course materials in the 2014-15 school year than they did in 2007-8. But that still amounts to $563 for an academic year, with a typical textbook selling for $79 (up from $57 in 2007). 
 
Increasingly, students simply refuse to buy textbooks even if professors require them, which is not surprising. Over the past four years, surveys have found that two-thirds to three-quarters of college students refused to buy textbooks because costs were too high and many instructors used only a few chapters. Others buy bootleg digital copies or photocopy chapters from books that other students have bought. Many alter their class schedules based on the price of textbooks. 
 
So what’s the point of textbooks? I’ve never been a fan of them, either as a student or as a professor. By textbooks, I mean books that survey the breadth of a topic, chapter by boring chapter. They are intended to feed required information to students, not to help them think or learn. As an undergraduate, I found these types of books turgid and pedantic. They offered little in the way of enlightenment. Rather, they felt like punishment. Like students today, I avoided them whenever I could. 
 
All too often, professors use textbooks and lectures in tandem. They start with the book and plan a course around it, picking a chapter here and a chapter there, or simply following along with the author’s outline and instructor’s supplement. Then they assemble students in a lecture and tell them the points of the textbook they should pay attention to. (Or should have paid attention to had they bought the book.) 
 
That approach emphasizes facts over thinking. It looks at information as rare and static rather than abundant and dynamic. The world has moved on from that model. But in far too many cases, education hasn’t, treating students as empty vessels that need filling rather than as distinct individuals who need guidance in learning on their own. It’s an information-first approach rather than a learning-first approach, one that emphasizes the what rather than the how and the why. 
 
I certainly understand textbooks’ attraction for teachers, especially overworked, underpaid adjuncts and graduate students who lack the time and resources to teach any other way. The books provide a ready-made framework for classes. They offer a consistent form of information that instructors can rely on across multiple class sections. They save time by cutting down on the need to constantly search for new material, especially when publishers provide lesson plans, PowerPoint presentations, and quizzes. And yes, even in a world of dynamic information, students need some foundational information and understanding to work with. 
 
So I’m not arguing that textbooks are evil or that instructors who use them are remiss. But here’s what I would like to see teachers do: Before you assign a textbook, check the price. Ask yourself whether students really need it and will truly learn from reading it. Check to see whether an open-source alternative is available. Scour the web and enlist your college’s librarians to find articles and posts that provide the same — or even better — information as in the textbook. Have your students find and recommend readings for your class. Work with colleagues to create a shared pool of effective course materials. Work with your teaching center to improve your approach to using class materials and class time for learning. 
 
In short, work through the decision to assign a textbook as you would a research question: Gather information. Weigh competing options and opinions. Move beyond the obvious. Innovate wherever possible. Revise. Seek feedback from peers. Revise again. Then justify your conclusion in clear, convincing terms. 
 
That’s what you expect your students to do. It’s not easy. But then neither is paying hundreds of dollars a semester for unused textbooks.

183,"GLADSTONE'S Northern Oil Refinery is looking at expanding by taking on two apprentices and a lab technician. 

The refinery at Yarwun is the only facility in Queensland that recycles waste lube oil back into base lube oil. 

Northern Oil Refineries general manager Andrew Smith, who has been on the job for six months, said the refinery was already looking to take on two apprentices and a lab technician. 

""We have the capacity to do 100 million litres per annum but we are currently doing 50,"" he said. 

""If more businesses gave us their used oil we could employ more people. We've only developed half of the site as well."" 

Queensland shadow minister for environment Stephen Bennett visited the oil refinery yesterday. 

""They have taken on an exciting challenge and the innovation here has made them world leaders,"" Mr Bennett said. 

""It's a great example of things to come in the waste management field. 

""It's the most environmentally responsible treatment of waste lube oil, where every component of the waste lube oil is reused and 99% of the lube oil is recovered as high quality lube oil for use. 

""We need more companies to have vision and continue to invest and properly deal with their waste."" 

JJ Richards and Sons is responsible for transporting used oil to the site. 

Gladstone branch manager Lockie McGaw said oil came from all over Queensland. 

""We can transport around 47,000L of oil. It's not a big part of our region because we're diversified here in Gladstone,"" he said. 

JJ Richards and Sons business development manager Richard Taylor said most oil in the region came from mines and industries. 

""It's great to be able to have a circular economy where we can get something that is used and refine it back to quality lube oil to put back into the system,"" he said.

4906,"The aspect ratio of any given movie literally frames our experience of the entire work. Whereas real-life exists in 360 degrees in all directions, filmmakers must make very conscious decisions about what to put inside that box, what to exclude from it, and how to present it all to the audience. 
 
For the most part, movies stick to a few standard widescreen aspect ratios, or, if the filmmaker is feeling a bit daring, the less common 4:3 aspect ratio. (For example, Fish Tank  and  Ida .) But one video essay argues there’s been a rise in experimentation with non-traditional aspect ratios, including films that change proportions mid-scene (i.e., Tom at the Farm or  Life of Pi ) or reject the idea of a rectangular frame altogether (Gust Van den Berghe’s  Lucifer ). Watch and learn after the jump.

9421,"Image: obesity rates by state. Source: CDC
Written by Marc Torrence, Patch National Staff
The Centers For Disease Control and Prevention has released the latest data on nationwide adult obesity, and, not surprisingly, a bunch of people out there could stand to eat less or exercise more — and probably a bit of both.
But in Massachusetts, people are considerably healthier than most of the rest of the country. The commonwealth has one of the lowest obesity rates in the nation at 23.3 percent. Only Hawaii (22.1 percent), Washington, D.C. (21.7 percent) and Colorado (21.3 percent) have lower rates.
The state with the highest rate of obesity was Arkansas at 35.9 percent, followed by West Virginia (35.7 percent), Mississippi (35.5 percent), Louisiana (34.9 percent) and Alabama (33.5 percent). Colorado had the lowest.
The CDC defines obesity based on Body Mass Index, which is a person’s mass in kilograms divided by the square of his or her height in meters.
A person with a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese.
So, for example, someone who is 5-foot-9 and 203 pounds would fall under that definition. If you want to calculate your own BMI, use the CDC’s handy calculator below:
Nationwide, 34.9 percent of adults and 17 percent of children 19 years and younger are obese, according to the CDC’s latest data.

A total of 23.3 percent of Massachusetts adults are considered obese. Non-Hispanic whites had the lowest obesity rate in Massachusetts (22.6%), followed by Hispanics (30.9%) and non-Hispanic blacks at (31.4%).﻿
Regionally, Midwesterners were the most obese in terms of population, with 30.7 percent, followed closely by the South at 30.6. The Northeast (27.3) and West (25.7) had the lowest rates.
While every state in the country reported at least a 20 percent obesity rate, five states and the District of Columbia were below 25 percent, with California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Vermont joining Colorado in that distinction.
The results were also broken out by race for the second time since the survey began.
Non-Hispanic blacks had the highest obesity rate at 38.1 percent, followed by Hispanics (31.3 percent) and non-Hispanic whites (27.1 percent).

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. 

Black, white, red, blue ... the choice of color is up to you. But don't be fooled into thinking your shiny new vehicle is invulnerable to unforeseen, costly accidents. The best way to watch your back and ensure protection for your wallet is by purchasing a guaranteed asset protection (GAP) waiver, which helps protect your investment from the moment you receive the keys.

""Accidents happen unexpectedly and often lead to stress and tremendous debt,"" said Tim Meenan 

While driving around in your new set of wheels might be the only thing on your mind, it's important to remember that the value of your car depreciates the minute it leaves the lot. From a stolen to completely totaled car, most insurers only cover the cost of the vehicle's current market value, and since your vehicle's value has fallen since you bought it, you'll pay the difference in cost out of pocket.

GAP waivers help cover the difference, and offer other important stress-relieving benefits. In the case of an accident, you might be left paying for a car you no longer have. GAP waivers can alleviate some or all of your loan debt.

With a GAP waiver, you can simply relax and enjoy your new car – after all, that's why you bought it. Don't waste time worrying about how you'll pay for an unexpected accident, because GAP waivers have you covered.

For more information about GAP waivers, visit www.gapalliance.org.

4357,"By now surely you've heard of the Mediterranean diet. 

It's a pattern of eating that emphasizes fish, nuts, legumes, fruits, vegetables, fruits and olive oil — lots of olive oil. 

The evidence of its benefits has been piling up. For instance, a 2013 study in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that the diet can protect against heart disease. Another study published earlier this year revealed it can help fend off memory loss. 

Now, researchers say that eating a Mediterranean diet supplemented with four tablespoons per day of extra-virgin olive oil reduces the risk of breast cancer. 

""We found a strong reduction in the risk of breast cancer,"" says Miguel Martinez Gonzalez , an author of the study and a leading researcher on the preventative health effects of the Mediterranean diet at the University of Navarra in Spain. 

For his latest study, which appears Monday in JAMA: Journal of the American Medical Association , Martinez Gonzales assigned about 4,000 women between the ages of 60 and 80 to follow either the Mediterranean-plus-olive-olive-diet or a low-fat diet. 

He found that the women following the Mediterranean diet had a 68 percent lower relative risk of developing breast cancer during a five-year follow-up period compared to women on the low-fat diet. 

And one of JAMA's editors, Mitchell Katz, weighed in on the study in a separate editor's note. 

""Of course, no study is perfect,"" he wrote. And there are certainly limitations to this one, including the fact that this was a homogeneous group of white women. 

But, Katz points out, the Mediterranean diet is known to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and ""may also prevent breast cancer."" 

In conclusion, he wrote, ""we hope to see more emphasis on Mediterranean diet to reduce cancer and cardiovascular disease and improve health and well-being."" 

What's tricky about the findings, Katz tells The Salt in an interview, is that it's hard to know which compound, or compounds, in the Mediterranean diet could be most beneficial. 

But given that the group of women with the lowest rate of breast cancer consumed about four tablespoons of olive oil in their diet each day, ""it makes you wonder whether it's something in the extra-virgin olive oil."" 

As we've reported, extra-virgin olive oil is, in essence, the fresh-squeezed juice of an olive. ""It's a fruit juice,"" Tom Mueller, author of the book on olive oil Extra Virginity , told us a few years back. 

And inside are a whole range of potentially beneficial compounds known as polyphenols. One of them is oleocanthal, which ""possesses similar anti-inflammatory properties to ibuprofen [pain reliever],"" according to a study published in 2011. 

And, as we've told you before: when it comes to choosing extra virgin olive oil, fresh is best, so look for a harvest date on the bottle.",26ca04b3-4c0f-45f3-bec5-1c0bf70fffa1,News,2015-09-14T09:54:00Z,KCUR 89.3 FM,Mediterranean Diet With Extra Olive Oil May Lower Breast Cancer Risk,0.0,News

""She was my best friend. I admire how she handled this. She was a wonderful, brave and a beautiful person and I love her,"" Joan, 82, said. In a career spanning four decades, Collins sold more than 500 million copies in 40 countries across the world. 
Even after being diagnosed with cancer, she wrote five more books. Her latest, 600-plus-page novel, 'The Santangelos,' was published in June. The family statement said the writer lived ""a wonderfully full life and was adored by family, friends and readers. 
 
""She was a true inspiration, a trailblazer for women in fiction and a creative force. She will live on through her characters but we already miss her beyond words,"" it added. She began writing as a teenager, making up racy stories for her school-friends. Her first novel, 'The World is Full of Married Men', was published in 1968 and became a bestseller.  
 
Her first novel 'The World is Full of Married Men' was published in 1968 and became a bestseller. It was, however, banned in Australia. In 1985, her novel 'Hollywood Wives' was made into a mini-series by ABC, starring Anthony Hopkins and Candice Bergen. 'The Stud' was her second novel published in 1969. ",f1f6590b-bbf6-4421-9931-c51d75b6cb31,News,2015-09-20T11:22:00Z,DNA India,Popular novelist Jackie Collins passes away at the age of 77,0.0,News

193,"If you’re in the market for a new mattress, you want something that is both comfortable and durable. Comfort is easy; durability isn’t. That’s why we’ve come up with this list of five things that will help your new mattress last longer. You already have to spend a big chunk of money — it just makes sense to extend the life of your mattress as long as possible. 
 Use a Waterproof Mattress Pad  
Mattress pads are not just for children. They help protect mattresses from moisture and wear . When you buy a new mattress, make sure to get a protection pad to go with it. This will help your mattress last longer. Mattress pads are relatively inexpensive, especially if you don’t opt to get a memory foam pad or something extra that you don’t need with a new mattress. Some pads include a moisture-proof barrier, and these will protect your mattress the best. 
 Rotate the Mattress Every Couple of Months  
If you’re like most people, you sleep in the same position every night. Over time, this causes your mattress to sag and become uneven. Don’t let this happen to your new mattress. Instead, rotate your mattress 180 degrees every couple of months. Just make it part of your deep cleaning routine or think about whether your mattress needs to be rotated when you are changing the linens. Some of the longest lasting mattresses can be flipped over, too. Mattresses are heavy — you might have to enlist someone’s help to rotate or turn it over. 
 Change the Linens and Vacuum Often  
Bed linens collect dust and allergens and absorb body odors. If you leave them on your bed too long, these problems transfer to your mattress. That’s why it’s recommended that you change your sheets every week and wash your duvet frequently. Not only does this help your mattress last longer, it helps you sleep better, too. You should also vacuum your mattress so that dust and allergens do not sit on it for too long. 
 Don’t Let Your Pet Sleep with You  
It doesn’t matter how clean you think your pet is — he will drag unwanted things like dirt and dander onto your mattress. Accidents are also a possibility, even for well-trained pets. To help your mattress last longer, don’t let your pet sleep with you. The pet snuggles are best kept for when you’re both awake and off the bed and can enjoy them better. 
 Choose a Good Mattress in the First Place

There are a lot of different mattresses out there and the prices vary widely. Don’t buy the cheapest thing you can find because it probably won’t last very long. Instead, read as many mattress reviews as you can, and try mattresses out for yourself. Buying a reliable mattress that fits your particular needs and sleep habits will give you a bigger bang for your buck. 
 
These tips should help your new mattress last longer. Start implementing them as soon as your mattress comes through the door. Sweet dreams!

Chuck Todd told the “Morning Joe” panel Monday that he gets the sense from Hillary Clinton’s campaign, “that they feel vulnerable enough that the last thing they need is yet another hurdle” which would come from a Joe Biden candidacy. 
 
The “Meet the Press” host wondered where the support for a “historic female candidacy” was and he argued that “women are not galvanized” to support Hillary Clinton. 
 
Katty Kay : What are her and her team making of the numbers? What 75% up in June and now 53% national, is that something? 
 
Chuck Todd : They’re trying, even off the record you can’t get them to panic. I think if Biden gets in, three months ago, I got the sense from Clintonworld, that if Biden wants to get in gets, we can handle it and be fine. Even some people think it would make her a better candidate. I get the sense now that they feel vulnerable enough that the last thing they need is yet another hurdle. 
 
Sam Stein : Do they worry that if Biden gets in, it helps Sanders against them? 
 
Todd : That’s what our pole says. It makes sense. You have two sort of establishment figures and one outsider. At least in New Hampshire you can see how that almost guarantees Sanders. 
 
Stein : Two white men verses an historic female candidacy… 
 
Todd : You just put your finger on something. Historic female candidacy. Where is it? 
 
Stein : It’s overwhelmed by the email issue pretty much. 
 
Todd : That’s something, this is not, women are not galvanized. 
 
Kay : That’s really interesting. You aren’t picking up a wave of excitement from women voters around the candy is candidacy. In a way that you would have thought I would have guaranteed you that women would have been in the forefront of this campaign. 
 
Todd : I had a supporter of her who thinks actually maybe if Biden gets in all the sudden there’s a rally around her effect that that will be the thing that instead of firing up women in an optimistic way it sort of fires them up in oh my God we got to save her kind of way.

2292,"THERE'S nothing better than fresh herbs and vegetables from your own garden. With temperatures warming now's the time to start planning for produce such as lettuce, spinach, peas, zucchini, pumpkin, tomatoes and strawberries. 
 
 Step 1. Prepare the soil  
 
Before you plant any vegetables, prepare your garden beds by digging the soil and adding organic compost at least 1-2 weeks before you start planting. Most vegetables only need 15-20 centimetres of good soil for their roots to grow. If you're planning to grow crops with deeper roots, like potatoes or carrots, dig and compost deeper - up to 30 centimetres. Water-in the compost and let it break down before you plant your vegetables. To get the most out of your vegetable garden, choose vegetables that you will use and plant seasonally. 
 
 Step 2: Planting seeds  
 
Draw a line in the soil with your finger to the depth prescribed for your chosen vegetable seed. Sow seeds at the specified distance apart and cover with soil. Water well. 
   
 Step 3: Planting spinach  
 
Spinach is a good source of vitamin A and one of the healthiest sources of minerals and nutrients that you can grow. Gently remove the spinach plants from their container and separate each plant. Use the gardening trowel to dig a hole deep enough, so that the leaves are sitting just above the soil and cover the roots. Plant the rest of the spinach in a row, about 30 centimetres apart. 
 
 Step 4: Planting peas  
 
Peas are easy to grow and also help to improve the soil you're growing them in. Take each pea plant out of its container. Dig a hole deep enough for the peas, so the leaves are sitting just above the soil. Put the peas in the hole, and then fill it in. When planting your peas, remember that they will need some kind of support as they grow, so take that into account when working out the distance between them. Ideally they should be about 30 centimetres apart. 
 
 Step 5: Planting onions  
 
Onions are a popular vegetable because they are easy to grow and don't take up a lot of space in your garden. After taking the onion seedlings out of their container, separate each plant by gently washing them in a bucket of water to get rid of the soil. Separate each plant and dig a shallow trench. Plant each onion plant in the trench and cover the roots with soil. 
   
 Step 6: Fertilise your vegetable plants  
 
Vegetables need regular fertilising when they're growing. To give yours a good head start, and to help with the shock of being transplanted, dilute a seaweed concentrate, approximately two capfuls in 10 litres of water in a watering can. Soak your vegetables in this mixture. 
 
 Step 7: Apply mulch  
 
Mulch helps your plants grow in a number of ways. As it breaks down it will provide nitrogen to the soil and your plants, keep the roots cool in summer and stop weeds from growing in your vegetable garden. Apply the mulch around your vegetable plants but not touching them. If the mulch gets wet it can rot the plant. 
 
 Step 8: Water the vegetables  
 
To give your vegetable garden a good start, water the plants at least every day for the first few days. Then reduce the amount of water you give them, which will encourage the plant's roots to grow deeper as they look for water. This will also help the plant to grow, establish itself and produce home-grown food for your kitchen table.

Syrian refugees arrive in UK 

UK, London: Natalie Bennett MP of the Green party talks to a reporter. Thousands of people turned out for the Solidarity with Refugees march on September 12, 2015, at which the new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn MP also spoke. The march went from Marble Arch to Westminster, calling on the government to do more to help refugees fleeing from war in Syria to Europe. Corbyn made his inaugural speech as leader of the Labour party, having won the role earlier in the day. (AAP Image/NewZulu/Hugh unningham). 

London [AFP 

] 

Britain has welcomed the first of the 20,000 Syrian refugees that it has pledged to relocate from camps in countries neighbouring the war-torn nation, according to the government. 

‘Today a number of people have arrived in the UK as part of the Vulnerable Persons Resettlement scheme,’ said a Home Office statement on Tuesday. 

The government would not give details of how many refugees had arrived, or where in Britain they would be resettled. 

Under the expanded scheme, the new arrivals will receive housing, access to medical care and education and will be granted five years’ humanitarian protection. 

After that period they will be able to apply to stay in Britain. 

Prime Minister David Cameron announced earlier this month that Britain would take 20,000 refugees from camps in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey over the next five years after coming under fire for an apparent reluctance to take measures to ease the crisis sweeping Europe. 

Britain had accepted 216 Syrian refugees under the scheme before this month’s announcement and has granted asylum to almost 5,000 Syrians since the Syrian conflict broke out in 2011 – far fewer than countries like France, Germany and Sweden. 

European Union ministers on Tuesday pushed through a deal to relocate 120,000 refugees, but faced fierce opposition from central and eastern states. 

Britain is exempt from EU asylum and migration policy and Cameron had already made it clear that the country would not be involved in any quota system. 

Cameron visited Syrian refugee camps in Lebanon and Jordan last week, pledging increased aid which he said would help stem the migration crisis in Europe. 

The surprise visits, which included talks with Lebanon’s prime minister and the king of Jordan, came as Cameron appointed a minister to oversee the resettlement of the 20,000 refugees. 

Croatia urges Serbia to redirect migrants 

Meanwhile, Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic has urged Serbia to resume directing migrants to Hungary and Romania to help ease the burden on his own country. 

Milanovic told reporters it was still possible for refugees to be sent to Croatia, but ‘my message to them (Serbia) is … also to send them to Hungary, Romania.

7768,"I’ve written about this idea before, but I have to write more. This idea has been gnawing away at me because it is so important. 
 
Everything that you want for yourself has a price. You have to pay in advance for every goal that you set for yourself, and there is no way to cheat this iron law of success. Instead, just start making your payments. 
  If you want more money, you have to pay the price by studying how people generate income and wealth . You’ll also have to pay the price of creating value for other people, and the more money or wealth you want, the greater the value you need to create. Everyone wants more money, but very few are willing to pay the price to have it—especially when they discover how much hard work is required.  A lot of people want more customers or clients. They want to grow their business. But the price you have to pay to acquire new clients is paid in prospecting . You pay the price of learning to create a compelling value prop and dialing the telephone. “But Anthony,” you say, “I want the clients, but I hate cold calling!” The price is the same regardless of how you feel about cold calling.   
Right now I want better health and greater energy. I am paying the price of getting up at 5:00 AM to be at the gym with my trainer at 5:30 every day (even weekends). You have to pay the price of spending energy to create more energy. I had to pay the additional price of giving up my precious writing time, moving my writing to later in the day. I didn’t want to pay this price, but for about 60 days now, I have been making payments. 
 
And that’s how you do it. You pay the price a little at a time, day after day. Success has a payment plan. Once you pay the price in full, you have what you want. But not before you’ve paid the price.

6143,"ST. LOUIS   Kevin Siegrist, who got the save for the St. Louis Cardinals on Sunday, got saved by the Cardinals on offense on Monday night as they scored five runs in the seventh inning to get him off the hook for the loss and sent the Redbirds to an 8-5 win over the Washington Nationals at Busch Stadium. 
   
Siegrist, pitching in the seventh inning after serving as closer while Trevor Rosenthal was on paternity leave, gave up a three-run homer to Washington first baseman Ryan Zimmerman that put the Nationals up 5-3. But the Cardinals turned it around and extended their lead in the National League Central to five games as the month of September gets underway. 

The Cardinals sent 10 hitters to the plate in the seventh, with pinch hitter Greg Garcia's double play grounder almost doing them in. But the Cardinals followed that with six straight hitters reaching base and RBI hits from Stephen Piscotty, Jhonny Peralta (to tie), Jason Heyward (to take the lead) and Kolten Wong (for insurance). In the game, the Cardinals had 13 hits, 12 of them singles. 
 
Siegrist, who ended up getting the win to go to 6-1, almost made it out of the seventh. He walked the leadoff hitter but then retired the next two hitters he faced. After carefully walking MVP candidate Bryce Harper, Zimmerman uncorked a 3-1 pitch onto the hill behind center field. 

The Cardinals took a 3-1 lead in the fourth on a walk and four consecutive singles, but couldn't get any more runs in after having runners on first and second with one out. 

John Lackey struggled his way through six innings, allowing only two runs on four hits while striking out eight but needing 105 pitches to do it. He should have gotten through the first without allowing a run, but a fielding error by Wong extended the inning and Zimmerman doubled in a run. 

Rosenthal, back from paternity leave, got his 42nd save. He gave up singles to the first two hitters he faced, and then threw a wild pitch so hard off the backstop it came back to Yadier Molina, who caught Anthony Rendon off first and eventually tagged him out in what could best be described as a walkdown.

1855,"The beatification of Tshimangadzo Samuel Benedict Daswa, a school principal in Limpopo Province, is scheduled for September 13, an event described by Zuma as “momentous” and “historic”. 
 
 JACOB ZUMA “This is a significant moment for our country and indeed the African continent as a whole. Such ceremonies are extremely rare in the history of the Catholic Church. 
 
“This is the first ever beatification in Southern Africa. We are truly humbled that a South African is being honoured in this manner,” Zuma said. 
 
Daswa will from tomorrow be known as Blessed Benedict Daswa. 
 
Daswa was beaten, stoned and burnt to death for his beliefs on February 2, 1990, the very date on which then President FW de Klerk announced the release of Nelson Mandela, who later became South Africa’s first black president, and the unbanning of political organisations. 
 
“The beatification service will restore the dignity of Mr Daswa and inspire people all over the world to do good at all times even under extremely difficult situations,” Zuma said. 
 
Zuma said Daswa lost his life because he believed in human rights and dignity and did not support the persecution of fellow villagers on allegations of witchcraft. 
 
Many people, especially elderly women, have lost their lives due to accusations of witchcraft in some communities. 
 
“Such practices have no place in our country and we are happy that this is not widespread,” Zuma said. 
“May this ceremony remind all of the need to unite in fighting this dangerous practice of stigmatizing and condemning innocent people, especially women, due to gossip and innuendo,” Zuma said. 
 
Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will represent the government at the beatification ceremony which will be watched by millions of people in South Africa and beyond. 
 
The Catholic Church has described Daswa as a man who led a holy life, a diligent worker, a good family man, an industrious educator, an active layman, an avid sportsman, an involved community leader, a man of charity and, above all, a person of deep prayer and spirituality.  Enditem

9155,"Anti-gay Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is the subject and inspiration for a new lesbian erotic novel.

Author Lilith St. Augustine has shared that Davis inspired her to write Kim Goes To Jail: An Erotic Story in which a small town woman is sent to jail over a quarrel centering on “religious freedom” and gay rights. Upon entering the clink, “Kim” finds herself cellmates with a gorgeous woman who shows her how to loosen up and let her hair down.

Via the NY Daily News:
The NSFW book paints steamy images in the readers’ head of the changes Kim is experiencing behind bars.
“One day I’m standin’ on the side of the Lord against sexual perversion, and the next I’m in prison orange watchin’ a buck nekkid m—— vixen ’bout to do impure things to herself and to my soul in one single, terrifyin’ act,” the character says in the novel.

St. Augustine certainly nails Davis’ folksy twang. You can almost hear her self-righteous voice utter those words tinged with both self-hatred and excitement.

Speaking with The Huffington Post, St. Augustine remarked that she created the novella “to poke fun at [people who use religion to deny others their rights]” and also give “readers satisfaction not only in the typical erotica sense but also of seeing a character do some things that, in the real world, would obviously be anathema to the kinds of people we’re talking about.” An additional pleasure St. Augustine sought? “There can be pleasure in irony sometimes. And hopefully readers will get a chuckle or two while we’re at it.”

An eBook copy of this masterpiece can be yours for only $.99.

THE Te Awamutu-based honey firm has 37 shareholders, according to records on the Companies Office, with Waterman Capital a cornerstone owner. 
Founder Kerry Paul owns 7.3 per cent, while Milford Asset Management owns 6.3 per cent. The New Zealand Herald has reported the purchase price was $NZ110 million ($A97.97 million). Manuka Health was founded in 2006 and exports 90-plus products based on propolis, royal jelly, bee pollen, and manuka honey to 45 countries. It has annual turnover of more than $NZ50m. The deal comes after the company ruled out a public offer in June as it looked for funding for a global roll-out of new products said to boost the antibacterial qualities of manuka honey and its pipeline of research and development. ""PEP approached us really only a short time ago really and they worked very quickly at doing their due diligence and negotiating an agreement with us,"" Mr Paul told BusinessDesk. He would stay on as chief executive, and there would be no staff changes, he said. Asian demand for manuka honey has lifted the price for all New Zealand honey, amid a global honey shortage. New Zealand bees produced $NZ187 million of exported honey in the June 2014 year, up eight per cent by volume and almost 30 per cent by value on the previous year.

(businesspress24) - VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA -- (Marketwired) -- 09/28/15 --   Western Potash Corp. (TSX: WPX)(FRANKFURT: AHE) (the ""Western"", ""the Company"") is pleased to announce that subsequent to the closing of the strategic investment from Beijing Tairui Innovation Capital Management Ltd. (""Tairui""), announced September 16th of this year, Mr. Chang Xiaogang (Geoffrey) has been elected to the position of Executive Chairman of the Board of Western Potash Corp. 

Mr. Chang is a graduate of Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management with a Master''s Degree in Business Administration. Previously he served as President and Chairman of Shanxi Top Energy Company Ltd., Deputy Chairman of Shanxi Securities Ltd., Deputy Chairman of Shanxi Zhangze Power Company Ltd., Chairman and President of Shanxi International Power Group Ltd. Mr. Chang also served as a full-time independent director of SASAC, China''s State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. 

Patricio Varas, CEO commented,"" The Western Potash board is pleased to welcome Geoffrey Chang as newly elected Chairman. Mr. Chang and Tairui bring a wealth of relevant experience that will help guide Western as the Company begins the transition to project construction."" 

Environmental Assessment Approval: 

Western is also pleased to announce that it has received Environmental Assessment Approval from the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment (""SMoE"") for the Milestone Project Pilot Plant, (""the Pilot Plant""). Western submitted an Environmental Impact Statement (""EIS"") for the Milestone Project initially in early 2013 as the project was considered a ""Development"" as defined in the province of Saskatchewan''s Environmental Assessment Act (""EAA""). As such it was subject to an Environmental Impact Assessment. Following a regulatory review, the EIS received Ministerial Approval from SMoE in April 2013. 

Subsequently, Western re-scoped the project as detailed in the Scoping Study for a Scalable Pilot Plant delivered earlier this year and announced in the July 2nd, 2015 news release. The Milestone Project Pilot Plant by contrast provides an alternative methodology that employs lower capital using innovative selective potash solution mining techniques. The change in mining methodology and design proposed for the Pilot Plant required review under the EAA as it represented a change from the original 2013 approval. A Project Description outlining the Pilot Plant was submitted to SMoE in July, 2015. Following review of the Project Description, Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment concluded that the proposed change will not result in significant environmental impacts different from those identified in the original EIS and is satisfied that the requirements of the EAA have been met. 
   
ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 

Patricio Varas, President and CEO

5647,"ANKARA ( ) - Turkey attempted to convince the world to set up a safe zone inside Syria to stem the flow of refugees from the war-torn country, but nobody heard its voice, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on Friday. 

He was speaking at a meeting of G20 finance chiefs in Ankara, days after images of a drowned Syrian toddler washed up on a Turkish beach sparked renewed debate on how to tackle the migrant crisis. 

Turkish calls for Syria safe zone went unheard, Davutoglu says

4514,"Long, ugly tan socks held up at the thigh with an elastic band that cut off circulation kept my legs warm during the cold Nebraska winters when I was a kid. Not only were they uncomfortable, they caused problems on other fronts, especially when the elastic band slipped and the socks fell down around my ankles or worse yet, when a desperate rush for bathroom visit was called for because I played too long and the bulk of the socks got in the way of the job. 

Those miserable socks were part of my wardrobe until mid-adolescence when my mother finally bought me a pair of cotton slacks, Jeans didn’t enter the picture until I was in junior high, and then only to be worn on cold winter days. 

I still recall the sick feeling I had when I caught my new jeans on a barbed wire fence and tore a hole in the knee. Those were my jeans for the year, and I didn’t get another pair until the following fall. 
 
Even so, I didn’t wear those torn jeans after mother mended them. To have done so would have been socially degrading. It would have been as bad as today’s adolescent admitting he didn‘t understand social media. 

I didn’t wear my torn or even mended jeans because it was a sign that we may have been poor. Never mind that I had no idea what that meant in a small school where everybody was neither rich nor poor, just part of being. 

A few years ago a close friend told me she loves being around her teenage granddaughter, but she can’t help commenting on her torn jeans and sweatshirts with torn necklines and drooping cuffs. 
 
“I want to stand there and shout,” ‘Hey, she has a closet full of nice clothes. Her parents have good jobs. She doesn’t have to look like this’.” 

Now, the more torn, ripped, tattered looking, the more affluent appears the wearer. The look isn’t just reserved for the young. Today, the ragged edges, the holes in the seat, tears in the knees know no age, They are worn by the toddlers, adolescents, on dates, at social affairs, by celebrants and the elderly. 

Well, maybe not the elderly. Most likely they just haven’t taken the time to get rid of them. 

One thing is for certain. I bet you won’t ever catch any of them wearing ugly long cotton socks with elastic bands holding them up. But then, one never can be sure.",7216fcb6-e24a-437b-b6f4-e39d94bd55ec,News,2015-09-23T14:17:00Z,Hastings Tribune,"Tattered, torn and in fashion",0.0,News
1959,"byBrandon Hill—Thursday, September 24, 2015Microsoft Drops Bing For Baidu In China To Strengthen Windows 10 Adoption RateMicrosoft really wants you to use Bing. The company makes Bing a focal point of its new Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile operating system and even pays customers to use its search engine with Bing Rewards. The company has even received some flak for making Bing the default search engine in Windows 10 if they choose the Express upgrade options, since this overrode the user’s previous default search option. Bing has roughly 20 percent of the U.S. search engine market, and a little less than 11 percent of the global search engine market. In an effort to push Windows 10 growth in China, Microsoft’s isn’t going to try to force Bing upon users. Instead, it has teamed up with Chinese giant Baidu, making it the default search engine in Windows 10’s Edge browser. In addition, Microsoft will make Baidu.com the default homepage in Edge as well. Baidu has over 600 million active users globally, so Microsoft was wise to concede on this front. And given Baidu’s dominance in China, it makes sense to play to a home audience. “Together, we will make it easy for Baidu customers to upgrade to Windows 10 and we will deliver a custom experience for customers in China, providing local browsing and search experiences,” said Microsoft’s Yusuf Mehdi. “We remain deeply committed to delivering Bing around the world and we’re also committed to offering locally relevant experiences – like Baidu in China – to provide great Windows 10 experiences.” In addition, Microsoft is hoping that more Chinese users will abandon the piracy route in order to purchase a genuine copy of Windows 10. So Microsoft is also giving its blessing for Baidu “Windows 10 Express”, which is Baidu’s official Windows 10 distribution channel. And to top things off, Baidu will also provide Universal Windows Apps for Search, Cloud, Video and Maps in Windows 10. At last official count, Windows 10 had been installed on 75 million computers around the world. Within the next two to three years, Microsoft wants that figure to balloon to over one billion. Partnerships like this one with Baidu are key to making that lofty figure a reality. Tags: Microsoft, China, Bing, Baidu, Windows 10, (nasdaq:msft), microsoft edgeVia: Microsoft blog comments powered by Disqus",5ccb3b56-467b-4c3f-8cd2-f3c07e9829bf,Blog,2015-09-24T11:25:00Z,HotHardware.com News Rss Feed,Microsoft Drops Bing For Baidu In China To Strengthen Windows 10 Adoption Rate,1.0,News
7267,"I’m a late bloomer. Probably because I spent a majority of my life being afraid. I spent a majority of my life caring to much what people think of me. I spent a majority of my life waiting for other people to give me permission or affirmation to do the things I felt called to do. I spent a majority of my life feeling insecure and comparing myself to others. So I bloomed a little later than some. 
 
I think a lot of women struggle with this. I have had enough conversations with other wallflowers who are struggling to bloom because they keep themselves hidden from the light of truth and the water of nourishment in accepting who they are. 
 
They compare their gifts. They compare their ability to be a good mother. They compare their love stories. They listen to “what ifs” and “what if nots”. They cannot accept their uniqueness. They look to where they are not yet, so they stop and stunt their growth. 
 
They wait and wonder – when will the insecurities go away? When will the fear erase? When will the comparing stop? 
 
When will someone else give me enough confidence to be…me? 
 
On our property we have several franji panji plants also known as Plumerias. About 350 days a year they look like a stick. These tall sticks if you will appear lifeless, brown and sort of barren. But then when it’s the right time, they bloom. They bloom pink with a yellow center, sometimes purple and white and most fragrant cocoa butter smell you have ever inhaled. 
 
They are strung together on Hawaiian leis, given as crowns upon a brides head and are offered for special occasions as bouquets. 
 
I thought about these incredible petals, these slow growing plants and how they don’t apologize for blooming once a season. They don’t apologize for their appearance when they aren’t in full bloom. They don’t wait for other trees or plants or shrubs to tell them what they are. They know their beauty and for what they are created to do and become. 
 
They come forth when it’s their time and do what only they can do. 
 
Beautifully displayed. Timely. Unique. Fragrant. 
 
Aren’t these things we as women of God’s creation are called to be? 
 
Beautifully displayed. 
 
“Oaks of righteousness, 
a planting of the Lord 
for the display of his splendor.” Isaiah 61:3 
 
Timely. 
 
“He has made everything beautiful in its time.” Ecclesiastes 3:11 
 
Unique. 
 
“I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well. 
My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place, 
when I was woven together in the depths of the earth. 
Your eyes saw my unformed body; 
all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.” Psalm 139:15-16

But we forget. We hide the beauty within, afraid that we are not enough. We deny that we are special, suppress that which is unique and underestimate the time of which we are to bloom. 
 
We cover our fragrance with insecurity and fear. We wait for someone to give us permission to be who we are. We rob the world of knowing Christ through the uniqueness of our own life experience, our own unique story, our own fragrance. 
 
I love the franji panji – it will forever be my favorite flower. I love that this delicate flower reminds me of the fragile earthen clay that I am made of holds endless treasure and beauty. 
 
I love that the sunset center of it’s design reminds me of the beauty of the one who created it and that the same created me to also be on display for His glory. 
 
I love how it reminds me that everything is beautiful in it’s time and that my being is created with a timely purpose. 
 
I love how it reminds me not to try to look or be like someone else but to be and live the truth of Psalm 139. 
 
I love that the fragrance reminds me to be a fragrant, a sweet smelling offering unto Him. 
 
Maybe you too need to be reminded that you are beautiful, unique, timely, special and fragrant. 
 
Don’t wait for creation to tell you who you are or who you should be, be who the Creator called you to be.",8417764c-25d7-497c-b6eb-92f26683ec6a,Blog,2015-09-24T18:00:40Z,98.5 KTIS,Bloom,1.0,Blog

5192,"View image | gettyimages.com At this point, I'm assuming you've already drafted your fantasy teams for the 2015 NFL season. Did you miss out on the IDP you wanted? Does your team look weak at one of the IDP position groups? Maybe you waited on LB to snag J.J. Watt? Maybe you went best player available and ended up with some low ceiling players at the DB position? Fear not! I've got your lottery ticket right here. Following are some players from each position group who may not have been drafted at all in your league who I feel are flying under the radar and are prepped for big seasons. Dump one of your low ceiling guys and take a chance on one of these fellas. Defensive Backs Bradley McDougald - S - TB The third year McDougald racked up 36 solo tackles over the final 6 games of the 2014 season. 36! Now the full time starter at free safety for the Bucs, this guy is primed for a HUGE year. If we extrapolate last year's numbers to a full season, that's over 90 tackles! You can also expect a handful of interceptions to be sprinkled in. I don't think the ceiling is super high for this guy, but I do think you will get a steady stream of tackles throughout the season. Drop one of your more high-variance DBs and take a chance on Bradley stepping up his game even further. Travis Carrie - CB - OAK The Raiders cut Trindon Holliday. You know what that means, right? We've got a full-time CB who returns both KICKS and PUNTS! Not often are we seeing that in today's NFL, compared to days past. If your league grants return yardage points, then I'm assuming Adam Jones may have already been selected. Well, joke's on that owner, as Pac Man Jones is no longer returning kickoffs this year. If you drafted Jones expecting last year's production, I highly suggest dropping Jones and adding Carrie. I'm also guessing Carrie will chip in with about 55 tackles this season. Defensive Linemen Jacquies Smith - DE - TB Already a favorite of Tampa Bay beat writers, Smith is a sure to find his way into the hearts of those fantasy owners in sack-heavy leagues. If you missed out on a top-tier DE in a sack heavy league, I think I may have found an adequate replacement for you. After bouncing around the NFL for his first couple seasons, Smith started 7 games for the Buccaneers last season and recorded 6.5 sacks. He flashed serious dominance View image | gettyimages.com and all reports are that that trend is going to continue. Demarcus Lawrence - DE - DAL A lot of the focus on the Dallas Cowboys defensive line has been aimed at controversial 2015 2nd round draft pick Randy Gregory and the ""troubled"" Greg Hardy. Let's not forget Lawrence, who was drafted in the 2nd round of the 2014 draft, but suffered an injury in training camp that caused him to miss valuable development and playing time. Now, the broken foot is all healed up. Furthermore, Lawrence had a strong showing in the playoff last year and is looking to build on that success. But wait, there's more! He's being moved to the left side this season, as Gregory and Hardy are both natural right ends. Did I fail to mention that Lawrence loves rushing from the left edge? If that doesn't scream ""Breakout!"", I don't know what does. Linebackers Alex Okafor - LB - ARI The Will linebacker in Arizona's 3-4 scheme, Okafor is going to do a lot of things this season for the Cardinals. The thing I'm most excited about are his sack numbers. In 12 games last year, he recorded 8 sacks. His tackle numbers weren't the greatest, but I expect that to rise this year. Okafor has had to fight hard to stay on the Card's roster, and I believe that drive is really going to pay off this year. The coaching staff loves him, and he's been a beast so far against opposing one's in the preseason. Okafor is a player who has shown steady growth since an injury kept him off the field nearly his entire rookie season two years ago and the early part of last year. His production has been sporadic, but when he has showed up it has been a sight to see. I expect more consistency from him this year in what is essentially his sophomore season. Bonus   Jabaal Sheard - DE - NE The Patriots were high on Sheard when Cleveland selected him in the 2011 NFL Draft. How things would have been different for Jabaal... It's a bit sad to imagine. Instead of Sheard, the Patriots ended up with Chandler Jones and Rob Ninkovich bookending their defensive line. Needless to say, the Pats probably didn't regret missing out on Jabaal as much as Jabaal wished he was drafted by New England. Stuck in Cleveland, Sheard's numbers have gone down each season since his first. But you can hardly blame the guy; he was on horrible teams that changed defensive schemes numerous times. He was moved around unnaturally and stifled when his talent would have been surely maximized by the likes of New England. Well, he's there now and although he's behind Rob and Chandler he will see playing time. Do you like taking chances? If you do, here is your super sleeper IDP. He's one injury away from beasting all over opposing offensive lines.",0e5117bb-6027-4b6a-aa69-a31e80c0f9e6,Blog,2015-09-10T11:59:47Z,We Talk Fantasy Sports,2015 Fantasy Football IDP Sleepers,1.0,Blog

This morning's class was kinda special. There were a fewer number of people there than usual. So I decided to take a little different approach to the Threshold Ride today. We did the warm up. We worked hard to set our thresholds for the usual 3-minute period. But then, I went to each person in class, face to face, and asked them what was one thing they would like to specifically work on in class this morning. I gave everyone the option to opt-out if they wanted, but everyone participated! And it was an amazing experience! I LOVED the input! I had people say they wanted to work on their endurance. I had some say they wanted to work on their power. Some said they wanted to work on their bodies. I had one woman say that wanted to focus on her ""me"" time. I followed that up by asking her if she had kids. Yes, she did. A toddler and an infant less than a year old. Oh I get it! I totally get it! I even had someone say that they wanted to work on showing the guy that broke up with them yesterday what they were missing! Yes! It is that focus on yourself, because a workout is truly just that, time to work on yourself. It is so important to take the time to provide yourself with that ""me"" time. To improve and strengthen yourself. To change your mental feeling and outlook. To change your physical body in a way that will make you feel better about you! And it can happen right here in the Ride with Tommy! @crunchgym Crunch Fitness - Sunset. But you have to take the time. And often it is not easy. But life is all about balance. You can give and give of yourself for hours and hours at a time during the day...to your kids...your significant other...your boss...your co-workers...your friends. But unless you take the time to commit to being the best you that you can be, then you won't be able to give the others in your life the best you either! So which do you want to do?

President Barack Obama weighed in on House Speaker John Boehner's (R-Ohio) resignation Friday, praising him as a ""good man"" and urging his successor to avoid a government shutdown. 

Obama, noting that the resignation took him by surprise, said he spoke to Boehner on the phone after hearing the news. 

""John Boehner is a good man,"" Obama said. ""He is a patriot, he cares deeply about the House, an institution in which he has served for a long time, he cares about his constituents and he cares about America."" 

Obama continued: ""We obviously have had a lot of disagreements, and politically we're at different ends of the spectrum, but I will tell you he has always conducted himself with courtesy and civility with me. He has kept his word when he has made a commmitment. He is somebody who has been gracious, and I think maybe most importantly is somebody who understands that in governance, you don't get 100 percent of what you want, but you have to work with people who you disagree with, sometime strongly, in order to do the people's business."" 

Obama said he would not ""prejudge"" the next House speaker and what his relationship might be like with him or her, but warned Boehner's future replacement against shutting down the government. 

""My hope is there's a recognition on the part of the next speaker, something I think John understood though at times it was challenging to bring his caucus along, that we can have significant differences on issues but that doesn't mean you shut down the government, that doesn't mean you risk the full faith and…",f8a65c25-08bb-4b1a-b0a3-9f7994eb33a3,News,2015-09-25T17:26:14Z,MyInforms,Obama Praises John Boehner For His Service Despite 'Disagreements',0.0,Blog

842,"Manny P. here… 
 
   Yogi Berra (right)  was the Baseball Hall of Fame catcher renowned as much for his malapropisms as his record ten World Series championships with the New York Yankees . He helped the team reach it 14 times  during his 18 seasons in the Bronx, playing in more  Fall Classic games than any other major leaguer; and was a three-time American League Most Valuable Player . But, his name appears almost as often in Bartlett’s Famous Quotations as it does in baseball’s record book. 
 
   In 1943, his first professional season with the Yankees’ farm team in Norfolk, Va., was interrupted by World War II. He joined the Navy, and later served on a gunboat supporting the D-Day invasion. 
 
    Berra played for the Yankees from 1949-65. His teammates included fellow Hall of Famers Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, and Whitey Ford. In 1956, he caught the only perfect game in World Series history and after the last out, he leaped into pitcher Don Larsen’s arms. The moment was captured in photographs, published in newspapers around the world. Berra, who played in 15 straight All-Star Games , never earned more than $65,000 a season. 
 
   After he retired, Berra coached or managed the Yankees, New York Mets , and Houston Astros . He led both the Yankees and the Mets to pennants. In 1985, his firing as manager by the Yankees 16 games into the season sparked a feud with George Steinbrenner. Berra vowed never to return to Yankee Stadium as long as Steinbrenner owned the team. He finally relented, throwing out the ceremonial first pitch of the Yankees’ season-opening game in 1999. 
 
   Berra published three books: his autobiography in 1961, It Ain’t Over… in 1989, and The Yogi Book: I Really Didn’t Say Everything I Said  in 1998. The last made the New York Times’  Best Seller list. In 1996, Berra was awarded an honorary doctorate from the state university in Montclair, N.J., where he and his family lived. The university also named its baseball stadium for Berra. The adjoining Yogi Berra Museum opened two years later. The museum houses Berra memorabilia, including what he said was his most prized possession, the mitt he used to catch Larsen’s perfect game. 
 
    He was a fan favorite, especially with kids, and the cartoon character Yogi Bear was named after him. He recently delighted television viewers by bringing his malapropisms to a commercial with the AFLAC duck. 
 
Yogi Berra was an American original. He was 90.

3677,"Anna Meares, a proud Maroons and Cowboys fan, is too diplomatic to reveal what she really thought of Paul Gallen before the call. 

The world's greatest NRL quiz #5Vote for the MVPs of 2015NRL Finals previews: Week 2

Anna Meares, a proud Maroons and Cowboys fan, is too diplomatic to reveal what she really thought of Paul Gallen before the call. ""I'd rather not say,"" said Australia's champion cycling star, perhaps only half-jokingly.

""Although I must admit that opinion was only driven by media and a biased Queensland background.""

That all changed after Gallen phoned her. Not to the point where she will barrack for Cronulla instead of North Queensland when the Sharks travel to Townsville for Saturday night's elimination final. But the respect Gallen showed Meares by dialling her number is now being reciprocated.

As part of his penance for that infamous tweet aimed at the NRL - on top of $35,000 financial penalty - Gallen had to interview three sportspeople he admired as part of a leadership course. There would have been few surprises when he turned to Sydney Swans star Adam Goodes and former Australian cricketer Steve Waugh. But there initially seemed few career parallels in his decision to choose Meares, a female Maroons fan whose sport of choice couldn't be any further removed from his own. But if he was looking for a role model, someone capable of bouncing back from adversities such as a broken neck during an Olympic year, then the exercise proved more reward than punishment.

""I spoke to Paul about the twitter stuff and the social side of life,"" Meares said. ""You have to take care when you have a profile and level of responsibility. Being a role model as well, you can't choose what you like and dislike in being a sportsperson for Australia, you've got to accept all the aspects of it. For me, I've never done it for profile or money, because it's very hard to get any. But I'm proud of my history of my consistency, of the relationship I have with the Australian public. Of the following I have, of the public nature of my career and the manner in which I've done it.

""At the same time I find it very daunting. I have to be really careful with who I surround myself. I need to be careful not to put myself into a situation where I'm uncomfortable or I'm in a situation where it can come back to bite me. I only drink casually or socially around people who I very much trust, close friends and family. It's that sort of thing. Some people call that a sacrifice, but that's not a sacrifice in my book. It's just a hard decision. A sporting person's lifetime is built up of difficult decisions.""

Meares, who herself was mentored by Waugh in the lead up to the London Olympics, officially became the greatest female track cyclist in history when she won an 11th gold medal earlier this year. She explained to Gallen that her consistency, which will result in a fourth Olympic games campaign in Rio, was the result of overcoming adversity.

""Setbacks, challenges and hurdles - whatever you want to call them - come in all different forms,"" she said.

""They can come in a physical, psychological or behavioural sense. It can be emotional, it can come in many different ways. Resilience is the main key, that vulnerability to put yourselves into positions in which you can fail, but also succeed, while having a grounded, humble nature as well.

""That combination [culminates in having] one chance every four years at an Olympic Games, which is very different from Paul's background where it's a hard grind season in and season out.

""I think he was quite an admirer of the planning structure and dedication required to focus on that one chance.""

Gallen will perhaps never have a better chance of creating history by leading Cronulla to its maiden premiership. While Meares has taken a special interest in the veteran forward since their unexpected chat, she'll be happy for him to play well in a well-beaten side this weekend.

""I give him credit for picking up the phone and asking a complete stranger in a totally different sport and respecting the fact I'm a female athlete,"" she said. ""It's wonderful and quite flattering."" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.",7fde1b48-3247-4921-9d4e-a14398243695,News,2015-09-16T10:00:00Z,Ballarat Courier,Gal pal: Why Cronulla Sharks skipper Paul Gallen turned to Olympian Anna Meares,0.0,Blog

1627,"A few extra years in the workforce – including in part-time work – can boost incomes in retirement significantly, writes Clancy Yeates. 
  
Working for longer is worth thinking about. Photo: Glen Hunt  
   
Treasurer Joe Hockey is urging more Australians to continue working until later in life, and it seems some are taking his advice. But putting aside what Hockey may think, experts say working for longer, including  in a part-time job, can have a surprisingly big impact on retirement income. 
 
Subscribe to Money’s weekly newsletter , delivered to your inbox every Wednesday 
  
Rising  numbers of Baby Boomers are deciding to extend their working life, official figures show. 
 
The proportion of 60 to 64-year-olds in the labour force has jumped from 45 per cent in 2008 to about 55 per cent today, and more people aged 65 and over are working, too. 
 
Part-time work is also becoming more common.The share of people aged over 55 in part-time work has risen from 35 per cent to 37 per cent, as shown in the graph from the Commonwealth Bank. 
 
No doubt this is encouraging news for Hockey and the Treasury boffins, who are nervously eyeing the mounting cost of medical care and pensions as the population ages. 
 
However, working for longer can also make financial sense for an individual. 
 
That is because a few extra years in the workforce – including in part-time work – can boost incomes in retirement significantly. 
 
Working for longer lifts retirement income in two main ways. It allows you to save up a larger sum of money – such as by making extra contributions to superannuation. Plus, it means the spending of your retirement savings is spread over fewer years. 
 
The head of retirement income solutions at Towers Watson, Nick Callil​, uses the hypothetical example of someone who is 60, and is thinking about retiring. 
 
If they retire at 60, they'd be converting their super savings into an income stream of about $32,500 a year. Working for another two years would lift this significantly. 
 
""If that person retires at age 62 rather than 60, the income goes up to about $34,600, which is a 6.6 per cent increase,"" he says. 
 
The numbers Callil sets out take into account the age pension's means test, which pares back the pension payments  our  hypothetical worker gets. 
 
But what about part-time work? 
 
Callil says that as workers get older, the bigger impact on retirement savings comes from delaying drawing down on your pool of savings, rather than the extra money you contribute to savings. So, working part-time can still give retirement savings a healthy boost. 
 
Of course, plenty of people don't want to work longer. And it's not always a matter of choice: some can't because of the physical toll of labour-intensive work. But the figures suggest that if it's possible, and a priority, it can lift your income later on. 
 
""What these numbers show is that in terms of self-provision and the system working for you, as against being forced to keep working, it's worth thinking about if you're capable of doing it,"" Callil says.

325,"School can be difficult. But are you encouraging or hindering your child's success? Here are 10 habits you may not realize are damaging to his or her success in school. 1. Forget about tomorrow morning. Let her stay up late! It’s not like she needs a full nights’ rest to do well in school; she can sleep in her desk! Besides, she hates bedtime and it’s so much easier to let her stay up with you and watch some of those funny late night television shows. 2. Don’t ask her about her homework every day or how school is going. You don’t want to be a nag. She’s probably got it all figured out and will get great grades without your getting involved. 3. Don’t worry about grades until a week or two before they come out. You have plenty of time! Your schedule is too busy anyway to be bogged down with your child’s education. If she misses class or a few assignments here and there, the teacher will gladly accept them until the last day of the term and if he doesn’t, you can just call the principal and she’ll sort it all out. 4. Yell at your child until she gets her homework done. Ground her and take away her cell phone. That’s how you really get someone motivated to work hard. If she complains, tell her you walked to school uphill both ways in the snow with no shoes; she’ll quickly realize that she’s being ungrateful and get right to work. 5. Don’t worry about attending Parent-Teacher Conference. That teacher couldn’t have anything helpful to say about how she is doing in his class. After all, what did he do with his life? He’s just a teacher. He better just shape up and do what you say, after all; you’re the parent and you pay taxes. 6. Whenever she has a doctor or dentist appointment, be sure to make that appointment during her hardest class. It will give her a much needed break and it’s not like you’re worried about her making up the work. That’s the teacher’s problem, not yours. 7. Don’t worry about whether your child has breakfast before she heads to school. School is early enough; it’s not worth getting up earlier to make breakfast. Besides, it’s not like learning is a bodily function; it’s more of a brain function. Page 2 of 2 - 8. Don’t praise your child if she does something well in school; it will just go to her head. Your job is to motivate her by pointing out only the things she does wrong. After all, if you don’t say it, who will? 9. If you have a complaint, always go straight to the top! Principals love to get involved in every little situation; that’s why they’re called princi-“pals.” 10. Don’t worry about setting a good example of continued learning. You already went to school! Been there, done that. You have too much work to do now to fit in reading a good book or showing your child that you still love art. Never talk about what inspired you to get where you are today; that will just bore her.",29d9ebb9-8196-4701-a431-0edd1645723f,News,2015-09-19T03:18:47Z,Canton Repository,10 ways you're helping your child fail in school and don't even realize it,0.0,News

The architecture automatically and dynamically adapts radio access and core network resources to meet the needs of different services, traffic variations over time and location, and network topology, including transport. 
 
Nokia said the service will up the quality of customer experiences and transform the business processes of industry sectors from manufacturing to automotive and healthcare. Operators will be able to offer network functions to any kind of industry under a Network-as-a-Service business model. 
 
Nokia's architecture uses a 'system of systems' approach to integrate and align the many different and independent parts of a network to achieve higher performance and more functionality as compared to today's networks. Nearly all network functions will become software-defined, cognitive technologies will automatically orchestrate the network, and content and processing will be distributed across the network close to where they are needed.

3950,"LEIDEN, the Netherlands, Sept. 14, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ProQR Therapeutics N.V. ( NASDAQ:PRQR ) today announced that PQ-010-002 is open for enrollment. The primary objective of PQ-010-002 is to estimate the effect of topical administration of QR-010 on the nasal mucosa in the restoration of CFTR function, as measured by Nasal Potential Difference (NPD). PQ-010-002 is an open-label, exploratory study evaluating the effect of QR-010 in ∆F508 homozygous (carry two allelic copies) and compound heterozygous (carry one copy of the ∆F508 mutation and one other disease causing mutation) cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. QR-010 is a novel investigational RNA therapeutic designed to repair the genetic mutation in the mRNA of CF patients due to the ∆F508 mutation. 

""We are excited to announce that the second clinical study of QR-010 is now open and enrolling,"" said Noreen R. Henig, MD, Chief Development Officer of ProQR. ""This study is an important proof-of-concept study that will test the activity of QR-010 in the treatment of CF. In animal models of CF, QR-010 showed the ability to restore CFTR mediated NPD to normal or wild-type levels. Repeating the same test in individuals with CF will provide an important first signal of the therapeutic potential of QR-010."" 
   
PQ-010-002 is a 28-day study conducted in up to 5 sites located in the US and Europe that are experienced in conducting NPD measurements. NPD is a well-accepted diagnostic test for CF and recently has been used to assess therapeutic benefit in clinical trials of investigational agents. The study will enroll at least 16 people with CF that are either homozygous or compound heterozygous for the ∆F508 mutation. NPD and sweat chloride measurements will be done before and after local treatment in the nose with QR-010 three times a week for four weeks. 

""RNA-based therapeutics are a novel approach to the treatment of the gene mutations that cause CF. The preclinical nasal potential difference studies of QR-010 in the mouse models of CF are quite compelling. The proof-of-concept study of QR-010 will support the understanding of QR-010's impact on CFTR function in patients with CF with the common ∆F508 CFTR mutation,"" said John P. Clancy, Professor of Pediatrics and Research Director, Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Cincinnati Children's Hospital and a member of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutic Development Network's leadership team. 

PQ-010-002 will be conducted in parallel with PQ-010-001, the ongoing Phase 1b safety and tolerability study of QR-010 in CF patients homozygous for the ∆F508 mutation. In addition to safety and tolerability, PQ-010-001 will assess pharmacokinetics and exploratory clinical efficacy endpoints. In the Phase 1b study, QR-010 is delivered to the lungs via inhalation. 

""We are very proud of our teams that have moved QR-010 from an interesting idea to two enrolling clinical studies in just three years,"" said Daniel A. de Boer, Chief Executive Officer of ProQR. ""We are committed to bringing important new therapies to patients with CF and these studies are important steps in understanding the potential of QR-010."" 

About CF 

CF is a genetic disease that affects an estimated 70,000 to 100,000 patients worldwide and causes early morbidity and mortality. CF currently has no cure. The median age of death for CF patients is 27, and more than 90% of CF patients die from respiratory failure. CF is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes for a protein called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR. For some patients with specific CF mutations, there are therapies available that aim to treat the basic defect of the disease. For many patients however, more efficacious medicines are needed because a substantial unmet medical need remains. The ∆F508 mutation that we are targeting is the most prevalent and is present in approximately 70% of all CF patients. In people with CF, this mutated gene and the resulting defective protein lead to the dysfunction of multiple organ systems, including the lungs, pancreas and gastrointestinal tract. In the lung airways, absence of functional CFTR protein leads to unusually thick, sticky mucus that clogs the lungs and increases vulnerability to chronic, life-threatening lung infections. 

About QR-010 

QR-010 is a first-in-class RNA-based oligonucleotide designed to address the underlying cause of the disease by repairing the mRNA defect encoded by the ∆F508 mutation in the CFTR gene of CF patients. The ∆F508 mutation is a deletion of three of the coding base pairs, or nucleotides, in the CFTR gene, which results in the production of a misfolded CFTR protein that does not function normally. QR-010 is designed to bind to the defective CFTR mRNA and guide the insertion of the three missing nucleotides, thus repairing the mRNA and subsequently producing wild-type, or normal CFTR protein. QR-010 is designed to be self-administered through a small, handheld aerosol delivery device, or nebulizer, in the form of a mist inhaled into the lungs. We believe this method could allow maximum exposure of QR-010 to the primary target organ, the lung, as well as significant exposure to other affected organs through systemic absorption into the blood. QR-010 has been granted orphan drug designation in the United States and the European Union.

In 2011 she caught the attention of the inimitable King Khan at a karaoke bar (he also lives in Berlin), and she recorded what's still her most recent full-length of new material, 2013's Eden, at his Moon Studios. He's not her only famous fan either: Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs contributed a quote to Ocher's press kit. ""Mary Ocher gives me the chills,"" she says. ""She frightens me with her feral soul. Her sound is of a true outsider artist, immaculately self-possessed. Was this recorded this century? Or out of a basement that's she's been imprisoned all her life?""
Her DIY roots and anything-goes aesthetic notwithstanding, Ocher is obviously too well-connected to qualify as an outsider. And she's definitely not locked in a basement—tonight at 10 PM, she plays a free show at Analogue in Logan Square as part of a solo North American tour. 
""Baby Indiana,"" the only track from Eden with a video, injects its acoustic dance trance with a vaguely Middle Eastern flavor. Ocher's broad vibrato and wildly slewing pitch center make her piercing voice sound giddy and a little loopy, but she uses the occasional dramatic overenunciation of a terminal consonant to ground it in an aura of ritual pronouncement.
In March of this year, Ocher released a digital-only two-volume collection of home recordings dating back to 2006. The Fictional Biography of Mary Ocher covers a dizzying amount of ground for music that sounds like it was made in a broom closet: its backing tracks include ghostly noise, sad but jaunty piano, frisky strumming, echoing ersatz funk, chintzy drum machine with vacuum-cleaner synth, and aimlessly gnawing distorted electric guitar. Ocher herself seems to have as many faces as a vaudeville performer: her multifarious singing leaps without warning from unhinged keening to warped drawling or from wobbly muttering to blustery declaiming.
Among tonight's openers is Gel Set, aka Laura ""Lulu"" Callier; I reviewed her first full-length, Human Salad, on the occasion of its release party in July. Ocher will be selling copies of a second edition of Eden, both on golden cassette tapes and on vinyl.",d61b0b74-ff62-491d-9b48-e0cd79b5d8fc,Blog,2015-09-10T17:00:00Z,Chicago Reader,Self-described 'outsider torch singer' Mary Ocher performs at Analogue tonight,1.0,News

Die Wolfe went into the half-time break with a 1-0 lead thanks to a 26th-minute Daniel Caligueri strike. 

However, Robert Lewandowski single-handedly dismantled Wolfsburg with five goals in nine minutes after coming on as a substitute at half-time.

""We had a good first half, kept Bayern at a distance from our goal and took the lead, but didn’t have the luck on our side with Guilavogui’s shot against the post.  

""What happened then is unexplainable - but it must be said, conceding five goals in nine minutes is not acceptable! We shouldn’t have conceded the 1-2 directly after the 1-1.

575,"Days before a stop in Cuba on his way to the United States, Pope Francis on Thursday told young people from both countries that government heads who fail to plant the seeds of future leadership are ""worthless ... dictators."" 
 
Francis, who was elected in 2013, has been credited for being the chief advocate for renewing diplomatic ties between Washington and Havana. 

The Pope on Thursday responded from the Vatican to questions from students in Havana and New York during a CNN en Español teleconference on his Scholas initiative, which seeks to bring young people together via sports, art and technology. The event was held in partnership with the United Nations Children's Fund. 

Asked by a Cuban student about the example of his leadership, Francis said, ""I will tell you one thing, a good leader is one who is capable of bringing up other leaders. If a leader wants to lead alone, he is a tyrant. True leadership is fruitful. Each one of you has the seed of leadership."" 

He added, ""The leaders of today will not be here tomorrow. If they do not plant the seed of leadership in others, they are worthless. They are dictators."" 

Francis, the first pope from Latin America, earned praise from both U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro for helping restart relations between the neighboring countries. 

In July, the two countries reopened embassies in Havana and Washington. 

Pope Francis' whirlwind tour to Cuba and the United States begins Saturday, when he arrives in Havana for a trip that includes mass at Revolution Square, a meeting with government officials and a visit to the Shrine of Our Lady of Charity del Cobre, the island's patron saint. 

The Pope will be the third consecutive leader of the Roman Catholic Church to visit Cuba. St. John Paul II stopped there for several days in 1998, and Pope Benedict XVI visited for three days in 2012. 

Relations between the Vatican and Cuba, strained during the 49-year rule of communist dictator Fidel Castro, have improved since the younger Castro replaced his sickly brother as president. 

Cuba was officially atheist from 1962-1992, and an annual State Department report issued last year said religious activity there is only allowed ""if explicitly authorized"" by the government. The Catholic Church estimates between 60% and 70% of Cubans are baptized. 

Another Cuban student Friday urged the Pope to remember the poor and marginalized and to pray for a lifting of the longstanding U.S. embargo against Cuba. 

Francis said he would do ""all that is possible"" to ""build bridges"" and foster communication leading to friendship.

3481,"Blood pressure drug Ramipril was found to be safe. But then an investigation found trial data was fabricated. 

The research of a promising Australian scientist has been retracted after an investigation found she faked results in the trial of a blood pressure drug.

Dr Anna Ahimastos was a researcher at the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne when she fabricated data that was published in two international journals.

On Tuesday, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)retracted Dr Ahimastos' paper on a three-year clinical trial of a blood pressure drug, Ramipril. The study found the drug, a safe and effective treatment for lowering blood pressure, also helped patients with artery disease walk for longer and with less pain.

While the study has been retracted, Baker IDI said participants involved in the trial were not exposed to any danger. Subsequent studies also suggest the original finding may still be correct.

In June, another Baker IDI researcher noticed inconsistencies in the original study data, which promoted an internal investigation.

Bronwyn Kingwell, the head of the laboratory where Dr Ahimastos worked, said during the investigation Dr Ahimastos admitted to making up data about several patients that did not exist. She resigned in July.

A note from the paper's other authors to the JAMA journal editors said Dr Ahimastos was the person ""responsible for data collection and integrity for the article"".

""No other coauthors were involved in this misrepresentation,"" the note read.

""All authors recognise the seriousness of this issue and apologise unreservedly to the editors, reviewers and readers of JAMA.""

Professor Kingwell said while data collected from study participants in Melbourne had been compromised, the information gathered from patients in Townsville and Brisbane was credible.

""What we hope to do in the fullness of time is reanalyse that data independently and get a research finding from that,"" she said.

A smaller subsequent trial also found that ramipril improves patient with walking time.

Professor Kingwell said while this was an isolated event, the institute was reviewing its practices around how investigators report study data and results to prevent this type of incident recurring.

She said Dr Ahimastos had a PhD, 10 years of experience and was trained in good clinical practice, making her well qualified for the job.

""We work in a high-trust environment as a team and each individual has serious responsibilities,"" Professor Kingwell said. ""Unfortunately [in this instance] the individual who breached [this trust] was the one who had responsibility for the data collection.""

In 2010 Dr Ahimastos was honoured with a Young Tall Poppy Science Award by the Australian Institute of Policy and Science.

Another of Dr Ahimastos' papers, published in the journal Circulation Research, has also been retracted.

""We are currently investigating other studies for which Dr Ahimastos had oversight of data collection,"" Professor Kingwell said.

Fairfax Media tried to contact Dr Ahimastos, but was unsuccessful.

4306,"A former property developer has spent eight years and a huge sum of money to see a hit play become an Australian film. 

More on Holding The Man​Movie session timesFull movies coverage

It could be the biggest punt in Australia this weekend, racetracks and casinos included.

Former property developer Cameron Huang has more than $1 million of his own money riding on how director Neil Armfield's gay romance Holding the Man opens in cinemas then sells around the world.

Huang, 43, knew nothing about the film industry when he saw Tommy Murphy's play of the same name, based on Tim Conigrave's memoir about his 15-year relationship with former schoolmate John Caleo, eight years ago.

""I was very touched by the story,"" he said. ""I knew instantly that the stage play had to be a movie.

""Every gay man in Sydney can probably identify with parts of that story.""

Ready to move out of property development, Huang wanted the story about love enduring, despite the devastation of AIDS, to reach a wider audience.

""Had I been five years older, I would have been caught in the whole AIDS crisis and I'd be dead by now,"" he said. ""I'm very fortunate. That's why I think it's so important that this story be told.""

Huang formed a partnership with Murphy then set about learning filmmaking, finding many similarities to his former career.

""With property development, you have to start with a good piece of land in a good location,"" he said. ""In filmmaking, you start with a good story.

""Then you hire an architect to draw a beautiful building. In filmmaking, you hire a writer to write a script.

""Once you have the architectural drawings, you hire a builder to translate the drawings into a physical building. In film, you hire a producer and director to translate the words into pictures.

""At the end, you hire an agent to sell your property and you hire a distributor to distribute your movie. The process is similar; the product is different.""

As a rare ""angel"" investor in an Australian film, Huang is executive producer of Holding the Man.

Producer Kylie Du Fresne, best known for The Sapphires, said financing what she describes as a medium-budget Australian film was surprisingly smooth because of Huang's contribution.

""Cameron was putting up almost the same amount of money that Screen Australia was,"" she said. ""It wasn't because he saw himself making a career as a film investor. It was because he believed in the material.""

While he wanted creative input on the script, casting and editing, Du Fresne said Huang was highly respectful of the filmmakers' expertise.

""He spent a lot of time on set just quietly watching from the back.""

While Huang concedes there is a chance he could lose all his investment, he believes the quality of the filmmaking team has minimised the risk. And the positive early response to the film has eased his nerves.

""You could play this story with a different disease – it could be cancer – and it's still a beautiful love story,"" he said. ""It just happens that instead of Romeo and Juliet, it's Romeo and Romeo."" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.",5f9e221c-6391-46ac-a329-05d026555ce2,News,2015-09-04T08:48:05Z,Oberon Review,Cameron Huang punts $1 million riding on Neil Armfield's Holding the Man,0.0,News

5499,"ISLAMABAD: The new judicial year 2015-16 commenced on Monday with the newly elevated Chief Justice Anwar Zaheer Jamali expressing a resolve to dedicate the period to self-accountability by reactivating the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) – a constitutional body that holds the superior court judges accountable. 

“The SJC is being activated in view of the pending complaints before it under Article 209 of the Constitution against different judges,” the chief justice said. 

Right activists Asma Jehangir had on a number of occasions drawn the apex court’s attention to the complaints pending before the SJC against different judges. 

Also read: Justice Anwar Zaheer Jamali sworn in as country's top judge  

Speaking at the opening ceremony of the new judicial year at the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Jamali, in his speech in Urdu, expressed the hope that the process of self-accountability would not be a one-sided affair and that bar councils would also revive their disciplinary committees for accountability of delinquent lawyers in accordance with the law. 
Announces reactivation of Supreme Judicial Council  
Referring to a heavy backlog of 26,000 cases in the Supreme Court despite the fact that the judges had been continuously trying to clear the pendency of 15,000 cases, the chief justice blamed a number of factors, including last year’s sit-ins by the PTI and PAT on the Constitution Avenue blocking the easy access of litigants as well as counsel to the courts and resulting in unnecessary delay in hearings of different cases for several months. 

The other factors include lengthy proceedings on important petitions against the 18th and 21st amendments by a full court as well as preoccupation by a bench of the Supreme Court which investigated allegations of rigging in the 2013 general elections. 

These factors, the CJ said, had resulted in accumulation of a large number of cases in the apex court. 

Referring to the court’s Human Rights Cell (HRC), he said the cell had disposed of 28,034 complaints generally against police excesses, insensitivity and lack of governance by the administration, trampling the rights of women and minorities and delay in issuance of pension to retired employees. 

At present, he added, the HRC was seized with 11,002 complaints and the cell set up to also look into the complaints of overseas Pakistanis had cleared 1,394 of the 2,055 cases. 

The chief justice said the offices falling vacant because of recent retirement of two judges would be filled soon. 

The Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan (LJPC) has formed committees under two retired judges of the Supreme Court – Justices Mian Shakirullh Jan and Khilji Arif Hussain – to prepare recommendations for improving and simplifying the existing laws for the benefit of common citizens. “Being chairman of the LJCP, it will be my endeavour to bring reforms by ending malpractices and corruption in the judiciary for better results,” the CJ said. 

He expressed the hope that the recent judgments by the Supreme Court, especially on the poll rigging case, would help bring reforms and eliminate social evils from society. 

Earlier, Attorney General Salman Aslam Butt drew the attention of the Supreme Court to a recent tendency of suspending laws made by parliament, especially on imposition of taxes, by courts at an interim stage and sometimes without even issuing a notice to the government side. 

“Taxation is a sovereign function of the state and the constitution guarantees that no tax will be levied except under a law,” he said. He stressed the need for following the mandate of the constitution in letter and spirit as laid down by the apex court to overcome this problem. 

The attorney general said the government had submitted a bill to parliament for reforming the civil justice system which also aimed at discouraging frivolous litigations. He regretted that despite stressing the importance of fundamental rights of access to justice, “we are still struggling to enforce it for the benefit of the common man”. 

Pakistan Bar Council’s Vice Chairman Azam Nazeer Tarar said the Supreme Court was a seat of justice, but not a seat of power. The resolution of delicate political issues is not the domain of the apex court even if a constitutional garb allows it. 

The judgments by the court, he said, must be based on strong legal foundations and address grievances or violations of rights, adding that a number of sound judgments might be unpopular but they were judged as upright, while others were sadly perceived to be populist and pandering to personal desires of judges. 

Ethnic and linguistic rights are among the most delicate political issues in the country and cannot be resolved with the stroke of a pen but through a political consensus. 

Referring to the upholding of military courts set up under the 21st Amendment, Mr Tarar expressed scepticism over the logic that there were basic features of the constitution, including the fundamental rights, but at the same time these fundamental rights were not offended by the trials of civilians in the military courts. 

He said the holding of courts till late evening would not end the backlog of cases and denying lawyers their legitimate need to take off during vacations would not add to efficiency. 

The Supreme Court Bar Association president urged the chief justice to consider and rectify what he called horrible effects of the July 31, 2009, judgment whereby more than 100 judges had been removed against the norms of the constitution.

There's a lot of exposition going on in this conversation between Artanis and He Whose Name Will Not Be Spelled, on the eve of the Protoss assault on Aiur.

Another tourney title for Trojans: Class 6A No. 2 Jenks extended its winning streak to 16 matches with a 3-1 (22-25, 25-10, 25-20, 25-22) victory over third-ranked Edmond Santa Fe in the finals of the Jenks Invitational on Saturday. 

The Trojans (22-2) beat Norman North, Chisholm and NOAH in pool play before advancing and beating Cascia Hall in the semifinals. 

It’s Jenks’ second straight tournament title, after claiming the Bishop Kelley tournament crown on Sept. 12. 

“Having two tournament wins feels great, not because of the wins so much as the girls reaching two of their four goals they set early on in the season when we were at team camp,” Jenks coach Tanna Smith said. “I know my girls are excited as they hit milestone after milestone down their road to the state tournament.” 
 
Jenks’ win over Edmond Santa Fe atoned for the Trojans’ 3-0 loss to the Wolves on Aug. 21. The two 6A powers will meet again Thursday at Frank Herald Fieldhouse. 

The Trojans’ Anabella Pope was named the tournament’s most valuable player, and Jenks’ Maggie Hembree and Ally Stoner joined her on the all-tournament team. Cascia Hall’s Amanda Outlaw, Broken Arrow’s Makina Wratten, NOAH’s Malia Leatherland and Claremore Sequoyah’s Karlye Wagner also picked up all-tournament accolades. 

Silver for Lincoln Christian: Mount Saint Mary, ranked third in Class 4A, knocked off 4A’s top team, Lincoln Christian, 3-1 (25-21, 23-25, 25-19, 25-18) in the finals of the LCS Invitational on Saturday. The Bulldogs had gone 4-0 in tournament play before settling for second place. 

“We really played well this weekend, I thought,” said Lincoln Christian coach Zac Briscoe, whose team had beaten Mount Saint Mary 3-1 on Aug. 31. “We just didn’t play our best in the final, and Mount Saint Mary probably had a lot to do with that.” 

Lincoln Christian is now 19-3 and will find out its regional tournament assignment Thursday. 

“We’ve played great all season, and we are off to our best start in school history,” Briscoe said. “But we need to retool some things and get better in the next few weeks to be ready for state.” 

Mustangs charging hard: Okay missed out on last year’s Class 3A state tournament, and that didn’t sit well with the Mustangs, coach Belinda Clark said. 

“Losing at regionals last year by just three points served as a motivator for these girls,” she said. 

The 3A No. 2 Mustangs have turned that inspiration into a 21-6 record with the playoffs fast approaching. Clark also alluded to another reason for success. 

“Having a court full of good hitters has also helped us,” she said. “We are not dependent on one or two. We can hit from anywhere.” 

Asked to point to a couple of key contributors, Clark couldn’t help but name nearly everyone on her team — hitters/blockers Karleigh McMahan, Kirstyn Anderson, Summer Milligan and Blake Judkins, setter Jade Hopkins, libero Macy Haley and junior varsity call-up, Emily Taylor. 

“To ask who is leading the way, I would have to say they all are,” Clark said. 

We wouldn’t be where we are today without all of them together. They are all key players in our game.”

Book Review: Rating: 3.5/5 I have read Simi's books in the past and enjoyed them. Like her previous books, this one also has Indian arranged marriage in the mix but unlike the previous books, this is a Wedding Story!  The cover is beautiful and reminded me of the fun and happiness that comes when I attend a wedding in India. The blurb is interesting and instantly peaks our interest.  The plot is interesting and had great potential. The execution is entertaining but the story left so many questions behind in my mind. So many story lines were hinted at and then never developed which left questions in my mind like it is told that Mili's father is struggling to keep his business and Mili is determined to help her father but nothing is later elaborated on it neither is it mentioned in the story again. Then Mili's friends' angle is also hinted at but then left hanging and so on.

A24 has acquired U.S. rights to John Cameron Mitchell’s drama “How To Talk To Girls At Parties,” starring Elle Fanning, Nicole Kidman and Alex Sharp.

The film, set to start production in November, is based on a short story by Neil Gaiman. Producers are Howard Gertler (Mitchell’s “Shortbus”), Iain Canning and Emile Sherman. Mitchell is exec producing.

“How to Talk to Girls at Parties” focuses on a shy teenage punk rocker in 1970s suburban London and his two closest friends who sneak into a party where they meet a group of otherworldly girls — and realize the girls are literally from outer space. The lead character falls in love with one of the girls, despite the nefarious plans of the aliens.

The project reteams Mitchell with Kidman, who collaborated on the 2010 drama “Rabbit Hole.” Kidman received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress.

“A24 is the best U.S. indie film distributor for a film like ours,” said Mitchell. “They combine today’s market strategies with the daring taste that flourished in the 90’s and 00’s.”

Mitchell co-wrote the screenplay with Philippa Goslett. Nico Muhly, Jamie Stewart of Xiu Xiu and Matmos are on board to compose original music and songs for the project.

Sharp won a Tony for “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.” Fanning was most recently seen in “Maleficent” and stars opposite Bryan Cranston in “Trumbo.”

Mitchell’s credits include “Hedwig and the Angry Inch” and “Shortbus.”

CAA negotiated the deal on behalf of the filmmakers.

1635,"Looking high in the northeast after darkness falls, the glittering stars of the “BIG W” shine forth. No, not a neon sign for a chain department store. This is the constellation Cassiopeia, whose five principal stars wonderfully form the letter “W.” Of course it depends on orientation. Sometimes it appears like an “M.” While the constellation is rising in the northeast, the “W” is more on its side. In early September around 1 a.m., it is high up in the north, perhaps straight overhead where you live. It is then shaped like an “M.” Twelve hours later, the constellation is at its low point, and appears as a true “W.” At this time of year, that is close to 1 in the afternoon. The “W” is there, just like all the rest of the stars, but you won’t see it in broad daylight. The only star you can see by day is the Sun! Like all constellations, Cassiopeia seems to circle around an imaginary point on the sky next to the North Star. Directly opposite from Cassiopeia on the other side of the North Star is the famed seven stars of the Big Dipper. The Earth’s rotation, of course, makes the sky seems to spin around. As we advance towards new moon on Sept. 13, we can enjoy moonless nights, and the maaximum amount of stars you can see. Cassiopeia is amidst the hazy glow of the Milky Way Band which at this time of year in the evening extends across the sky and down in the south. The view with eyes alone is spectacular enough, but just try it with binoculars! With binoculars, scan the stars the next September evening just below the “W” on its side. Look below the “W”’s bottom segment, by a little more than the length of that segment. You should quickly be able to spot the “Double Cluster,” a pair of open star clusters of similar brightness and size. With unaided eyes under a dark sky you can see the Double Cluster as a small pair of fuzzy patches. Binoculars will begin to reveal the myriad stars in each cluster. The view in a small telescope at low power is stunning. The planet Saturn may be currently seen low in the southwest once darkness falls, appearing like a bright star. If you arise early (or stay up very late), look low in the eastern sky about an hour before sunrise. Venus is very bright. To the upper left is the planet Mars, much dimmer and reddish. Be sure to look on the mornings of Sept. 9, 10 and 11, should skies be clear. The crescent moon will be gliding between Venus and Mars. Mark your calendar: North America is favored by a total lunar eclipse on Sunday evening Sept. 27! An upcoming column will discuss this further. Keep looking up! Peter W.

2986,"Reuters  –  
LONDON (Reuters) - Manchester United will bank on the dazzling form of Anthony Martial in Wednesday's Champions League game against VfL Wolfsburg as Louis van Gaal's men look to bounce back from their opening defeat in Group B. 
 
The 19-year-old Frenchman, initially seen as a panic buy on the last day of the transfer window this month, has been a revelation, netting four times since leaving Monaco to help United top the Premier League for the first time in two years. 
 
The Old Trafford club lost their first Champions League match 2-1 to PSV Eindhoven in a game overshadowed by the broken leg suffered by Luke Shaw but have since won 3-2 at Southampton and beaten Sunderland 3-0. 
 
Wayne Rooney scored his first league goal of the campaign against Sunderland and with Martial providing pace and composure up front, Van Gaal’s attacking worries are receding. 
 
""He (Martial) is very direct, he is willing to take on players and he is willing to take on that risk,"" said United defender Chris Smalling. 
 
""I think, in the final third, it is an area where you can take that risk because you can't take it at the back. He looks a very sharp player."" 
 
Goalkeeper David de Gea has also been in fine form after signing a new contract while Smalling and Daley Blind have formed a solid central defensive pairing and Morgan Schneiderlin and Bastian Schweinsteiger have added experience and craft to the midfield. 
 
AIM HIGHER 
 
""We have improved,"" Smalling said. ""Last season’s start was disastrous and it didn't give us a foothold to be able to challenge for anything. 
 
""We know we have improved in this section of the season and we now have to improve in each other section compared to last season and aim a lot higher."" 
 
Wounded Wolfsburg, who drew 1-1 with Hanover 96 on Saturday after being crushed 5-1 by Bayern Munich last week, are likely to be without midfielders Luiz Gustavo and Vieirinha. 
 
Brazil international Luiz Gustavo was taken off midway through their demolition at Bayern with a knee injury and coach Dieter Hecking says his chances of playing in Manchester ""don't look good"". 
 
Portuguese Vieirinha has returned to training after a three-week break caused by a thigh injury but the game at Old Trafford could come too soon for him. 
 
The Wolves, who won their opener against CSKA Moscow, are looking to take control of the group. 
 
""We have worked very hard to get here and experience games like the one at Manchester United,"" said captain Diego Benaglio. ""So we want to look really good there and we are certainly not going to England just to look at the stadium.""

6786,"Fans have been waiting for a Deadpool movie for over a decade. Ryan Reynolds became attached to play the Merc with a Mouth as far back as 2004 when a solo film about the meta mercenary was in the works at New Line Cinema, but he didn’t end up playing the character until a bastardized version of him arrived in X-Men Origins: Wolverine . 
 
After the disappointing spin-off mistreated the character on the big screen, rumors of a solo film persisted and finally came closer to reality after a pitch reel was made by visual effects wizard Tim Miller . Thankfully the pitch reel was leaked and fan reaction was finally enough to convince 20th Century Fox to make the movie. 
 
Now that the film is in post-production, Ryan Reynolds talks Deadpool , opening up a bit about the thrill of finally getting to make this movie after 10 years and why now is the perfect time to make it happen. 
 
A new interview with GQ has Reynolds talking about savoring the moment that they began shooting Deadpool , realizing how long it had taken to reach this point: 
 
“Yeah! Oh, I made sure we marked it, too. Like, we just started rolling, and I was like, ‘No, no, hold on.’ We went in the other room and we huddled up: ‘We’re making this movie! We’ve been trying to get this movie made for six fucking years, and here we are. We’re doing it right now. Just remember this second. Just take a moment to be thankful for that.’ And then we all went out and just started shooting and dicking around and had some fun.” 
 
But we’re living in a market that some would say is over-saturated by comic book movies. So how is Deadpool going to stand out? And what does Reynolds think when someone like Steven Spielberg ( echoed by Zack Snyder ) says that superhero movies are just a phase and will end up going the way of westerns, fading out of popularity and mostly into obscurity? Reynolds says: 
 
“It’s a genre. There are good horror movies and bad horror movies. There are good comedies and bad comedies. Think of it like that. Think of it less about just superheroes. I do believe that they explore similar archetypes a lot, so I think that notion can be somewhat fatiguing, maybe. I think one of the reasons that Deadpool has gained a lot of momentum isn’t just that it’s funny or isn’t just that it’s rated R. The meta aspect is very important. So I think Deadpool’s coming along at the right time, because it’s also speaking to that generation and that group of people that have seen them all, seen all these comic-book films and enjoyed them all to varying degrees of success. But I think it’s speaking to them as though the guy in that red suit is one of them, to some degree.” 
 
The idea of Deadpool being able to make fun of the tropes that have become part of superhero movies for the past 15 years is definitely something that wouldn’t have been as easy if the movie was made back when it first went into development. With dozens of movies to mock and reference, Deadpool should have plenty of fuel for the fire. And as evidenced in the red band trailer , the meta nature will definitely be a big part of what sets it apart from the rest. 
 
Deadpool is directed by Tim Miller and written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick ( Zombieland ). The rest of the cast includes T.J. Miller as Weasel, Gina Carano as Angel Dust, Brianna Hildebrand as Negasonic Teenage Warhead, Morena Baccarin as Copycat and Ed Skrein as Ajax, not to mention a prominent role for Andre Tricoteux as the metal mutant Colossus. 
 
Based upon Marvel Comics’ most unconventional anti-hero, DEADPOOL tells the origin story of former Special Forces operative turned mercenary Wade Wilson, who after being subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers, adopts the alter ego Deadpool. Armed with his new abilities and a dark, twisted sense of humor, Deadpool hunts down the man who nearly destroyed his life. 
 
Deadpool arrives on February 12th, 2016 .

6028,"Sydney waterfront employees have been accused of accepting lucrative kickbacks in return for allowing the passage of illegal tobacco in Australia. Sydney waterfront employees have been accused of accepting lucrative kickbacks in return for allowing the passage of illegal tobacco into Australia.

A multi-agency operation has thwarted the alleged cigarette and tobacco racket, with police charging 13 people, including businessmen and a Lone Wolf bikie gang member.

Seventeens raids were rolled out in Sydney's south and south-west on Tuesday with more than $400,000 in cash, cigarettes and documents seized.

Police will allege in court employees attached to customs brokerage companies and freight forwarding firms received payments to create false declarations and shipping documents.

These actions allegedly enabled more than 10 million cigarettes and 5.6 tonnes of tobacco to be illegally imported.

That included, police will allege, the passage of nine million cigarettes from the United Arab Emirates, which arrived at Port Botany this month.

Police said they worked closely with Dubai customs officials from the UAE as part of this investigation phase.

A local syndicate then collected the shipments for distribution around Sydney.

As a result of the racket, the group allegedly avoided paying more than $9.1 million in customs duties on 10 million cigarettes and 5.6 tonnes of tobacco.

Police allege some syndicate members were also dabbling in cocaine supply.

About 270 grams of cocaine worth $184,000 was seized during the joint Australian Federal Police, NSW Police and NSW Crime Commission investigation.

Assets, including houses, and bank accounts attached to some of those in the syndicate have been frozen or confiscated.

Detective Superintendent Nick Bingham said further arrests would take place in the future.

""This operation has shut down a significant syndicate allegedly involved in facilitating the importation of illicit goods into the country and distributing those goods into the community, as well as trafficking in commercial amounts of prohibited drugs,"" the Polaris Waterfront Task Force commander said.

""The importance of a multi-agency taskforce that has the capacity to work with authorities in the United Arab Emirates and the shipping industry cannot be understated.""

The array of charges laid against 12 men and one woman included smuggling tobacco products, fraud and dealing with proceeds of crime.

The 24-year-old Lone Wolf gang member was charged with cocaine supply and perjury.

A 37-year-old customs broker was charged with smuggling, forgery, fraud and drug supply offences.

A customs underbond warehouse manager is facing charges of forgery, conspiracy to fraud and dealing in proceeds of crime.

6539,"It was the Carly Fiorina show at the second GOP Debate of the 2016 presidential race, and in a debate where presidential hopes and gains were on the line, Fiorina basically stole the night. Here are the winners and losers of what was an interesting night in Simi Valley. 

Winners 
 
Carly Fiorina  
 
Fiorina had been on a slow path upward in the polls following her strong debate in Cleveland, and this earned her a spot at the adult’s debate in Simi Valley, and she proved that she belonged on the big stage and then some. Out of the three “outside” candidates, Fiorina was the only one to have a firm grip on the issues, and her link of Iran and Planned Parenthood was simply masterful. In addition, she may be seen as a savior to the GOP’s women problem, and if anyone didn’t know Fiorina before Simi Valley, they do now, and she should see a major jump in her poll numbers. 
 
Marco Rubio  
 
Rubio had a good debate in Cleveland, but it didn’t really do anything for his sliding poll numbers. But he had a strong debate in Simi Valley, and his shining moment was when he batted back the rhetoric that English is needed to achieve the American dream. It is still up in the air as whether or not this will have an effect on his poll numbers, but it should put him in good shape heading into Boulder. 
 
Chris Christie  
 
Christie’s performance in Simi Valley was magnificent, and it was desperately needed because his campaign is in the life of death mode. In a night where it was “all about me,” Christie made the most of his time to make it about the voters, and it was a refreshing tone indeed. He did enough to at least secure his spot at the adult’s table in Boulder on Oct. 28. 
 
Losers 
 
Donald Trump  
 
Trump dominated the first debate in Cleveland, but it seemed that the barrage of attacks weakened him in Simi Valley, and he was basically a non-factor on most of the main issues of the night. He did make things entertaining by launching an attack on Rand Paul and his constant “emoji-like” facial expressions, but that was all he did. He gave little substance, and although this will not have an effect on his front-runner status (for now), he can ill afford to have another bad debate in Boulder, especially if Fiorina continues to shine and climb the polls. 
 
Ben Carson 
 
Carson was on the rise after Cleveland, even climbing even with Trump in one poll in Iowa. But he set himself back in a major way in Simi Valley. He seemed not ready for prime time on a lot of the key issues, even demeaning Latinos in the process with his explanation of his ""farmer's visa"", and his message of unity was lost. Expect Carson to lose his second-place status when the new polls roll out. 
 
Mike Huckabee and Ted Cruz  
 
Once again, the two Tea Party candidates gave spirited debates on the time they were given, but the problem with these two is that Trump has a deep grip on the voter base that would typically gravitate to candidates like Huckabee and Cruz, and they have nowhere to go to pick up the votes that are being lost to Trump. They may make it to Iowa, but that will be all she wrote for these two.",dbe74456-d67e-4ac0-ae9c-6e1c2a1213c2,News,2015-09-17T22:57:45Z,Examiner.com,Debate breakdown: The Carly Fiorina show,0.0,Blog

4412,"GOLD has retreated from the previous session's near three-week high as strength in stocks and the US dollar dampen a rally fuelled by the Federal Reserve's decision last week to keep US interest rates on hold.  
   
WALL Street and European stocks rebounded more than one per cent in rallies that, along with gains in the US dollar and global oil markets, pointed to a tentative recovery in investor confidence after the Federal Reserve delayed an interest rate rise. 
Spot gold was down 0.5 per cent at $US1,132.80 an ounce at 3:06 pm EDT (0506 Tuesday AEST), while US gold futures for December delivery settled down 0.4 per cent at $US1,132.80 per ounce. ""The weaker euro and a little recovery in the equity markets has robbed it (gold) of a bit of its steam,"" said James Steel, chief metals analyst for HSBC Securities in New York. ""The fact that the Fed didn't raise rates last week is going to lend some sort of long-term support to the market."" Gold held in a narrow range earlier this month on uncertainty over whether the Fed would hike rates for the first time in nearly a decade, lifting the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion while potentially boosting the US dollar. It rose sharply after the Fed shied away from a hike on Thursday, peaking at $US1,141.50 the following day, but has now retreated below that level. With the Fed still expected to hike rates before the end of the year, gold could come under pressure again. ""My personal feeling is that the Fed still wants to raise rates and still expects to, but that there is still considerable uncertainty over the timing,"" Mitsui Precious Metals analyst David Jollie said. ""While the market expects rates to rise, any upside for gold should be somewhat limited."" Later in the session, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said that the six weeks until the Fed's next meeting in October may not be enough time to quell concerns about the global economy and possible risks to the US recovery. Silver rose 0.1 per cent at $US15.17 an ounce, while platinum was down 1.3 per cent at $US966.25 an ounce and palladium was up 1.3 per cent at $US610.75 an ounce. China's platinum imports rose 16 per cent in August, while palladium imports fell nearly 37 per cent and silver imports more than doubled. ""The silver price is clearly finding support from China again,"" Commerzbank said in a note.",30293274-6fa9-4030-ad24-8be84fe976b9,News,2015-09-21T21:46:03Z,Tasmania Mercury,Gold falls from near three-week high,0.0,News

4516,"Three Silicon Valley jail guards were arrested Thursday and accused of killing a homeless, mentally ill inmate last week.

The Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office has recommended that the district attorney file murder charges against correctional officers Rafael Rodriguez, 37, Jereh Lubrin, 28, and Matthew Farris, 27, who are being held without bail in another county, the San Jose Mercury News reported. The three, who are not sworn deputies and had worked at the jail for less than three years, are due in court Tuesday.​

They are accused of fatally beating 31-year-old Michael James Pipkin Tyree, who died Aug. 26 and was found the next morning while in protective custody at the main jail in San Jose. Having pleaded no contest to petty theft in a special mental-health court Aug. 23, he was waiting to be sent to a mental-health facility, the Mercury News wrote.

The medical examiner determined Tyree died of multiple blunt-force injuries, ""visceral lacerations"" and internal bleeding.

The decision to recommend murder charges has ""no known precedent"" in the 165-year history of the sheriff's office, the paper stated.

""Our client was slated to be released to a mental health bed but no bed was available, thus the reason he was still in jail,'' Santa Clara County Public Defender Molly O'Neal said Thursday. ""This tragedy underscores the need for a greater number of mental health beds so that clients with acute mental health needs do not sit in custodial facilities which are not therapeutic when they have been ordered released.""

Sheriff Laurie Smith addressed the case at an afternoon news conference.",5c766e94-c345-46cb-aacf-4bb37b34586f,News,2015-09-03T21:29:22Z,USA Today,3 Calif. jail guards accused of killing inmate,0.0,News

4434,"SHIPROCK, N.M. — Environmental activist Erin Brockovich, made famous from the Oscar-winning movie bearing her name, on Tuesday accused the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency of lying about how much toxic wastewater spilled from a Colorado mine and fouled rivers in three Western states. 
 
Her allegation came during a visit to the nation's largest American Indian reservation, where she saw the damage and met with Navajo Nation leaders and farmers affected by last month's spill, which was triggered by an EPA crew during excavation work. 
 
Brockovich said she was shocked by the agency's actions leading up to the release of waste tainted with heavy metals and its response afterward. 
 
""They did not tell the truth about the amount. There were millions and millions of gallons,"" she said while speaking to a crowd of high school students in Shiprock, New Mexico. 
 
The EPA did not immediately respond to email and telephone requests for comment Tuesday. The agency initially pegged the spill at 1 million gallons but later said it was likely three times that amount given the readings of stream gauges that recorded a spike in river flows. 
 
The revision only added to the suspicion of local officials that were criticizing the agency for failing to notify them sooner that the contaminated plume was headed downstream. 
 
Uncertainty lingers over the long-term dangers to public health and the environment from the spill, which contaminated rivers in Colorado, New Mexico and Utah. EPA says the threat has eased, allowing treatment plants to start drawing water from the rivers again and ending warnings against recreational activities. But Navajo leadership is skeptical. 
 
A series of congressional hearings investigating the spill will begin Wednesday. Republican committee leaders in the House and Senate say that EPA officials have withheld documents that could explain what went wrong. 
 
Navajo President Russell Begaye also questions the number of gallons released. He recounted for Brockovich what he saw during an unannounced visit to the Gold King Mine near Silverton, Colorado, days after the spill. He said he saw a wide gully that was several feet deep and water continuing to pour out of the mine. 
 
Some Navajo irrigation systems remain shuttered until the tribe receives results from its own water and sediment testing. As a result, Begaye has said thousands of acres of crops have gone dry. 
 
Begaye and Brockovich met with farmers to discuss the effects of the spill on irrigation as well as the legacy of contamination left behind by decades of uranium mining. 
 
During the stop in Shiprock, they told the students that it will be up to the next generation to hold government and private industry accountable. 
 
""It's a terrible disaster, and unfortunately it's a situation we see playing itself out not only on the Navajo Nation, but across the United States of America,"" Brockovich said, referring to pollution and lax enforcement. 
 
""You are the future and you will be the answers,"" she told the students. 
 
Brockovich was portrayed in the 2000 movie, ""Erin Brockovich,"" which earned actress Julia Roberts an acting Oscar. The environmental advocate helped investigate a major case of groundwater contamination in California in the early 1990s that inspired the film. 
 
As for the Gold King spill, Brockovich said the federal government needs to clean up the mess. 
 
Navajo officials say the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the EPA have declined the tribe's requests for continued help, including the appointment of a federal recovery coordinator. 
 
A FEMA spokeswoman said the EPA was the lead agency and would be responsible for coordinating with the tribe and other local governments.",22f1dc3d-d57e-4806-a01d-00015a3dbe05,News,2015-09-08T22:34:05Z,Minneapolis Star Tribune,Erin Brockovich accuses feds of lying about mine waste spill,0.0,News

1264,"Has your young genius been lost somewhere along the way? 
 
As this Equinox season unfolds, I invite you to inquire into your own young inner genius, her health, her presence in your life, how she showed up then , and how to invite her back to play, and in particular to enrich the entire fabric of your Great Work that is emerging, that is being called forth from within you. 
 
Circle/Reflections 
 
The following challenge, started earlier in the summer, has continued to tickle my fancy behind the scenes as multiple dimensions and deep levels of change are currently playing out for me. 
 
With acknowledgements to Jeffrey Davis of Tracking Wonder for this summertime # DareToExcel Challenge . This is #3 for #Daredevils and other conscious co-creators. 
 
Take a few minutes to remember a time when you were nine – or around that age – when you felt free to be your best. 
 
Feel an exact moment in time and place. Are you outdoors or indoors? How does the air feel? How do you feel in your body? What are you uniquely doing or making? Who are you with and how are you uniquely relating to others? 
 
Looking back with full compassion toward yourself, what 1-3 adjectives would you use to describe your younger self at her or his best? 
 
These are your 3 Young Genius Qualities. 
 
How can you bring some of those young genius qualities forward to this project? 
 
Share: Post written reflections or the three young genius qualities you commit to bring forward. 
 
  
 So what are my three young genius qualities?  
Curiosity. Observing/Listening. Dreaming. 
 
An only child, often left to my own devices, summer was for dreaming and reading, drawing, listening into the stream of imaginary friends who stepped out of the pages of books, magic, daring. Imagining myself as Nancy Drew during languid summers, reading, imagining, dreaming, reading some more. Observing the fireflies and butterflies. Tasting sweet concord grapes, stretched out in the grass made crisp by the summer sunshine. Listening to the crickets and then crackling campfires. Walking in the dark under the stars, hours with markers, and once at a dude ranch — Horses! (That one ultimately didn’t go as I dreamed…but I did learn about cleaning a cast iron skillet with sand on our breakfast trail ride.) 
 
And in partnership with that magical genius child, her shadowy wounded child plays around the edges. Still. She holds loss and grief that was too much to bear then, and now, in a powerful time of change, it’s all being offered up for clearing. Love and loss and grief — all reminders of how it once was and how it all changed so suddenly. 
 
What are your young genius qualities? 
 
If you’re someone with curiosity rarely sated, who deeply appreciates the gifts of listening/observing, who still has a dream percolating inside, let’s see if we are growing in a garden together. (You probably also have a passion for words, images, healing/wholeness, following a spiritual path, and are deeply engaged with purpose.) 
 
I am called to focus on the wise women, women who ardently yearn for a secret weapon to see them through Kali’s fire, the chaos of their reinvention, and onto the other side. 
 
Especially if you are a woman in the third act, you find dreams now impossible to ignore. You need your inner partners, the inner genius child and the wounded one, as well as your connection to a source (or sources) of guidance.  And outer collaborators are helpful, if you are ready to take a stand for your new and evolving, highly purposeful, change-the-world body of work (even and especially if it’s not yet fully formed). 
 
As thought partner and sounding board for women in the third act, like you, I hold the space and help you recognize yourself as purposeful change agent, sage-hearted messenger, co-creator of a new paradigm world, and conscious collaborator with the emerging future. You’re ready for connecting in with guidance in real-time and within collaborative co-creative new paradigm spaces. 
 Harvest Season  
At the Equinox, and with the upcoming Harvest Full Moon, (and a lunar eclipse!) big things are shaking loose on so many levels. Have you been feeling these shifts? 
 
You know now is the time to harvest your wisdom. It’s the season for the blueprint of your Great Work to emerge. You are in a place of creative ferment, and clarity seems just out of reach. Articulating the pre-verbal birthing of your new program or book or body of work, you seek the sacred emergent words — words you didn’t even know you knew — and a way to organize and package those gifts and brilliance. 
 
From there, what if you could discover a sacred space, listening for the whispers of your Divine Audience just waiting to be called forth into YOUR circle? Your soul tribe is ready to connect and celebrate the birth of your revelatory manifestation and body of work. 
 
Your young inner genius has much to contribute to your body of work. When you consciously partner with your young genius, listen to the wisdom from your wounded one, and tap into real-time, practical source(s) of guidance, you are poised for making the biggest difference. YOU matter. Your divine audience is waiting for you! Your Emerging Future beckons! 
 
Welcome, young genius! Welcome, wise woman! Remember that all parts serve, so let’s have a co-creation party!

9299,"[A new transit-oriented development being built next to the Paulina Brown Line station. Photo: Curbed Chicago] Virtually the entire North Side is now on-limits for developers who are looking to build new residential developments with reduced parking requirements. Yesterday, the city's zoning committee approved a new measure to expand the radius where transit-oriented developments (TODs) can be built. The ordinance heads on to the City Council, where it is likely to receive final approval. Previous rules allowed developers to build new transit-oriented residential projects that were located in a 600 foot radius of a transit station or within 1,200 feet from a city-designated pedestrian street, but the new changes will allow developers to build within a 1,320 foot radius of a transit station or 2,640 feet from a designated pedestrian street. The new ordinance more than doubles the available space where developers can build projects with reduced parking. There will be many more TOD proposals  [Just a handful of the new TODs on their way to the North Side.] The idea is to put as many residences near transit hubs and busy commercial corridors as possible, but some neighborhood groups are concerned about developers building dense projects on residential side streets. The passage of the new ordinance opens the door for developers to propose new transit-oriented projects throughout much of the city, and there's certainly no doubt that popular neighborhoods that have been the focus of transit-oriented development will continue to see more of these projects. ·Aldermen back allowing developers to build with fewer parking spaces [Tribune]

926,"NEWARK –  The city's downtown may soon be home to another new hotel. 
 
Hari Newark Urban Renewal LLC has filed plans with the city to convert the former Catholic Charities building at 1136-1166 Raymond Boulevard into a Homewood Suites Hotel by Hilton extended-stay hotel. 
 
The Edison-based developer is also seeking a 20-year tax abatement from the city, which the Municipal Council could approve at its regular meeting Wednesday night. 
 
The 12-story building across from Military Park is currently vacant. It is bordered by a parking garage to the east, and Commerce Court to the west. 
 PLUS:  Newark alters regulations to pave way for potential downtown casino 

Hilton spokeswoman Tiffany Wilson said she had no information on when the hotel might open or any agreement with Hari Newark Urban Renewal. 
 
Public records indicate that the Edison-based development company is owned by Mehendra Patel, who could not be reached for comment. 
 
The new hotel would be one of several planned to open around Newark in the coming years, after the city went nearly four decades without a single new one. 
 
That streak ended in 2012, when the Courtyard Marriott opened near the Prudential Center arena downtown , and others have followed, including the boutique Hotel Indigo on Broad Street. 
 
Last year, officials approved plans for a Carvi Hotel at the intersection of Lafayette and Monroe streets – the first to be built in the city's Ironbound section . 
 
Hilton also has plans for a 108-room Home2 Suites hotel on Haynes Avenue in the South Ward, close to the site of a proposed new train station along a new leg of the PATH rail line to Newark Liberty International Airport. 
 
Wilson said that hotel is projected to open in December 2017.

1373,"Dear Dr. Carson,
 
 I write to express my disappointment at best for your statements on the NBC Sunday broadcast of ""Meet the Press"" on September 20, 2015. Host Chuck Todd raised the controversy surrounding Donald Trump's failure to correct an audience member in a town hall meeting in New Hampshire last week who asserted that President Obama is a Muslim, and then he advocated for the forceful deportation of Muslims from the U.S. Todd then asked you about your take on the controversy, to which you replied that a Muslim should not become president of our country: ""I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation. I absolutely would not agree with that.""
 
 As a highly educated person, as a candidate for the presidency, and as someone who has co-authored, along with your wife Candy, a book titled A More Perfect Union: What We the People Can Do to Reclaim Our Constitutional Liberties, you should have a more enlightened understanding of our nation's foundational document. 
 
 In the book you write generally about the ""basic principles"" of the Constitution and how ""they relate to our everyday lives."" You go on to state: ""I believe that making a difference starts with understanding our amazing founding document, the U.S. Constitution."" You assert that both you and Candy wrote the book to ""help defend"" the Constitution ""from those who misinterpret and undermine it."" 
 
 Well, now I'm really confused! How can you inform others and ""help defend"" the Constitution when you do not have even a basic understanding? Your recorded statements indicate that you have misinterpreted and undermined the document. If this were not the case, you would not have made your blatantly Islamophobic assertions on ""Meet the Press,"" especially when Todd asked you, ""So do you believe that Islam is consistent with the Constitution,"" and you replied, ""No, I don't. I do not."" 
 
 Your answer leads me to believe that you practice a version of ""cafeteria Constitutionalism"" picking and choosing which of the passages should refer to which groups of people. Since you are a Christian follower of the Seventh Day Adventist Church, I am assuming that you are not placing Article VI of the US Constitution on your cafeteria tray: ""No religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States."" In addition, you seem to want to delete the First Amendment from the menu and toss it down the garbage disposal: ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ...""
 
 When Donald Trump makes his racist and xenophobic statements about immigrants, and when he throws misogynistic tantrums about women, and when he does not correct questioners about President Obama's religion and birth status, I am not particularly surprised since Trump has centered his entire campaign on issues and discussions based on hate and fear that seem to have resonated with the base of the Republican Party. 
 
 You Dr. Carson, in fact, appear to practice the same sort of despicable tactics as Donald Trump (as well as many others with whom you share the debate stage and the clown car as you all drive down the path toward the presidential primaries). I see an underlying philosophical trend among many of you Republican candidates, whether on issues around immigration, issues of equity between genders and sexual identities, and issues of religion. 
 
 Once people like yourselves have entered the doorway of opportunity, you attempt to close the door in the face of others. All of the candidates are citizens of the United States, so now you want to close the door of citizenship to others. Since you all have quality healthcare, you want to take it away from the estimated 16 million people who now have health insurance for the first time under the Affordable Care Act. Though you may assume that all presidents since George Washington have followed Christian faiths -- though some have defined themselves instead as ""Deists"" -- you want to close the door of the office to anyone other than those of you with verified Christian credentials. 
 
 Dr. Carson, you are running for the presidency by standing on the shoulders of the brave and tireless pioneers who came before you who made it possible for you and for Mr. Obama. I still remember seeing on television the lunch counter sit-ins, the voting rights registration drives, the ""Freedom Schools,"" the marches, and the many other forms of civil disobedience aimed at abolishing discriminatory and abusive ""Jim Crow"" laws, which advanced and strengthened white supremacy by maintaining segregation and withholding the ballot from people of color. 
 
 Your statements and those of many of your challengers on the Republican side of the political spectrum are replicating discriminatory policies by advancing and strengthening Christian supremacy by maintaining segregation and withholding opportunities from non-Christians, in particular, Muslims. How ""Constitutional"" Dr. Carson are these actions? 
 
 In your book you write: ""And as someone who has performed brain surgery thousands of times, I can assure you that the Constitution isn't brain surgery.""

6032,"MOSCOW/ALMATY Police in Tajikistan said on Saturday they had closed in on a sacked deputy defence minister accused of leading gun attacks around the capital Dushanbe, amid rising tension between the pro-Moscow secular government and Islamist opposition. 

Nine police officers and 13 rebels were killed in Friday's clashes in Dushanbe and the nearby city of Vahdat, police said. 

Following the attacks, security forces in the Central Asian nation pursued the insurgents, led by renegade general Abdulkhalim Mirzo Nazarzod, to a gorge some 150 km (95 miles) from the city. Nazarzod was dismissed by President Imomali Rakhmon on Friday for ""committing a crime"". 

""The territory has been completely surrounded, the operation to apprehend and neutralise the criminals is under way,"" the Interior Ministry said in a statement. 

A Dushanbe journalist told Reuters by telephone the city was   quiet on Saturday, and shops and businesses were open as normal. 

But the outbreak of violence has raised fears of a return to unrest in Tajikistan, a hard-up Muslim nation of 8 million, still volatile after a 1992-97 civil war between the Moscow-backed government and Islamist opposition. 

Nazarzod is a member of the main opposition Islamic Revival Party of Tajikistan (IRPT), and a former opposition militiaman. He was brought into the Tajik armed forces under a 1997 peace deal to end the conflict which killed tens of thousands. 
 
Rakhmon, a former head of a Soviet state farm who has ruled since 1992 with little tolerance of dissent, has locked horns with the Islamist opposition in what his opponents say is an illegal crackdown. 

Russia supported Rakhmon during the civil war and still keeps a 6,000-strong military base in Tajikistan. 

Muhiddin Kabiri, the head of the IRPT, fled abroad in June to avoid what he called trumped up criminal charges which the authorities were planning to bring against him. 
 
""The pressure the ruling regime is exerting on my party is not good for stability, on the contrary, it is giving rise to radical ideas,"" he said at the time. 

IRPT leaders remaining in Tajikistan could not be reached for comment on Saturday. 

The latest bout of violence ""is beyond all doubt a reaction to Rakhmon's Islamophobia"", said Kazakhstan-based Central Asia political analyst Alexander Knyazev. 

""It looks like Rakhmon will now tighten the screws to totally suppress any sort of dissent,"" he told Reuters. 
 
Russia says it is worried by the security situation in Central Asia following the withdrawal of NATO troops from next-door Afghanistan. 

However critics say tough official measures to stamp out Islamist militancy risk provoking a backlash across Central Asia, including Tajikistan. Risks of a spillover from Islamic State in Syria and Iraq have added to fears of unrest. 

The Interior Ministry said the army and special forces were involved in the operation in Ramit Gorge, in which 32 insurgents were arrested. 

The violence prompted the U.S. embassy in Dushanbe to shut. A statement on its website said the incidents ""may be precursors to other acts of violence.""

12,"Official says 'small number' of Benghazi-related emails 

By 

Updated 09/25 2015 06:51PM

An email chain between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and then-commander of U.S. Central Command David Petraeus from January and February 2009 is raising questions about whether some of the emails on Clinton's private email server were mistakenly deemed personal and not included among the 55,000 pages of emails she turned over to the State Department. 

Separately on Friday, a State Department official said a ""small number"" of Benghazi-related emails that had not been disclosed to the House committee investigating the 2012 terror attack had been discovered. 

In the past few days, the State Department was contacted by the Department of Defense about the Clinton-Petraeus chain, two State Department officials said. The officials say the chain does not appear to include classified information, though an official determination has not been made. The chain included Clinton and Petraeus getting acquainted as well as some personnel matters, according to the officials. It was apparently considered personal by Clinton's team and therefore wasn't turned over to the State Department, the officials said. 

Most of the email chain was on an old email server Clinton says she no longer has access to, but the end of the email chain contained messages on the private server she used while in office, according to another official. The chain begins on January 10, 2009 and ends on Feb. 1, 2009 and contains less than 10 emails total between Clinton and Petraeus, the official said. 

State Department spokesman John Kirby said State received ""several copies of one email chain between former Secretary Clinton and then Commander of U.S. Central Command David Petraeus which were not previously in the possession of the Department"" from the Department of Defense and the State Inspector General. ""These emails are now in our possession and will be subject to Freedom of Information Act requests. Furthermore, we asked the IG to incorporate this matter into the review Secretary Kerry requested in March. We have also informed Congress of this matter."" 

Also on Friday, a State Department official also told CNN that in the process of turning over Libya-related emails to the Select Committee on Benghazi, it found a ""small number"" of Benghazi-related emails that had not been disclosed to the committee previously. These emails are among 925 Libya-related emails being turned over Friday and were found within the emails Clinton turned over to the State Department from her private server. The official said the emails were found because they have now been digitized and are easier to search. 

Clinton turned over to State her work-related emails from the server and kept emails she deemed personal. The email server has since been turned over to the FBI, where investigators have been able to recover both the personal and work-related emails. The FBI is looking into whether any classified materials were mishandled.",b5bd25f7-ad0d-4933-b91f-d6cc3883de73,News,2015-09-26T00:10:34Z,MyEastTex,New Hillary Clinton email chain discovered,0.0,Blog

2560,"THE white man accused of killing nine black churchgoers during a Bible study will face the death penalty, according to court documents. THE documents filed on Thursday state prosecutors would pursue the death penalty against Dylann Roof, 21, because more than two people were killed, and that others' lives were put at risk.

Prosecutors also said they intended to present evidence on Roof's mental state, adult and juvenile criminal record and other conduct, as well as his apparent lack of remorse for the killings.

Roof faces state charges including nine murder counts in the June 17 slayings at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.

He is expected in court again on those charges in October.

He also faces federal charges including hate crimes and obstruction of the practice of religion, some of which are also eligible for the death penalty in that system.

US Attorney General Loretta Lynch has said federal charges were necessary to adequately address a motive that prosecutors believe was unquestionably rooted in racial hate.

South Carolina has no state hate crimes law.

Roof is white and appeared in photos waving Confederate flags and burning or desecrating US flags.

He purportedly wrote online of fomenting racial violence, and federal authorities have said he used a personal manuscript in which he decried integration and used racial slurs to refer to blacks.",bdc95b30-e47a-45e9-8829-00c18e972de7,News,2015-09-03T19:01:13Z,Northern Territory News,Death penalty sought for 'church shooter',0.0,Blog

Yes, families at EGC are collecting bottles and cans as a way to raise funds for the REACH project. Check out our progress meter to the left—we're just over half our fundraising goal!

Designated drop-off containers can be found in the Grade School classroom at our Lima campus. For questions, please contact Emily Seymour at emilyseymour@elimgospel.org.



Take a look below to see what our Kids Ministry is teaching this week!

In the Lima Campus 34's classroom: I Can Obey—Solomon Obeys

Talk About It: God knew Solomon would obey, so He gave him a very important job. When we obey, our leaders will trust us to obey with even bigger things.

Bible Connection: ""You will be blessed if you obey the commands of the Lord your God…"" Deuteronomy 11:27 

Challenge for families: Get out some building blocks or a Lego set. Build a house together. Talk about house Solomon built a house for God. Think together about what a house for God might be like. Tell your child that God is with you right now, and that He can come and make His home in our hearts. 



In the Lima Campus 5K's classroom and the Henrietta Campus Preschool classroom: Jesus Shows Me How to Live—The Lost Coin

Talk About It: Jesus told a story about a woman who searched for a lost coin. His story shows us that we should tell those who don’t know Jesus all about God’s love. 

Bible Connection: “Follow My teachings and learn from Me...” Matthew 11:29

Challenge for families: Whenever you find some loose change, remind your child that just like this change, Jesus is always looking for those who don’t know Him.



In the Grade School classrooms: God's House—Wrap-Up

This week's main point: God is speaking to all of us about our relationship with Him. What's He saying to you?

Main verse: Luke 14:15-24 (The Parable of the Great Banquet)

Challenge for Kids: Take time to listen to God this week about your relationship with Him, and then take action on what He says!",e62b92f1-8d1b-42fb-a995-73b9432c6806,Blog,2015-09-19T14:00:46Z,EGC Kids,From Pastor Greg's Desk,1.0,News
1823,"Dear Ellen,

I almost didn't want to give over our temporary dominance of campus to the domestic students. Our beautiful, quiet, to ourselves campus was about to be stormed by probably really loud and annoying Americans who knew when to say mail instead of post and romper instead of play suit. The night before they came, I took a walk by myself around campus to just remember what it looked like before some freshmen college kids puked all over it.

[caption id=""attachment_2248"" align=""alignnone"" width=""165""] All by myself[/caption]

But come they did. A sea of orange and black, woo girls and lad packs, as well as a vast majority of very lovely and friendly people. In one day everything shifted up a gear. I heard 'oh my god I love your accent are you Australian?' at least 10 times an hour. The gym as suddenly packed with perfect girls with perfect hair (I've discovered everyone's secret is coconut oil).

[caption id=""attachment_2249"" align=""alignnone"" width=""165""] Pitch invasion[/caption]

Then came class. It really was classes, like being back in secondary school. Registration, whiteboards and homework. Nightmare. Our grade comes from attendance as well as homework and in class quizzes. I'm inclined to think this is utter bull and I should move back to the UK immediately. I also seemed to have accidentally signed up to a political science major that is far more science that politics, with threats of month long data collection hovering over the next week. However, the books I have to read for class are super interesting and stuff i probably would have picked anyway so BONUS.

Tomorrow, I start rush week, which is the recruitment week for sororities. I have no idea what to expect, except to expected the unexpected, not the movies....

1523,"By ,   
The Alexandria City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to ban the city from flying Confederate flags, and will form a citizens’ committee to study whether to change the names of streets named for Southern  military leaders. 
 
The action will not prevent parades or spectators from waving Rebel flags, council members said. And it will allow ethnic groups such as those who celebrate Irish or Scottish history from waving their flags. But the era of city staff raising a Confederate flag on Robert E. Lee’s birthday and Confederate Memorial Day is over. 

The symbols of the Confederacy in Alexandria extend far beyond the memorial statue to the Southern war dead that greets northbound travelers on Washington Street in Old Town. 

Still unsettled is the name of U.S. 1, otherwise known as Jefferson Davis Highway. More than 33 streets and a public elementary school are named after Confederate military leaders. A plaque at a prominent Old Town corner presents a skewed version of a shooting at the start of the Civil War. In the council chambers itself, a portrait of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee silently watches the civic discourse, across the room from a portrait of George Washington. 

Prompted by the shooting of nine worshippers in an African American church in Charleston, S.C., and that state’s subsequent decision to remove the Confederate flag from capitol grounds, Alexandria’s elected leaders agreed that now is the time to reconsider its celebration of its history, which includes lynchings and hosting slave trades, as well as tourist-friendly taverns from the Revolutionary War. 

“While we’re a Southern town, this is a part of our history that should not be celebrated all these many years later,” Mayor William D. Euille (D) said in July. Euille is the first African American mayor in the city’s 266-year history. The other six members of the council agreed it is time to stop raising a rebel flag on public property.  

But that leaves the matter of the other memorials and symbols. 

In a memo to the council last month, City Manager Mark Jinks said the city has full authority over the flag raising and the chamber’s Lee portrait. But limiting flags to the U.S., Virginia and city ones means that Alexandria couldn’t fly the Irish and Red Cross flags, which it does for celebrations each March, he said. 

The city’s Appomattox statue of the sad Confederate soldier cannot be removed without the authorization of the General Assembly, Jinks said. 

While the General Assembly named Jefferson Davis Highway in 1922, the stretch of the road in Alexandria was called River Road until the council changed it in 1952. The city attorney believes the council has the power under its charter to change the highway’s name again, but neighboring Arlington County does not have charter authority, so it would have to get approval from the legislature. 

“It would be logical to jointly decide on the same new name for that stretch of Jefferson Davis Highway,” Jinks wrote. 

The 1953 City Council renamed and renumbered many streets west of Old Town when it annexed what is now known as the West End. At the time, it established the protocol of naming north-south streets after Confederate military leaders, such as Gen. G.T. Beauregard, spy Frank Hume, Maj. Eli Hamilton Janney, Gen. Jubal Early and many more. In addition to the 33 streets known to be named after Southern military men, another 30 streets may have Confederate-related names, but historical documentation is lacking. 

The name of Maury Elementary School, honoring Matthew Fontaine Maury, who was responsible for Southern seacoast defenses, resides with the city’s school board. 

The Lee Center, which houses the city’s fire training center and a number of administrative offices, is on the site of the former Robert E. Lee Elementary School, which closed in 1978. But it is connected to the Nannie J. Lee Recreation Center, which is named for a notable African American teacher and the city staff can’t determine which Lee was being honored by the center’s name. 

Finally, the plaque attached to what is now Hotel Monaco, on the corner of King and Pitt streets, commemorates the 1861 fatal shooting of a Union officer by the owner of the then-Marshall House hotel. The Union officer, part of a vanguard that established Union control over Alexandria, had just removed a giant Confederate flag that flew from the roof. 

The plaque is owned by the Sons and Daughters of Confederate Veterans and is on private property, Jinks said, so the council has no control over it. The city previously announced plans to erect a more complete historical report of the incident in the next six months, part of a broader effort to create a series of “mini-kiosks” of history along King Street.",50d8bafb-cc12-4c5d-b725-3172f62a425e,News,2015-09-09T01:50:00Z,Washington Post,Alexandria Council votes to prohibit flying of Confederate flags by city,0.0,News

1680,"TOKYO — Japan reports its trade deficit narrowed in August as costs for crude oil imports plunged and exports to the U.S. showed steady growth.

The customs data released Thursday showed a 4.2 percent drop from August a year earlier in the volume of exports for the world's third-largest economy, likely mainly reflecting weakness in shipments to China.

But the value of exports rose 3.1 percent from a year earlier, while imports fell 3.1 percent. The 569.7 billion yen ($4.7 billion) deficit was the largest in seven months.

The slowdown in China's economy hit exports of steel, auto parts and metalworking machinery hardest. Exports to the U.S. rose 11 percent from a year earlier, mainly due to sales of cars and pharmaceuticals.",988ae46f-df70-413a-aea7-a744b70ef478,News,2015-09-17T00:31:00Z,Kentucky.com,Japan trade deficit narrows in August on lower oil imports,0.0,Blog

2633,"PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation's struggle to scientifically dispose of approximately 1,700 tonne garbage the city generates daily seems to have nudged the district administration and the Pune Zilla Parishad to look for solutions. 

They will set up four garbage processing units in Wagholi, Phursungi, Nanded Phata and Lohegaon on the city's fringes to take care of solid waste generated by 25 villages. A single unit will process garbage from three to four nearby villages. Civic officials said it will ease the pressure on garbage management. 

An administrative official said local waste processing units in the fringes are essential with a sharp rise in construction, population and commercial activities. The district planning and development council (DPDC) will provide some funds for the installation of the processing units. Pune Zilla Parishad has floated tenders for a detailed project report. 

At present, villages in the fringes dump solid waste as they neither have a garbage management plan nor a processing unit. Once the processing units start functioning they would ensure that this garbage does not go to Uruli-Phursungi depot or is dumped in any open area. 

A senior official said since each processing unit will require 1.5 acre of land, vacant plots are being identified and there has been no opposition, so far. The units will also give additional income to the gram panchayats, he added. 

""Each processing unit will process 25 tonne waste. Two separate plants to process wet and dry garbage may be set up. Options are being worked out for two units to produce CNG by processing garbage,"" official said.",d44f9c88-f925-4c3f-b2ef-1316aa7b410e,News,2015-09-08T20:12:44Z,Times of India,Four processing units in fringes to handle waste,0.0,News

7884,"Turning 18 can be a big moment in a teenager’s life, so it’s understandable if their parent wants to do something extra special to celebrate the milestone occasion. While some teens dream of receiving keys to a brand new car or a trip to Europe, Nicola Austen had something different in mind when it came to her daughter’s birthday present: $1,000 worth of cocaine! In January, Austen was arrested at home with about eight grams of the drug, reports the Huffington Post. The British mom told authorities of her plan to take the birthday girl out for a good time in London. Austen booked a limo and planned to take the stash with her for some drug-induced, mother-daughter bonding. Before the celebration could take place, police stopped by to talk to Austen, who had six previous convictions, including one for possessing amphetamine. That’s when a police dog found the coke. Despite the previous convictions, Austen managed to avoid serving time in jail. Earlier this week, the 37-year-old received a nine-month suspended sentence and 250 hours of community service. She was given the lighter sentence since she claimed that the drugs were only going to be used by her daughter and herself.

	The completion of the bridge portion of the St. Croix Crossing project will be delayed, the Minnesota and Wisconsin Departments of Transportation announced Friday. 
 

	The bridge was expected to open to traffic in the fall of 2016, but work will now continue into 2017. 
 

	MnDOT Commissioner Charlie Zelle called it a “very complex engineering project” and said the methods of construction are taking longer than expected. He said their highest priority is to finish the project safely and at high standards. 
 

	A new completion date will be announced by the end of the year. 
 

	The delay isn’t expected to add any new traffic impacts. Zelle says the construction work on the Minnesota side on Highway 36 is finished, and the Highway 64 roadwork in Wisconsin is on schedule.

5146,"0 FlaresFilament.io0 Flares×I met my husband and daughters in Denver after the D23 Expo as were were headed to Vail for vacation. We wanted to stay over for a couple of nights to see Denver, so we booked a night at a hotel that had a shuttle from the airport. The shuttle was free, and ran until midnight. My flight was due in at 11:45, and as typical for that kind of situation, I was delayed. $50 later, I met my family at a hotel that was adequate, but not memorable. The next day we checked into Denver’s Grand Hyatt. I later found out you can book a shuttle for $25 that will take you downtown. Sometimes a free shuttle seems like a bargain, but I sure wish we had been able to spend two nights at this fabulous hotel. If you are looking for a hotel in Denver, this is the one! It was gorgeous and centrally located so you have access to all the city has to offer. Our room was beautiful and so comfortable. If you’ve stayed at a Hyatt, I don’t have to tell you how much we love the Grand Bed Hyatt is famous for! The contemporary design is gorgeous with deluxe amenities like a safe that’s big enough for your laptop, a 42-inch flatscreen TV, a lovely bathroom with a Rain shower head and upscale bath products, plus free internet, which is always a big bonus for me. We also had large closet with robes, which I always appreciate. My husband took over the desk. It’s great when you aren’t tripping over each other! Some rooms just don’t give you enough space. The Hyatt does a great job of designing rooms so you can spread out. Including the Grand Club access is also totally worth it, in my opinion. We enjoyed the fabulous complimentary drinks and hors d’oeuovres before we went out to dinner, and came back for decaf and dessert before turning in for the night. The next morning, breakfast was outstanding. Not your typical continental breakfast, but cheeses and meats, lox, breads and muffins, eggs and all the fixings for breakfast burritos. Coffee, a huge assortment of juices, chocolate milk, and other drinks were available as well. The room is large and bright with a perfect view of the city, and there were a couple of TVs as well as the Wall Street Journal and other papers to catch up on the news. You also have access to the Grand Club suite during the day to grab cold bottles of water and other drinks or a piece of fruit. Though we didn’t eat at the hotel, we did have a glass of wine before we headed out for the evening. and the wine collection is pretty outstanding. I hope we get a chance to visit again. There will be no question about where we’ll be staying. Visit the Grant Hyatt website to book your room when visiting Denver.   Please like & share:

7581,"News Headline | Sun TV promoters have no intention of divesting stake share this on 0 0 0 Email this pagePrint this page By indiantelevision.com Team Posted on : 25 Sep 2015 08:51 pm 0 0 0 MUMBAI: Contrary to what has been reported in certain section of the media, Sun TV promoters Kalanithi Maran and his wife Kaveri Kalanithi have no intention of divesting their stake in the company.
 
In response to market speculations that Marans were looking to exit the company by divesting their shares to two private equity firms, Sun TV group chief financial officer (CFO) SL Narayanan rubbished reports while addressing the media at the company’s annual general meeting (AGM) in Chennai.
 
“The promoters have no plans to either divest or dilute their stake in the company. They will not cash out or exit Sun TV,” Narayanan firmly stated.
 
What’s more, the network is also expecting an increase in subscriptions while the Phase III and IV of the TV digitisation continues, as per Narayanan. Sun TV’s subscription income for the year ended 31 March, 2015 was Rs 738 crore as compared to Rs 644 crore during the previous year.
 
The company's ad sales revenue also witnessed a growth of 6.5 per cent at to Rs 1,136.09 crore during the year ended 31 March, 2015 as compared to Rs 1,067.04 crore during the previous year.
 
Apart from the case that Maran is fighting against charges of money laundering, the Sun TV Network was also in the news for being denied security clearance by the Ministry of Home Affairs. 
 
Moreover, according to media reports, Sun TV’s AGM also saw a shareholder raising concerns over the huge disparity in income of Kalanithi Maran and the company’s independent directors. It was reported that Maran and his wife took home a salary of Rs 61 crore each in the year ended 31 March. Juxtaposed to that, Sun TV’s independent directors get a fee of up to Rs 26,000.
 
Despite the trials and tribulations that the company has been facing over the last few months, Narayanan remained optimistic about the company’s future. “We have been through difficult times and will come out completely unscathed. I am confident, at the end, truth will prevail and we will come out (with) flying colours,” he said.",390a61e0-7bbb-4d72-bd8e-a8a35d462409,Blog,2015-09-25T15:21:17Z,Indian Television Dot Com,Sun TV promoters have no intention of divesting stake,1.0,Blog

Victor Wanyama is not expected to re-sign with Southampton, despite the Premier League club reportedly offering a five-year deal to the Kenyan international. 

The Daily Mail is reporting that Wanyama is happy to see out the current campaign with the Saints before revaluating his next move at season's end. 

Wanyama still has two years remaining on his contract at St Mary's. 

The 24-year-old was the subject of interest from Tottenham during the summer transfer window and it is understood Spurs maybe attempt to lure Wanyama to White Hart Lane again in January. 

Southampton executive director Les Reed said the club was preparing to discuss a new long-term deal with Wanyama. 

""We've already tried to start negotiations on that. We've offered him the opportunity for a long-term extension,"" Reed said. 

""We'd like to tie him down for another five years. Whether that's possible or not, I don't know but the opportunity is there to do that. 

""He was a little bit unsettled and I think that has to happen probably at most clubs with different players. 

""The speculation does raise a few eyebrows. 

""Maybe it got a little bit too hyped up and maybe Victor thought there was a bit more truth in the rumours than there was. 

""Now it's over, he's gone home to Kenya and I think he'll enjoy some time with his family and come back and be settled and raring to go in our team.""

466,"21 years after the first and so far only Coopers release on Kimmo Rapatti’s DUM label, Jukka Kaartinen & Rapatti join forces again for their second output ever. 
 
I guess you can say that this release is both futuristic and retrospective at the same time but thanks to a freshly structured sound design, which doesn’t try to emulate the past in a plastic way, all three tracks come across convincingly and, gulp, honest. 
 
‘Indianacid’ is summery and positive; an immersion into the last bits of sunshine playfully reflecting on the surface of the countless lakes of Finland. It seems like the Coopers boys set out from shore to go on a serious salmon fishing mission with a 303 in the bag and this became the result. 
 
On the other hand, ‘Ixam’ is one ferocious, beaver teeth grinding jam, in ecstatic analogue delirium. Think earlier Mono Junk darkness and you should get an idea, where this is heading. Gloom’n’Glory surely seems like an appropriate description here. 
 
‘Maximalfun’ aka a 12:34 minutes restrained roller coaster ride with endless, repetitive sonic musters completes the mental clusterfuck and I expect to see at least a good number of dingy ravers in spasmodic state, getting killed slowly by this. If not, the the sun will do the job. 
 
With love from Finland!

6088,"This weekend we celebrated our 7th Tiziversary. Where has the time gone?   Seems like only yesterday that we met our precious little Tizita getting off a plane in Appleton. She had just left the only home she had ever known in Ethiopia and was stepping into her new life as a part of our family. What a great day it was! We celebrate her Tiziversary every Sept.12 or thereabouts. We always have a special cake and give her a present or two. We also try to do a special activity. This year, for the second year, we walked in the  Brigg's and Al Walk for Children's Hospital. The walk takes place in Milwaukee. There are so many people all walking for a great cause. It always humbles me to see all the T shirts in honor or memory of so many child champions.  It was a beautiful day for the three mile walk. After the walk, we enjoyed a lunch at the Ethiopian Village Restaurant. It was delicious as usual. John and I brought the girls home while Courtney, Paul, and Alissa stopped for a beer on the way home. We had yogurt at the new Cenex Yogurt place and then went over to St. John's to use Tizita's new volleyball which was a gift from us for the Tiziversary. We all had pizza and beers at On the Rock and then while the girls went out with Mallory, John, Soli, Tiz, and I watched TV. It was a perfectly wonderful celebration of a fantastic little lady! Here are some photos of the day: Today we all went to church and then after lunch everyone left to go home. John, mom, and I put fall decorations on the cemetery and now we wait for the Packers who play later tonight.  ",499b12be-b5ee-4e07-a95f-88687cc770ce,Blog,2015-09-20T23:42:09Z,Living the good life in Grandmaville,Celebrating a 7th Tiziversary,1.0,News

4550,"I'd fancied getting a colouring book for ages, and the compact size of The Mindfulness Colouring Book by Emma Farrarons really appealed to me. I also loved the wave design shown on the cover, which reminded me of Chinese and Japanese art. The size of the book means it is perfect for keeping in my desk drawer at work, so that I can use it to unwind at breaktimes and lunchtimes. However, I do find that I tend to get interrupted if I sit at my desk, so I've found a quiet spot I can escape to at lunchtimes if I want peace! Unfortunately there isn't space in my desk drawer for the huge box of coloured pencils shown here, either, I have to make do with a much smaller selection! There's a good variety of designs in the book, abstract, floral, teacups, a cat, waves, and much more! I did start colouring them in in the sequence they appear in the book, but then I started to just flick through the book and choose the pattern that most appealed to me that day. It's fun trying to choose the best colours for each design, and colouring the designs really is a good way of unwinding because you forget about everything else.",bfe5dee7-37d9-487c-91bd-4209e40f1985,Blog,2015-09-14T07:00:04Z,emuse,Book review: The Mindfulness Colouring Book,1.0,News
6429,"Steve Rannazzisi , a comedian and star of FX's The League , admitted Tuesday that a story he's frequently repeated about escaping the Twin Towers on 9/11 was a lie. On multiple occasions, Rannazzisi has said that he was working for Merrill Lynch in the South Tower of the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001. ""The first tower got hit and we were, like, jostled all over the place,"" he said in an interview on Marc Maron's podcast in 2009, going on to describe running out of the building minutes before the second plane hit, and the dreams that have haunted him ever since. Rannazzisi has taken his 9/11 account a step further, attributing his narrow escape to his subsequent success in the entertainment business. After adopting a ""life is short"" approach, Rannazzisi has said, he quit his desk job in New York and moved to Los Angeles to forge a career in comedy. In 2003, he was cast on Ashton Kutcher's Punk'd . Celebrities who have been caught lying But on Tuesday, after the New York Times  noted that Merrill Lynch did not have offices in the World Trade Center and has no record of Rannazzisi ever being an employee, he recanted his story. ""I was not at the Trade Center on that day,"" he told the Times in a statement.. ""I don't know why I said this. This was inexcusable. I am truly, truly sorry."" He continued: ""It was profoundly disrespectful to those who perished and those who lost loved ones. The stupidity and guilt I have felt for many years has not abated. It was an early taste of having a public persona, and I made a terrible mistake. All I can ask is for forgiveness."" Rannazzisi said that, after his initial fabrication - which he calls ""a story told by an immature young man"" - the lie spiraled out of control. ""It only made me more ashamed,"" he said in his statement. ""How could I tell my children to be honest when I hadn't come clean about this?""

680,"For the first time, the Food and Drug Administration has ordered a major tobacco company to stop selling brands of cigarettes. 

The FDA on Tuesday ordered the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company to stop selling for brands: Camel Bold Crush, Vantage Tech 13 and the regular and menthol versions of Pall Mall Deep Set Recessed Filter cigarettes. 

The FDA has ordered other cigarettes off the market before, but those actions involved much smaller companies selling much less popular cigarettes. 

The agency says it took the action because R.J. Reynolds had failed to prove the brands were no more dangerous than brands that have been on the market longer. 

""These decisions were based on a rigorous, science-based review designed to protect the public from the harms caused by tobacco use,"" Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, said in a statement. ""The agency will continue to review product submissions and exercise it's legal authority and consumer protection duty to remove products from the market when they fail to meet the public health bar set forth under law."" 

Congress gave the FDA authority to regulate cigarettes for the first time in 2009. Among the agency's new powers are the authority to require new brands to prove they pose no more risks to smokers than cigarettes that were put on the market before Feb. 15, 2007. 

The FDA says R.J. Reynolds had failed to show the four brands that have been ordered off the market do not expose smokers to more harmful chemicals, higher levels of menthol or new ingredients.

3907,"In the video, the man is seen approaching the fence with a bag in his hand. He kneels down and lures the three dogs on the premises to the fence,  Brakpan Herald  reported. 
 
Click here to watch the video. 
 
Shortly afterwards, he grabs the puppy named Angel, pulls him through the fence and places the puppy in the bag before casually walking away. 
 
When the the dog owner, Teresa Ajudia, checked the footage, she was horrified to see how the suspect stole their puppy. She then took to social media in an effort to trace the man. 
 
She reportedly received a call from a person who gave her a tip-off on who to phone. After she had tried many times, someone apparently answered on the other end and told her where to go. 
 
On Sunday morning, Teresa arrived at the address with a security company and saw the man who had taken Angel from her yard. 
 
She confronted him and managed to grab Angel. 
 
A woman at the house brought a collar to Ajudia and asked her if it was her dog’s collar. 
 
“I looked at the collar and immediately recognised it,” Ajudia said. 
 
“She then showed me to a room and opened the door just a little bit. I couldn’t see clearly what was going on inside that room, but Angel wasn’t the only dog there. After I called his name and hoped he would respond, I felt his soft fur against my hand and immediately took him from that dark room. I don’t know what’s going on there or what they’re doing to these dogs, but they all seemed like family pets that didn’t belong there,” she added. 
 
Teresa took Angel to a veterinarian, who said Angel had picked up cat flu and is going through a lot of stress at the moment. 
 
This incident was reported at the Brakpan Police Station.

3205,"(CNN) -  
Six Baltimore police officers charged in Freddie Gray's death are in court for a pretrial hearing Wednesday as the city braces for what could happen afterward. 
 
The hearing comes almost five months after Gray suffered a fatal spinal injury in custody while being transported in a police van. 

""Mr. Gray suffered a severe and critical neck injury as a result of being handcuffed, shackled by his feet and unrestrained inside of the (Baltimore police) wagon,"" Marilyn Mosby, the state's attorney for the city of Baltimore, said in announcing the charges in May. 

The six officers face charges ranging from assault to vehicular manslaughter. All six have pleaded not guilty. 

And the case could get more complicated as attorneys for the officers have called for Mosby to drop the charges -- or at least recuse herself. They say Mosby's office had issued orders for police to crack down on the area where Gray was arrested. 

The trial of the ""Freddie Gray Six"" is scheduled to begin in October. On Wednesday, the officers' attorneys will seek a ruling on the pretrial motions they have filed. 

Several things could happen during the pretrial hearing, including: 

• Mosby's office could be recused. 

• The case could be dismissed for prosecutorial misconduct. 

• The court could discuss how and whether the officers will be tried, together or separately. 

City on alert 

Activists were planning protests at the Baltimore City Circuit Court's east courthouse, situated behind City Hall, and elsewhere Wednesday. About an hour before the hearing, some people had gathered outside the courthouse, holding yellow signs calling for justice in Gray's case. 

""Freddie Gray didn't have to die!"" demonstrators shouted. 

Baltimore police hope demonstrations will stay peaceful but are taking precautions in case they don't. 

The police department has canceled leave for officers Wednesday in case violence breaks out. 

""We would rather err on the side of caution and have an abundance of people readily available as needed,"" Lt. Sarah Connolly said. ""We are hoping we don't need them."" 

After Gray's funeral in April, Baltimore descended into chaos as buildings went up in flames and vandalism and looting devastated local businesses. 

It was the exact opposite of what Gray's family had sought. 

""I want y'all to get justice for my son,"" Gray's mother said at the time. ""But don't do it like this here."" 

Officers and charges 

These are the six officers and their charges: 

• Officer Caesar R. Goodson Jr. is charged with one count of second-degree depraved-heart murder, involuntary manslaughter, second-degree assault, manslaughter by vehicle (gross negligence), manslaughter by vehicle (criminal negligence), misconduct in office and reckless endangerment. 

• Officer Garrett E. Miller is charged with one count of second-degree assault, two counts of misconduct in office and one count of reckless endangerment. 

• Officer Edward M. Nero is charged with one count of second-degree assault, two counts of misconduct in office and one count of reckless endangerment. 

• Officer William G. Porter is charged with one count of involuntary manslaughter, second-degree assault, misconduct in office and reckless endangerment.",27ae5d1a-2c4c-4199-a8d2-43e3f955c176,News,2015-09-02T15:14:41Z,KION 46,Freddie Gray case: Baltimore cops in court,0.0,News

8651,"A threat actor group is resurfacing the TVSPY malware, which takes advantage of a vulnerability in Teamviewer software version 6, a legitimate tool used for remote PC administration. This time though, the perpetrators are bundling Teamviewer v6 in a package with a copy of the malware. “This particular threat is very dangerous as the attacker will have total control over the affected machine,” said researchers at Damballa, who uncovered the threat. “It can be used during a regular infection campaign or by some APT actors for specific attacks against particular targets.” Most recently, a targeted email campaign included a malicious Excel file with a macro that downloads the malware. The email was impersonating the All-Russian Research and Design Institute of Nuclear and Energy Engineering; and the analysis of the Command and Control server for this latest variant appears to be owned by professional criminals. Damballa noted that the number of unique variants seen in 2015 is 4.4 times the number seen in 2012, and 2.2 times that seen in all of 2014. There are some instances of Dridex installing this malware as well. “This malware has been relatively quiet for more than two years so the nearly three-fold increase in activity is concerning,” the researchers said. TVSPY, also known as TVRAT, SpY-Agent or teamspy, was originally developed in 2010 by a hacker going by the handle Mr. Burns. He also created something similar called RMS, which behaves very much like the TVSPY builder. “RMS/TVSPY continues to be developed, with a new version being posted by the developer/reseller on a regular basis,” Damballa researchers noted. “In fact, the legitimate RMS version developed by TektonIT and the version posted in criminal forums appear to be identical. TVSPY seems to be merely a modification of RMS to utilize TeamViewer infrastructure and a command-and-control interface manageable through the Web.”",1266ff71-f947-471b-9219-4f3965198189,Blog,2015-09-04T13:54:16Z,Damballa,TVSPY Returns in Force,1.0,News

We spend a lot of our time at work, so it’s definitely beneficial to try to make our working hours the best experience possible, under the circumstances. There are a lot of things that weigh on our minds at work, job performance among them. Unfortunately, sometimes there are some recurring thoughts of self-doubt that hold us back from being and doing our very best. Here’s what to do about them.“This is just a temporary job.” 
Maybe you are not at your dream job. And even if you are one of the lucky ones who loves what he does, there is always room for more, right? You can always grow and reach new heights. But that doesn’t mean that just because you’re not at your dream job, it’s okay to slack off.
Wherever you are right now, make the most of it. If you are not putting in the effort because you think this job is only temporary, you are not giving yourself or anyone else your best. This will only hurt your growth in the end. It’ll be harder to get good references and you’ll get into the habit of putting it the least amount of effort, so that if you end up getting your dream job, you may not perform as well as you could have, so used to slacking off you’ll be.“I’m not enough”
“I’m not smart enough, skinny enough, fast enough, just not enough.” Stop this right now! If you have a job, obviously someone thought you were the person for it. Comparing yourself to co-workers is not good for anyone. I know it sounds cliché, but you truly do have talents that not everyone has. Is it your quirky optimism? Your ability to stay on task? Your charisma that rallies the troops? Figure out what you have to bring to your work environment and bring it.“Someone else will do it”
Sometimes we put off offering a hand or taking on tasks at work because we think someone else will do it. I do not know who this “someone else” is, but it could always be you. If you see something that needs to be changed or someone that could use some help, why not pitch in? You may end up standing out for it. Be known for being helpful.“It’s too risky”
Success takes risks. If we are always afraid of making a wrong move, we will hold our creativity back and never step forward. The fear of speaking up in a meeting, sharing an idea to improve that marketing campaign, or confronting a coworker about behavior that makes you uncomfortable. Your best work depends on your willingness to take calculated risks and go for the gold. The result can be a better environment for all.

2733,"Can you trust the FACT vans to pick you up for an appointment or for a doctor’s appointment or to go to church on Sunday? Well, I can’t. Many times I’m told I’m not on the list. 
      
I want to be in the church by 9 a.m. Last Sunday, he came at 9:30 a.m. and said I’m to be picked up at 9:30 a.m. I think the driver does what he wants to do. 
 
Wednesday I had a doctor’s appointment. I got to the doctor’s office at 1:45 p.m. That was good. Twenty minutes later, a van driver came into the waiting room and asked if I was ready to go home. I hadn’t even seen the doctor yet and I never saw the van driver again. The office girls had called two times after seeing the doctor. They called again. They were closing the office. At that time, a van pulled up. It started to rain and a pleasant driver said it wasn’t his fault. 
 
Then there was Sept. 13. It must have been one of those that think they’re the boss and do as they please. I saw a van go through the parking lot at least 25 miles an hour with no thought of stopping.

6497,"With fall in the air, your thoughts may turn to what needs to be done to your home before winter sets in. Many tasks are done much more easily when the weather is still nice. Plus, taking care of routine maintenance tasks now can save you aggravation and money down the road. 


 ""If you don't do these things and you end up having to do repairs, it can cost so much more later,"" says Leah Ingram, cost advisor for HomeAdvisor.com and a frugal living expert who publishes the site SuddenlyFrugal.com. 


 She recalls that one year she didn't have leaves removed from the roof of her New Jersey home, which would have cost about $300 for a professional crew to complete the job. The result was an ice dam that caused $3,000 in damage from water leaks inside the house. 


 Many fall maintenance routines are designed to prevent water damage and guard homeowners from safety hazards , especially from fires. ""Water is a homeowner's worst enemy,"" Ingram says. ""People don't think about the kind of damage it can do."" 


 The use of fireplaces, candles and space heaters, all more common in winter, can be a fire hazard if you don't keep up with routine safety measures. ""Unfortunately, house fires are fairly common in the winter months,"" says Anne Reagan, editor-in-chief of Porch.com, which publishes advice for homeowners and matches them with professionals who do home repairs and maintenance tasks. 


 While homeowners can do some routine tasks themselves, others such as inspecting chimneys and repairing roofs, are best left to professionals. HomeAdvisor, which matches homeowners with contractors, publishes a True Cost Guide of how much homeowners pay for various jobs. As cold weather approaches, it may get harder to get appointments, and you may also be less inclined to go outside and work, making it crucial to plan ahead and knock out projects in fall. 


 ""The fall is a really busy time usually for homeowners,"" Reagan says. ""It's when we start preparing for winter. … When it's really cold and wet outside, you don't want to do those things you need to do."" 


 Even if you live in an area where snow and ice aren't likely, fall is still a good time to catch up with routine maintenance. Water and falling branches can cause equally expensive damage in the tropics as it does in the snowbelt. 


 Here are 15 fall home maintenance tasks to tackle now: 

 Clean gutters and downspouts. Leaves and debris gather in gutters, which can cause ice dams and other water damage when snow falls and then melts, or during rainstorms. This is an easy task to do yourself if you can climb a ladder safely. 

 Remove leaves. Not only do you want the leaves out of your gutters, you want them off your roof and off your lawn. Despite what some may believe, letting leaves decay on your lawn does not provide fertilizer. ""It's actually helping fungus and mold build up, which can kill your lawn,"" Ingram says. 

 Repair any damage to your roof . ""Anywhere you had shingle damage, that needs to be fixed and replaced,"" says J.B. Sassano, president of Mr. Handyman, which franchises handyman services nationwide. If water can get under your shingles, it can get into your home and cause damage. 

 Clean your chimney. Have a chimney sweep come in every year to check your fireplace for safety and clean out the remains of last year's fires. ""If you use your fireplace regularly with wood, you've got to get that soot out of there,"" Ingram says. You also want to make sure that the cover to your chimney is intact and that birds or other critters haven't chosen to move in, Sassano says. 

 Check smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors. It's smart to test the devices and replace the batteries every six months, making this a chore for fall and spring. Also, make sure you have enough fire extinguishers and that they are in the right place. 

 Change filters in heating and air conditioning units. Most forced-air systems work better when the filters are clean. While some filters are advertised to last several months, people with pets or old houses with a lot of dust should change filters monthly. 

 Caulk around the windows . Cold air can easily enter your house around windows. Caulking wears out after a few years. This is a chore many homeowners can do themselves for less than $2",64bd60aa-1c95-40e5-a2fe-d34b9448d0a7,News,2015-09-29T14:59:54Z,US News & World Report,15 Fall Maintenance Tasks Every Homeowner Should Tackle Now,0.0,Blog

""The Journey to Space Exhibition and 3D Film explores both the history and bright future of human space travel, along with the risks and innovative solutions involved,"" said Jeffrey N. Rudolph 

Journey to Space: The Exhibition offers hands-on and multimedia experiences 

Guests will get a hands-on, climb-aboard experience at what it takes to live and work in space. The exhibition examines the extraordinary environment of space, including the very real dangers astronauts face during their mission above-Earth and the adaptations that engineers have developed to help them survive. Visitors will learn about the vacuum of space, radiation, meteoroids, and temperature extremes, while getting a look at all of the ways in which the forbidding environment of space can challenge human exploration.

Guests will find hands-on activities to explore the science of getting to space. This includes learning about ""weightlessness"" and how it affects the body during a long-term space mission. An experiment with water rockets, varying the amount of air and water used as fuel, will allow them to observe the physics of the launch. Another interactive uses drop towers, which lift items up high and drop them in a free-fall, to demonstrate how familiar objects behave differently in the weightless environment of space.

Visitors will experience the sights, sounds, and smells on board an orbiting space station like the International Space Station (ISS), and try their hands at some of the engineering feats that support astronauts who live in space. Through games, multimedia components, and interactive exhibits, guests will find out how astronauts eat, sleep, and even use the restroom in space. They'll encounter firsthand the difficulties of working in space – from operating a robotic arm like astronauts on the space shuttle, to managing the limited power supply available to keep life support systems running, to discovering why working in a pressurized glove in the vacuum of space is so difficult.

Journey to Space: The Exhibition features a full-scale replica of the Destiny Lab, the primary research facility for U.S. payloads on the ISS. With its rotating mechanism, guests stepping into the Destiny Lab will have their sense of orientation challenged as they get a virtual tour from astronauts who have worked there.

Along the way, they will see incredible footage from past missions of crews living and working in space, as well as interviews in which astronauts reflect on the trials and accomplishments of their unique line of work.

Journey to Space: The Exhibition was designed and developed by the Science Museum of Minnesota 

Journey to Space 3D film unveils new era of deep space exploration

Narrated by film and television legend Sir Patrick Stewart 

Through visually stunning imagery, and in collaboration with leading space experts, Journey to Space 3D showcases the exciting plans NASA and the space community are developing and the challenges they must overcome to carry out future missions that once seemed impossible, like landing astronauts on Mars. It calls attention to the reality that the space program did not die with the end of the Shuttle Program -- it is vibrantly alive today. 

""No longer science fiction, a human mission to Mars is in the planning stages, and major steps are being taken to make it a reality within a generation,"" said Bob Kresser 

Looking ahead to the future, the film explores the newest technology in space exploration:

Journey to Space 3D gives a fitting tribute to the Space Shuttle Program and the 355 astronauts who flew on the 135 Shuttle missions. This historical chapter in the film reveals how the Shuttle took many of the big steps that helped us understand how to live and operate in space. In fact, the lessons learned during those many steps that have enabled the future missions being planned today.

The film also gives a strong overview of the Shuttle's last major project – the launch and assembly of the International Space Station (ISS). The ISS is a joint collaboration of 15 nations, operating 24/7 and providing a true home and science lab in space. While ISS crews' tours of duty have averaged six months in the past, NASA began one-year duration missions this year. Researchers expect the one-year mission to yield beneficial knowledge on the medical, psychological and biomedical challenges explorers may face as they venture to an asteroid, Mars and beyond.

Journey to Space 3D provides a timely review of how NASA has been transitioning from the end of the Space Shuttle Era to a much more ambitious future that will forever change how we live and operate in space as a species. 

Journey to Space 3D, presented by Toyota and Boeing, is a co-production of K2 Films and Giant Screen films, written and directed by Mark Krenzien

4214,"A campaign aimed at reducing unnecessary medicines waste has been launched by health commissioners in Sefton.
NHS Southport and Formby CCG and NHS South Sefton CCG estimate that an incredible £2 million is lost each year through wasted medicines that could have otherwise been spent on health services for local residents.
The campaign calls upon patients and carers to:Only order what they needReturn their unwanted medicines to their pharmacy for safe disposalTake their medicines with them when they go into hospitalDr Rob Caudwell, chair of NHS Southport and Formby CCG, said:“ One of the biggest problems is repeat prescriptions, which are ordered and collected by patients but then not used.
“Unwanted medicines in the home may mean that patients are not getting the full benefit they could from their prescriptions. It also represents a large amount of waste, with around £90 million worth of unused prescription medicines in people’s homes across the UK at any one time. With a few simple considerations, people could help save the NHS millions each year.”In Sefton, the £2 million that could potentially be saved through better medicine management could be spent on:79 more nurses OR2,000 more drug treatment courses for Alzheimer’s OR132 more drug treatment courses for breast cancer OR539 more hip replacements OR2,081 more cataract operationsDr Craig Gillespie, chair of NHS South Sefton CCG, added:“ We want patients on repeat prescriptions to think about what they are ordering and only ask for what they need and are running out of. Any of their medicines can be dispensed when needed at a later date, as once medicines have been dispensed, they cannot be recycled.
“In addition, we are encouraging everyone involved in prescribing, dispensing or reviewing medicines to make sure that their patients are fully involved in making decisions about their treatment, to ensure that more people take their medicines correctly because they have a fuller understanding of why it’s important to take medications as they’re recommended to.”Around half of the UK population do not take or use their medicines as prescribed. This can occur for a number of reasons, including:
Patients not believing the medicine is necessaryPossible side effectsFitting taking or using medicines into daily routinesChoosing between medicines if patients’ feel they are taking too manyCutting down or stopping medicines they have been taking for a long timeHealth professionals across the region have joined forces in a bid to inform patients and carers about their treatment and to help people understand more about their medicines and the options they have.
Susanne Lynch, head of medicines management for both CCGs, said:“This campaign is a great example of doctors, pharmacies, hospitals and care homes working together to raise awareness amongst patients and carers of this important issue, and people will be able to pick up a leaflet from their GP practice or local pharmacy to find out more.”She concluded:“We’d also encourage anyone with questions about their medicines, no matter how small, to speak to their pharmacist or doctor who will be able to give help and advice about getting the most from their medicines. It’s so important that people take their medicines as directed to ensure they get the maximum benefit, and health professionals will be more than happy to answer people’s queries or concerns.”         
Posters and leaflets are being displayed in pharmacies, GP practices and hospitals.

9927,"Ice Spy: US Builds Up Arctic Intelligence NetworkSputnik News12:49 12.09.2015(updated 13:03 12.09.2015) The United States seems to have finally understood that it is losing something in the Arctic; but instead of mobilizing its resources for the development of the region, it has opted to build up its spy network there to watch and listen to what the others are doing, especially Russia.Over the last 14 months, most of the 16 US intelligence agencies have assigned analysts to work full time on re-acquainting themselves with the Arctic, according to reports in the local media.The Office of the Director of National Intelligence recently convened a 'strategy board' to bring the analysts together so they could compare notes about what is happening at the top of the world.""The US intelligence focus is chiefly aimed at Russia's military buildup in the far north under President Vladimir Putin. The country's Northern Fleet is based above the Arctic Circle at Murmansk,"" states the LA Times.The reason for such scrutiny is the complaint of Alaska Gov. Bill Walker that his state has found itself ""in the middle of the pond, feeling a little bit uncomfortable with the military drawdown"", adding that ""while the US is closing bases and shedding troops, Russia is reopening 10 bases and building four more"".Canada, one of the five countries that have territory in the Arctic region, has also joined in and has refurbished a listening post called Canadian Forces Station (CFS) Alert at the northern tip of Ellesmere Island, about 500 miles (800 km) from the North Pole. It was once part of the Distant Early Warning line, a system of radar stations that watched for incoming Russian bombers or missiles.'It was thought to be a relic of the Cold War,' the news outlet quotes Rob Huebert, a professor in Arctic affairs at the University of Calgary as saying. 'Now it is a critical element of an intelligence system that monitors a part of the world that few have access to.'About 100 intelligence officers stationed at CFS Alert are trying to intercept Russian aircraft and submarine communications and other signal intelligence that they will then share with US intelligence agencies.Norway, another surrounding member state, is also participating. Its advanced spy ship, The Marjata, was specifically built to collect electronic intelligence.It has been getting restocked with new equipment and systems since April at the US Naval Weapons Station Yorktown in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia, adjacent to Camp Peary, the CIA's training base for clandestine operatives.The ship, which is operated by the Norwegian Intelligence Service, is scheduled to leave in November. It will patrol the Barents Sea, on the Atlantic side of the Arctic, to eavesdrop on Russian military activities.In May 2013 the White House issued an 11-page national strategy, challenging federal agencies to 'improve [the US] awareness of activities, conditions and trends in the Arctic region that may affect [the US] safety, security, environmental or commercial interests.'Officials said that was a wake-up call to intelligence officials to pay more heed to the activities in the Arctic.� SputnikNEWSLETTERJoin the GlobalSecurity.org mailing listEnter Your Email Address",663e2374-b29d-4a97-833f-2d23d67a85e1,Blog,2015-09-12T22:40:59Z,GlobalSecurity.org,Ice Spy: US Builds Up Arctic Intelligence Network,1.0,News

7,"Just in time for the holiday shopping seasons, Apple has announced a series of hardware upgrades for the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV. iPhone's price sees steep increaseAll the Apple announcements Just in time for the holiday shopping season, Apple has announced a series of hardware upgrades for the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV. With the iPhone, the company added a feature called 3D Touch, which lets users control some of the software by exerting pressure on the touch screen. The Apple TV got its first big upgrade in more than three years with a more powerful chip and a redesigned remote control. Apple's family of iPads also gained a bigger sibling with the iPad Pro, a tablet with a 12.9-inch screen — much larger than the older 9.7-inch iPad.

At the event, I tried out the new products in a demonstration booth. Here are some first impressions: iPhone

The 3D Touch capability is the iPhone's signature new feature. Pressing down on the screen starts different actions, depending on how much force is exerted.

A light press on an email, for example, shows a preview of the message, and a hard press then opens the email. You can also press down hard on an app icon to open shortcuts to different actions — for example, pushing down on the Instagram app shows a list of next steps, including the ability to create a new post. When you press down hard, the device responds with a tapping sensation.

I found the new iPhones pretty straightforward to use. The 3D Touch feature is easy to get used to, and I quickly figured out how to create a new calendar appointment by pressing down hard on the calendar app icon.

The new smartphones are also slightly thicker and heavier than their predecessors, though I confess I noticed that only after reading the specifications on Apple's website and not when holding the devices. iPad

The iPad Pro's jumbo screen obviously gives more room for content to breathe, but interacting with it still feels the same as with older iPad tablets.

The iPad Pro is capable of running two full-size iPad apps on the screen at the same time. The previous iPad Air 2 could run two apps at the same time, but with a primary app taking up a larger portion of the screen.

The large device will be familiar to most because apart from its size, it works the same as previous versions of the tablet. The big-screen iPad also felt comfortable to hold. It weighs about 680 grams, which is the same weight as the very first iPad. Apple TV

The Apple TV is significantly different from past models. The software interface has a white background and vivid colours, similar to Apple's Music app. The new remote control includes a touch pad for scrolling around the menu and a microphone for finding things to watch using Siri, Apple's voice assistant. The remote also includes motion sensors for gaming.

I decided to have some fun by asking Siri to help me navigate content on Apple TV. For example, I tried using Siri to steer a spaceship in a Star Wars game. But that was difficult, perhaps because of my inexperience with the game.

I also tried searching for action movies and comedy movies with the remote control's microphone. Siri misunderstood me when I said ""comedy,"" thinking I had said ""comity."" But it did a better job with action movies — when I said ""show me action movies,"" Siri brought up a list of titles including Mad Max and Furious 7.

The new remote control is thicker than the previous one, and in this case, that's a good thing. The previous Apple TV remote was so thin that it had a tendency to disappear between couch cushions.

Brian Wilcove is a partner with Artiman Ventures.How to join the network The ’80s were fun, fabulous and economically stimulating. What brought us Michael Jackson, the Sony Walkman, Star Wars and Pac-Man also ushered in the era of Analytics. Toyota pioneered just-in-time manufacturing, retailers deployed bar code scanners and ATMs became widespread. The world was being digitized. Access to data enabled enterprises to begin to optimize the location of goods and services, segment customers and enhance the financial management of businesses. Over the next 20 years, the Analytics 1.0 stack was defined and built to serve these purposes. However, Analytics 1.0 was primarily a store-and-retrieve paradigm (e.g., databases) for reporting, and was designed for a few key users, namely the C-Suite executives. Asking for a new report involved an army of consultants and millions of dollars to implement. Therefore, it was too costly to integrate the analytics software into the operational business lines of a company and democratize the data. It was ivory tower software only. This market consolidated as it reached maturity. Business Objects acquired Crystal Dynamics, and was subsequently bought by SAP ($6.8 billion). SAP then bought Sybase ($5.8 billion). IBM acquired Cognos ($4.9 billion), SPSS ($1.2 billion) and Ascential ($1.1 billion). Oracle bought Hyperion ($3.3 billion). And on it went, until there were only a handful of big players remaining. Fast-forward to 2004; the iPhone was released, Google published a paper on MapReduce and Hadoop was open-sourced. The timing was perfect: A flood of data was unleashed on the world, and technologies that made it cheaper and easier to analyze petabytes, not terabytes, of information were now available. The era of “Big Data,” or Analytics 2.0, was born, and the rebuilding of the analytics stack started again. This reinvention was largely a technology replacement wave, where the stack remained the same and each technology component was replaced with a newer cheaper/faster version of its former self. Analytics 2.0 has been fortunate to ride a few concurrent big waves, including the consumerization of IT, mobile computing and a radically lower cost of infrastructure (“the cloud”). Most of the venture capital dollars that have been invested in this market have gone toward building out the next generation platform or enabling technologies such as Hadoop distributions (Cloudera, Hortonworks, MapR) and NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, Neo4J, Greenplum, Asterdata, Netezza).
We’ve already seen early M&A activity in this market, as incumbent vendors acquire technologies to help them migrate their legacy Analytics 1.0 stack to the newer generation. As these mature, more consolidation will occur as the big players look to build out their 2.0 stacks, much the same way 1.0 was consolidated. As the Analytics 2.0 wave gets consolidated, and the large incumbent vendors acquire technologies to fashion their new stacks after the architectures of the 1.0 technology bases, a new analytics wave is already approaching. Analytics 3.0, or Operational Analytics, is the ability to sense and react in real-time to events that impact customers, machines and devices. This next wave will finally realize what analytics has always promised but has yet to deliver, and that’s embedded, or operational, analytics. Data that is analyzed and introduced to help humans and machines make decisions in real-time with context. Data exists everywhere now: on phones, TVs, bike sensors, traffic lights or even in pills you swallow. But the benefit will come from the correlation and synthesis of disparate data sources to drive automated, educated decisions. One example could include correlating your personal health history with a genetic test and a diagnostic pill you swallow that takes images of your insides. Based on the results, your doctor may decide to prescribe a cocktail of drugs for you, which would normally not be used in combination with one another, but its effect provides a dramatic improvement in your life. Companies working in this arena include Foundation Medicine, Cellworks and 23andMe. There are other great examples emerging. Many of which correlate your personal data gathered from sensors, the web, etc. with your location or particular context. Identifying why you are calling customer service ahead of the agent answering and suggesting what to do (Guavus); preventing e-commerce fraud (Feedzai); or precision agriculture, which is the action of observing, measuring and responding to inter- and intra-field variability in crops (AgSmarts, The Climate Corp., Farmeron). One of my favorite examples, maybe a bit further out in the future, includes the combination of a sophisticated AI with Analytics 3.0. In this case your autonomous vehicle analyzes your family’s schedule, picks up your daughter from school and swings by the grocery store to pick up the usual dinner ingredients for Wednesday night. The next five years will be very exciting for the analytics business, as the promise of automated intelligence and action based on disparate data will finally become commonplace. 0

Australia would use a seat on the United Nation's chief human rights body to wage a tireless campaign to end the death penalty around the world, Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said during a speech to the UN's General Assembly. 

As she spoke on Tuesday evening in the US, the state of Georgia was preparing to execute a woman despite a direct appeal from the Pope , who left America after his visit earlier this week. 

Ms Bishop's speech was in effect a ringing endorsement of the UN. Aside from the decision to bid for a seat on the UN's Human Rights Council for the 2018-2020 term, Ms Bishop formally announced Australia's decision to run again for a seat on the Security Council in 2029. 

""Australia's recent experience as a Security Council member confirmed that the council's role is more essential than ever,"" she told the General Assembly. 

She said the UN carries out crucial work in an increasingly hostile world, and is often not recognised for its successes. 

She offered her support for the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, unanimously adopted by the UN, saying that should they be realised, ""we will transform our world"". 

She also emphasised the importance of gender equality, saying it must be fully achieved by 2030. 

""We must step up the fight against the global scourge of violence against women and girls,"" she said, informing the assembly about the $100 million women's safety package the government had announced domestically. 

Speaking earlier Ms Bishop said concerns of the UN's special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Francois Crepeau, about Australia's mandatory detention policy did not conflict with the bid to secure a seat on the Human Rights Council. She said she had spoken with Mr Crepeau and made the government's case that Australia's policy of deterrence saved lives by tackling people smuggling. 

The government's engagement with the UN has apparently ticked up since Malcolm Turnbull became Prime Minister. 

It is understood that planning for Australia's bid for the Human Rights Council began under the previous government, but that Tony Abbott had instructed to Ms Bishop to abandon the effort. 

She had not yet informed the UN of that order before he left office. 

Ms Bishop said she proposed to Mr Turnbull that Australia run again for the Security Council and he had immediately approved the bid. 

Ms Bishop earlier attended a leaders summit on countering Islamic State chaired by US President Barack Obama on the sidelines of the General Assembly. 

She told the meeting of about 100 leaders that the coalition fighting IS had brought the terrorist group's expansion in Iraq to an end and forced it to change tactics. 

As a result the coalition's strategy must respond. 

""Colleagues, our campaign must continue to evolve and our strategy adapt as the situation changes,"" Ms Bishop said. 

As Russia has stepped up its engagement in the region, the US and allies including Australia have come to accept that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad may have to remain in place as part of a political deal to restore peace to the region and prosecute the war on IS. 

The US is still casting this as a possible temporary measure, while Ms Bishop has said no potential political solution should be discarded. 

""In Syria, as I said yesterday, defeating ISIL requires, I believe, a new leader and an inclusive government that unites the Syrian people in the fight against terrorism groups,"" Mr Obama told the summit. 

""This is going to be a complex process and as I've said before we are prepared to work with all countries, including Russia and Iran, to find a political mechanism in which it is possible to begin a transition process."" 

Mr Obama now appears to be caught between European allies who believe there should be more co-operation with Russia – which backs Mr Assad – and Middle Eastern allies, including Saudi Arabia, who still insist he must go. 

Russia refused to send a senior diplomat to the summit, dismissing it as American grandstanding. 

""This initiative seriously undermines UN efforts in this direction,"" Russia's UN envoy Vitaly Churkin was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies. 

""The UN has its own anti-terror strategy and everything could easily be done within the UN framework. 

""But Americans would not be Americans if they did not seek to demonstrate their leadership."" 

The Russian and American presidents traded barbs about the causes of the Syrian war in their speeches to the General Assembly a day earlier, with Mr Putin saying it had been provoked by American attempts to ""export democracy"".

1207,"Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere will require surgery to fix a hairline fracture in his left leg and is set to be out for around three months, the Barclays Premier League club announced on Tuesday. 
 
		 
Manager Arsene Wenger last week revealed the England international had suffered a ""little setback"" in his scheduled recovery from the injury sustained in pre-season. 
  Arsenal's Jack Wilshere is set for several weeks of rehabilitation following surgery   
Following further medical examinations, the decision has now been taken that an operation is needed to properly correct the problem and is likely to take place in the next few days. 

			 
A statement from Arsenal read: "" Due to a slow healing response from a fracture suffered in August, the club can confirm that Jack Wilshere is to undergo an operation to his left fibula. 



 
""The decision to intervene has been taken quickly after regular reviews by specialists, who feel that Jack's scans show that the healing process is not progressing as well as expected. 

""Jack will have surgery in London in the forthcoming days. This will involve inserting a small plate in his left fibula. Jack is likely to be out for approximately three months. 

""Everyone at the club wishes Jack well with his rehabilitation."" 

The news will come as a blow to both the player, who has battled through a  string of fitness issues in recent seasons, and club, with forward Danny Welbeck  also set for an extended spell on the sidelines until at least Christmas  following knee surgery. 

			 
Arsenal travel to Croatia for their Champions League opener against Dinamo  Zagreb on the back of a 2-0 home win over Stoke which sustained their recovery  in the Barclays Premier League. 

Forward Theo Walcott, who once netted a hat-trick playing for England at the  Maksimir Stadium, is pressing for another start after scoring the opening goal  against the Potters on Saturday. 

Defender Per Mertesacker is not expected to be involved having just recovered  from a virus and also being involved in a minor road traffic accident on Monday.

4060,"On Sunday, Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Jain ordered the purchase
 of 1,000 new beds to accommodate the surging number of dengue patients 
in hospitals. 


 Laxmichandra and Babita Rout had committed suicide after their 7-year-old son Avinash died due to suspected dengue.   
A seven-year-old boy's death followed by his parents' suicide has forced the government to wake up to the threat of dengue in Delhi. 

On Sunday, Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Jain ordered the purchase of 1,000 new beds to accommodate the surging number of dengue patients in hospitals. He also suggested that hospitals may postpone surgeries if possible to free beds for dengue patients, besides promising strict action against MCD staff members who were not executing fumigation work properly. 

The directions come in the wake of public outrage over a seven-year-old's death due to suspected dengue followed by his parents ending their lives by jumping off a building. Laxmichandra and Babita Rout, who hail from Odisha, had taken their only child Avinash to five private hospitals on September 7 but he was allegedly refused admission by the hospitals. After cremating him, the couple jumped off a four-storey building in Lado Sarai area of the Capital on Wednesday morning. 

The Capital is witnessing the worst dengue outbreak this year with 1,259 dengue cases being recorded so far. The number was reportedly higher only in 2010 when 1,512 cases were recorded in Delhi. 

Health Minister Jain on Sunday held a meeting of the health secretary, divisional commissioner and directors of local bodies. ""In view of the rise in dengue cases, I have ordered to buy 1,000 new beds within the next three or four days. If hospitals lack space, the new beds can be kept in lobbies or wherever space is available,"" Jain said after the meeting. 

The minister also suggested that hospitals may postpone surgeries if possible to make beds available for dengue patients. ""Hospitals have been asked to postpone surgeries by one month... our first priority is to treat such (dengue) patients,"" he said. Jain issued directions to all DMs, SDMs and tehsildars to closely monitor dengue cases in their wards. 

Jain accused the three municipal corporations of shirking away from their duty to control the mosquito menace. ""We have got several complaints from people that the MCD staff do not visit their homes (for fumigation), which is unacceptable. 

The government will take strict action against those who do not work properly,"" Jain said. The minister also acknowledged the infrastructure-related problems faced by the government while tackling the problem. 

""We do not deny that there are two patients on one bed but hospitals are working hard. We are working more on prevention... not much has been done regarding this. People should get admitted to hospital only after consulting a doctor and not out of panic,"" he said. 

Meanwhile, the Congress on Sunday attacked the Centre and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal over the issue. 

Party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said, ""Hospitals are directly under your (Delhi CM) supervision. In the Capital, a healthy child dies one day due to a disease and parents have to commit suicide. You are spending Rs 700 crore on advertisements. You could have given at least Rs 70 crore of this to Delhi hospitals to save lives.""",1ed73c81-20aa-473a-a6c9-a7c5ebddefb2,News,2015-09-14T03:17:06Z,India Today,Delhi: Suicide shock jolts AAP government into action,0.0,News

The Falcons trail Maryland 13-6 at halftime. 
 
HALFTIME 
 
The Bowling Green State University football team trails Maryland 13-6 at halftime at Byrd Stadium today. 
 
The Falcons drove 82 yards on their first drive of the second quarter, and Matt Johnson hit Derek Lee with a 5-yard ""shovel"" pass with 12:05 left in the quarter. BG tried for a trick-play two-point conversion and failed. 
 
Then the Terrapins returned the ensuing kickoff to their own 48, and eventually settled for a 23-yard field goal by Brad Craddock. 
 
Late in the second quarter the Falcons pushed down to Maryland's 30 but failed to convert on fourth down. 
 
FIRST QUARTER 
 
The Bowling Green State University football team trails Maryland 10-0 after the first quarter from Byrd Stadium.

If you’ve read any writings on writing, I’m sure you’ve seen some variation on the theme “protect the work”.  Successful writers carve out time to write and guard that time as sacred.
Yes of course you think as you read it. How will I ever become a writer/meet my writing goals if I don’t sit down and WRITE? Turns out in practice, that’s harder to execute. I don’t know about you, but as a working mom who is also trying to complete the first draft of her novel, I juggle so many balls, it’s hard to execute that protection order. 
But, sometimes? Sometimes I am my own worst enemy. I could protect the work, but I don’t, not because I don’t want to, but because I don’t believe in the value of what I’m doing. That’s PAID work, it MUST come first. Surely that non-profit organization needs my time and efforts more than my silly little story. My brain is a manipulative witch sometimes. I know my strengths and when a client, or group I belong to needs me to fill a role that plays to my strengths instead of protecting the work, I say yes. It’s the path of least resistance and it’s instant gratification. I’ve got a decent track record in marketing, communications and event planning. So I’ll do those for the positive strokes rather than toil on my writing where it’s a long, lonely and uncertain road.  Don’t get me wrong, I have lots of support but no one can get THIS story down on paper but me. 
This all came to a head recently. I feel strongly that non-profits are can be only truly successful when all members contribute. This particular commitment had changed in a way I hadn't anticipated. As I planned out my day in my head, I realized that in order to address this change, I was going to have to sacrifice my writing time. That stopped me in my tracks. I’ve been on a roll lately, adding on average 1,000 words a day to my WIP 4-5 days a week. To some that seems a paltry sum, but to me, it’s a fantastic amount. More important to me was the consistency. I was loathe to break that streak. 
It was a weird feeling to put MY work first, but I did it and in the end, it was the right decision for me. You know what? The world won’t end and my novel is one step closer to getting finished. 
I realized that as often as I’ve heard “protect the work”, I was still waiting for some magical superhero to come in and guard my writing time, or for someone else to say ""no you can't do that, you have to write"". Heh, turns out, *I* have the super powers. *I* protected the work. 
I did it this time, but I’m not naive.  There will be other times and other challenges. Knowing my personality, I’m always going to need to suck it up and say “but this matters to ME.”  As a matter of fact, if you’ll excuse me, I have some words to write.

Is protecting the work easy for you, or is it a challenge?",7c388005-daef-4af5-878c-1152c763353e,Blog,2015-09-15T12:00:43Z,Live to Write - Write to Live,Protecting The Work,1.0,News

(Reuters) - The U.S. national healthcare reform law has extended health insurance coverage to 17.6 million Americans, according to a new government report on Tuesday, up from its previous estimate of 16.4 million. 
 
The number of uninsured has decreased because of changes in the law that allowed young people to stay on their parents' health plans for longer, the expansion of Medicaid in 29 states and the District of Columbia, and the sale of subsidized health insurance to individuals, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a speech. 
 
The previous estimate, which is calculated by a division of HHS, was issued in March.

539,"HAIFA, Israel, Sept. 10, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pluristem Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq:PSTI) (TASE:PSTI), a leading developer of placenta-based cell therapy products, reported yesterday financial results for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, and provides corporate and financial highlights for fiscal year 2015.

""During fiscal 2015 we executed our strategy to shorten the time to commercialization for PLX-PAD, our lead product, and significantly advanced the development of PLX-R18, our second product,"" said Zami Aberman, Pluristem's Chairman and CEO.

""We achieved a major milestone when our clinical development program for PLX-PAD in critical limb ischemia (CLI) was selected for Europe's Adaptive Pathways pilot project. Only a handful of programs were chosen worldwide. Pending a single successful Phase II trial, PLX-PAD could enter the European market in 2018 with conditional approval to treat a type of CLI. Another important milestone was safety clearance of PLX-PAD cells for use in clinical trials in Japan.""

""We also advanced our U.S. program for PLX-R18 in the treatment of incomplete hematopoietic recovery following hematopoietic cell transplantation. This year we also announced an important new clinical finding from our Phase I/II trial in muscle injury, suggesting that treatment with PLX-PAD could also significantly strengthen muscle force in the contralateral leg.

""During fiscal 2015, we strengthened our valued partnerships with United Therapeutics, Cha Bio and the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and finished the fiscal year with a robust balance sheet. We look forward to a very productive fiscal 2016 on all fronts,"" Mr. Aberman concluded.

Clinical and Corporate Highlights for Fiscal Year 2015 Include:

During fiscal 2015, Pluristem raised net cash of $17.2 million from issuance of common stock, and from exercises of outstanding warrants and options. The fundraise marked the accomplishment of a goal to increase US institutional ownership. In addition, the Company was awarded $2.9 million grant from the Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS) of Israel's Ministry of Economy to support R&D programs, as well as a ""Smart Money"" grant from Israel's Ministry of the Economy to support marketing activities in Japan. As of June 30, 2015, Pluristem had $53.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits, restricted deposits and marketable securities. The Company expects this will support its activities for the next two years.

About Pluristem Therapeutics Pluristem Therapeutics Inc. is a leading developer of placenta-based cell therapy products. The Company has reported robust clinical trial data in multiple indications for its patented PLX (PLacental eXpanded) cells. The cells release a cocktail of therapeutic proteins in response to inflammation, ischemia, hematological disorders, and radiation damage. PLX cell products are grown using the Company's proprietary three-dimensional expansion technology. They are off-the-shelf, requiring no tissue matching prior to administration.

Pluristem has a strong intellectual property position; Company-owned, GMP-certified manufacturing and research facilities; strategic relationships with major research institutions; and a seasoned management team.

For example, we are using forward-looking statements when we discuss PLX-PAD's potential to enter the European market in 2018 with conditional approval to treat a type of CLI, when we discuss our preparation for submission of an Investigational New Drug application to FDA for PLX-R18 in the treatment of incomplete hematopoietic recovery following hematopoietic cell transplant, when we discuss PLX-R18's potential to improve the outcome of bone marrow transplantation, and when we discuss our expectation that our current cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits, restricted deposits and marketable securities will support its activities for the next two years. These forward-looking statements and their implications are based on the current expectations of the management of Pluristem only, and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements: changes in technology and market requirements; we may encounter delays or obstacles in launching and/or successfully completing our clinical trials; our products may not be approved by regulatory agencies, our technology may not be validated as we progress further and our methods may not be accepted by the scientific community; we may be unable to retain or attract key employees whose knowledge is essential to the development of our products; unforeseen scientific difficulties may develop with our process; our products may wind up being more expensive than we anticipate; results in the laboratory may not translate to equally good results in real clinical settings; results of preclinical studies may not correlate with the results of human clinical trials; our patents may not be sufficient; our products may harm recipients; changes in legislation; inability to timely develop and introduce new technologies, products and applications; loss of market share and pressure on pricing resulting from competition, which could cause the actual results or performance of Pluristem to differ materially from those contemplated in such forward-looking statements.

3305,"Afghanistan News.Net  Friday 18th September, 2015  
 During the last fortnight, we have been a witness to the recollection of various battles fought during the India -Pakistan War of 1965. The display at India Gate gives us a vivid account of those operations. 
The war had followed the conflict in Kutch earlier that year, as well as the massive infiltration into Jammu and Kashmir in the summer and the invasion of Chaamb -Jaurian on September 1. 
 
The Indian Army tried its best to halt the advance of the Pakistan Army in Chhamb. The Indian Air Force also tried to stop the invading Pakistanis, but suffered heavy losses. 
 
India responded by invading Pakistan on September 6. The thrust was towards Lahore from three directions, from Wagah to Dograi on the Grand Trunk Road, from Harike-Khalra to Burki and Khem Karan-Kasur Axis. 
 
Though posted in Shillong and on leave, I joined duty. Posted as public relations officer for the Lahore Sector with my office in Amritsar, I had the opportunity of covering the war in that sector. 
 
The war was not expected to conclude the way it did by many experts in the West. To start with, many analysts thought that by attacking India in the Chhamb sector, Pakistan had played an ace. Western press correspondents, who went with the forward echelons of the Pakistan Army, wrote glowing reports of its performance. 
 
The impression was that Pakistan Army and Air Force was better equipped. The impression was that the Patton tanks were invincible as compared to World War II vintage Shermans and Centurions that India had. The Sabres and supersonic Starfighter of the PAF were considered far superior to the Indian Vampires and Myster 
 
es. So also the B-57 Bombers to the Canberras and Hunters that the Indian Air Force had. No one thought of the dimunitive Gnat, which proved to be more than its weight during the war 
 
To start with, there was a great deal of criticism of India for not giving access to the theatre of war to the press, particularly the foreign press, during the war. Much of the criticism was based on the precedent when India kept the media at arms length during the 1962 operations against China. 
 
It took almost a week for the Government of India to give access to the media to the theatre of operations. I had the privilege of covering the attack by the Pakistan Air Force on Kalaikunda I was passing through Kharagpur, when the attack was in progress. I got down at the station and rushed to the base at Kalaikunda, and could take a picture of the Pakistan Air Force aircraft shot down by us. My Director, G.G. Mirchandani, appreciated my effort and posted me to Amritsar. 
 
I boarded an Indian Air Force aircraft going from Barrackpore to Delhi, got myself briefed and proceeded to Amritsar. During the rest of the war, I was on the move, along the road to Khem Karan, Burki, and on the Wagh -Lahore Axis. The formation in charge of the operations was the II Corps, commanded by Lt.Gen. Jogi Dhillon. 
 
I had the opportunity of taking press parties to Burki, and showing them Burki village, which was captured by us. I also took media persons and got briefed by Brigadier Theograj of the 2nd Armoured Brigade, as to how we were able to water the fields and make easy targets of the Patton tanks, which got bogged down. Lt. Col A.S. Vaidya and Lt Col Salim Caleb, who commanded armoured regiments briefed us on how they were able to attack the Pattons. Both of them won the Maha Vir Chakra. 
 
The Pakistan Army, which had made advances into Khem Karan, saw fierce battles at Asal Uttar. The Armoured Division of the Pakistan Army withdrew and moved to Sialkot where we had opened a new front. 
 
I had met Lt.Col. Desmond Hayde, the Commanding Officer of the 3 Battalion of the Jat Regiment, who had reached Dograi on the 6th of September. But, as the supporting troops did not reach, he had to fall back. He told me that he planned to recapture Dograi on 22nd September evening. 
 
We had heard that the war was going to conclude soon after midnight on September 22 as per the resolution of the Security Council of September 20 
 
I decided to go to the Wagah on the previous day. As I drove, I heard shells whizzing past. As the evening approached, heavy shelling stated and I was invited by a unit commander to come to his dug-out , which I did. I was advised that returning to Amritsar was out of question because of the heavy shelling. 
 
At dawn, I drove to Dograi unsure about the outcome of the battle. As I reached Dograi, I was told that we had succeeded in pushing the Pakistanis beyond the Icchogil Canal after a fierce battle. One witnessed devastation all round. At Dograi, I witnessed some Pakistani trucks being loaded with the dead bodies of Pakistan soldiers. The stench was overpowering. 
 
Around noon, some well-clad civilians from Amritsar drove down from Amritsar. They were joined soon by some pyjama-kurta clad persons from Lahore. They seemed to know each other and the usual warm greetings and hugs followed. A Pakistan Junior Commissioned Officer, who was supervising the collection of Pakistani dead solders, could not hide his anguish When he saw the civilians hug one another, and he remarked to me: ""Major Saheb, these people make us fight and kill each other, but see what they are doing."" 
 
Through wireless, I had contacted my office in Amritsar and sent a message to Delhi. Media representatives were flown to cover the events. 
 
War over, one felt that public interest would also fade. But the number of press correspondents visiting the area was on the upswing. Dogri, Burki, Asal Uttar continued to be generate news stores. The Western Press was keen to find out why the Patton tanks suffered the fate they did. A visit to Patton Nagar near Bhikhiwind was a must for the foreign press.

5465,"Brian Foshee may be the most interesting man in the world because he successfully tackles the role of a professional magician, stay at home father, amateur hang glider, and is now tackling the role as a successful inventor of the Empower Sound product line.

“I have always enjoyed watching the smile on the face of my audience when I perform magic,” Foshee says. “After inventing the Empower Sound line, I now have the pleasure of hearing so many positive responses from performers across the country that use my high quality products.”

Foshee’s Empower Sound product line can best be described as mobile, convenient, and built with the performer in mind. Whether someone performs comedy, magic, or does speaking engagements, Empower Sound provides a solution. The Empower Sound line includes, but is not limited to: all in one portable PA systems; wireless microphones; speakers; special music players with secret remote controls; and numerous accessories that are great for performers of all skill levels.

“As a performer, I know a little about all that can go right, but even more about what can go wrong when you are standing in front of a crowd. I decided to make the Empower Sound line based on the experiences I have had and the need to control all aspects of the performance myself.”

In addition to the Happie Amp/Amazing Amp, Jr. Pro, and UHF Pro, Foshee will be releasing his newest product soon. The newest product is the cutting edge, Empower Sound Ultimate Control BT. It combines an Mp3 player with secret remote control and Bluetooth connectivity. This device will have techies raving because of its iPhone/iPad/Android app capability. It will also be battery powered for use anywhere.

Foshee says, “Performers everywhere should know Empower Sound has their back. The MP3 player is just another example of me bringing control back to the performer so they do not have to worry as much about unexpected, technical difficulties. I am sure it will be magical, pardon the pun.”

The Empower Sound products are equally as interesting and creative as their inventor.

512,"It's been roughly a week since Texans starting inside linebacker Mike Mohamed suffered a calf injury, and he's still experiencing soreness as he works his way…  
When the Texans got on the scoreboard Sunday with a DeAndre Hopkins touchdown catch, veteran kicker Randy Bullock lined up for his first extra-point attempt of the season and promptly missed it wide right. 

It was the first missed extra point of Bullock’s career after making his previous 66 extra points in his first two NFL seasons. 

This is part of what the NFL intended when it passed a new rule in March moving the extra point back to the 15-yard line. The league wanted to make the play more demanding and encourage NFL teams to increase two-point conversion tries.

What colours really stand out in this picture?
Why do you think the artist called this picture Yellow Islands?

This term in Computing we are going to use technology to paint a picture. Over the next few weeks we are going to learn some of the features of Paint so we can make ‘draw’ or ‘paint’ the best picture we can on the computer.

First we need to load the program – we need to find the correct icon – It might not be on the main page but in the program menu – in accessorise!

This week we are going to use the brushes tool and fill tool to create our own version of Yellow Island.



Brushes allow us to leave marks like lots of different types of pens, pencils and brushes.



The paint can lets us fill a space with lots of colour – but be careful any gaps and the paint will pour out!

– remember what colour is in in color (American spelling of colour!) is the colour you will draw or paint.

One of the most important things we will learn today is UNDO – if we don’t like what we have just done we can undo it – take it off the page – in Art with paint this is something we can’t do – What does the icon look like? If you reply on the blog this week you will get a BEST point.

Once we have drawn our picture we will need to save it carefully.",762f2e02-762c-49be-8fc3-2a8d4b845bc6,Blog,2015-09-15T11:42:30Z,A window into our Year 2 Classroom.,Paint a Picture.,1.0,Blog

9760,"The post 4 Tasks That Will Save Your Email Marketing Campaigns appeared first on HostGator Blog | Gator Crossing . 
 

 
On the internet, email is like having a mobile phone, with the difference that on the internet — you can almost always get anyone’s phone number, at any given time. Sometimes, you create something and ask users to enter their phone number (email) in for you, so that they can be notified when you share and publish more of the amazing stuff that got the interested in the first place. We now it by the name of email marketing. 
 
The reasons for creating an email list have long been known and understood by expert marketers, and we recently published a post ourselves, about the reasons why a small business should invest in an email marketing strategy , and how rewarding it can be. It’s without question the leading way of staying in touch with your customers and peers of interest. 
 
If you’r new to email marketing, or have done it a few times before, you will be familiar with email marketing campaigns — in simpler words, it simply means to send out a carefully crafted message and/or announcement to everyone who has signed up to be on your email list. And more often than not, we want these emails to be of highest quality so as to retain the subscribers, but also to convert leads where possible. 
 
  
 1. Talk to Your Customers  
Marketing always was and always will be about the customer, there is no denying that. These days there are countless ways of connecting with your customers, social media and content marketing being a few of them, but email is usually the one that plays on the more personal level. And there is nothing more dissatisfying than a corporate email that only wants to sell you something. 
 
When sending a new campaign: 
  Always greet your customers by their first name, which means you have to find a way to collect their name as well. It’s a nice and personal touch.  Don’t drag the email for too long only to try and sell something at the end. Bring value to the table.  Give them a good initiative to continue reading the email at the top, rather than the bottom.   
  
 2. Optimize the Email Experience  
The mobile experience can now provide just as many features and possibilities as a full-blown desktop computer, and with that in mind, the usage of mobile devices for business and personal needs has increased dramatically over the last few years, even months some would say. And with that in mind, we need to make sure we’re catering to our mobile users the same way we are to desktop users. 
 
A mobile device is usually going to require a responsive email design that can naturally adapt to the needs of the mobile device. The impact of responsive emails in terms of open rates, and conversion rates, is too huge to miss out on. 
 
  
 3. Test What Works  
In development, programmers test their applications against common errors and performance optimization, in email — we can use testing to test what works best for us and our subscribers, including the email design, the titles we choose to have, and the overall email experience we provide. It’s easy to get started . 
 
Testing allows you to compare and contrast different elements of your email campaigns to see how they impact your subscribers’ reactions to them. You can form a hypothesis about what you think will occur, and then formulate a test and find out what really happens . 
 
  
 4. Email Campaign Frequency  
The last task on our list is actually less a task, but more of a reminder to those who are eager to build their email list quickly. It’s easy to get carried away with having access to so many people at any given time, and sometimes we may feel that sending out a few emails a week is going to increase our conversion rates significantly, that simply is not true. 
 

 
Even before you begin sending out your first emails, you should get clear about the email marketing strategy that you’re going to be using, and whether sending out multiple emails on weekly basis is going to yield you the best result. It’s possible to ask your new subscribers to select the frequency of emails they’d like to receive, but then you’ve to be completely clear about the message you’re trying to convey over your email campaigns. 
 
Sometimes as frequently as twice a month is enough to capture the attention of your customers, and customers-soon-to-be. MailChimp fully agrees that more is not always better .

Hundreds of migrants streamed into Germany on Sunday to cheers and ""welcome"" signs, joining the thousands who arrived the previous day as Austria called for an emergency EU summit on the continent's worst refugee crisis since World War II. 

Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann warned his country's admittance of thousands of refugees crossing from Hungary was just a ""temporary"" measure and urged the 28-member European Union to collectively deal with the record numbers. 

Masses of people fleeing war and misery from Syria, Iraq and beyond have rushed from Hungary through Austria into Germany, which expects to take in 800,000 refugees this year at a cost of 10 billion euros ($11 billion). 

In moving scenes the newcomers, clutching their children and sparse belongings, stepped off trains in Munich, Frankfurt and elsewhere to cheers from well-wishers who held balloons, snapped photos and gave them water and food. 

""The people here treat us so well, they treat us like real human beings, not like in Syria,"" said Mohammad, a 32-year-old from the devastated town of Qusayr, his eyes welling up with tears. 

With the EU divided along east-west lines on how to handle the record numbers, Pope Francis called for every Catholic parish to take in a refugee family. 

On Saturday alone about 8,000 migrants crossed German borders, federal police told AFP. 

In Munich, some 1,200 came in early Sunday, a day after trains brought 6,800 to the southern German city. 

As refugees got off trains, police directed them to waiting buses bound for temporary shelters, which have been set up in public buildings, hotels and army barracks across the country. 

""Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here,"" crowds chanted at the Frankfurt railway station overnight. 

While Germany has seen a spate of ugly xenophobic rallies and attacks against foreigners, it has also seen an outpouring of support, donations and volunteer efforts by people who believe the country, given its dark history and current wealth, has a special obligation to help refugees. 

- Humanitarian emergency - 

Nonetheless, politicians in Germany and elsewhere in Europe have voiced growing concern about the record numbers, and warned the influx would spell both logistical and political problems. 

In Austria, Faymann said that Vienna's assistance was a temporary manifestation of Vienna's ""goodwill"" in the face of a humanitarian emergency. 

""There is no alternative to a common European solution,"" said Faymann, calling for a summit of EU leaders ""immediately after"" an interior ministers' meeting on September 14, the APA news agency reported. 

German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Saturday spoke by phone with Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has called the refugee wave a ""German problem"" caused by Berlin's public statement saying it would welcome Syrians. 

""Both sides agreed that both Hungary and Germany must meet their European obligations, including their obligations under the Dublin agreement,"" said Merkel's spokesman Georg Streiter. 

Under the EU's so-called Dublin rules, asylum applications must be processed by the country where a person first arrives. 

Orban and Merkel had agreed that the weekend influx was exceptional, due to the emergency situation in Budapest, Streiter said. 

Merkel also faces political pressure at home, where her Bavarian sister party CSU criticised the eased travel rules as ""a wrong decision"", according to its party secretary Andreas Scheuer. 

Members had warned that this had created ""an additional pull-factor"" - aside from push factors such as war, poverty and repression in their home countries. 

Merkel was set to hold a crisis meeting on the refugee issue later Sunday with her coalition partners. 

- Europe divided - 

Europe is deeply divided over how to handle the continent's biggest refugee crisis since the end of World War II, and Hungary's and other eastern European nations' hard line has contrasted with a show of solidarity elsewhere in Europe. 

Finnish Prime Minister Juha Sipila has evern offered to put up refugee families in his country home. 

Under intensifying pressure at home and abroad, British Prime Minister David Cameron is set to admit 15,000 refugees from Syria, the Sunday Times reported. 

Pope Francis called for ""every parish, every religious community, every monastery, every sanctuary in Europe take in a family."" 

The UN refugee agency UNHCR on Saturday said 366,402 migrants had crossed the Mediterranean to Europe this year, with 2,800 dying or going missing en route. 

European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has proposed relocating 120,000 refugees from overstretched Italy, Greece and Hungary, a European source has told AFP. 

The plan -- which comes on top of a Commission proposal in May for the relocation of 40,000 migrants -- is expected to be formally unveiled by Juncker on Wednesday after being approved by Commissioners, the source said. 

Germany's Welt am Sonntag newspaper reported that under Juncker's plan, Germany would take in about 31,000 people, followed by France with 24,000 and Spain with almost 15,000.

As indispensable as possessing interpretational skills is, people ought to be aware of its value and the opportunities it tends to create so as to bring in more people in this field as there will always be situations where a professional is required to interpret and pass on messages that are not understandable to others. This is where interpretation and translation services comes in handy as they help individuals, business people lawyer and the government in communicating despite their language barrier. 
 
With the world developing to be a global community whereby people from different continents unite with one goal of strengthening the human race by sharing all the resources that everyone bring on the table, there is the need to either find a universal language or learn a couple of them in order to enhance this transition as nothing can be accomplished without proper communication. 
 
Previously, these services have been seen being rendered in churches where a translator is needed to pass the message to those are not conversant with the language the preacher is using; in making diplomatic agreements between different countries and basically just in different scenarios where a third party is necessary in passing out messages. 
 
Today, the deaf community have even rose up to the occasion whereby they have people representing them in different platform such as in the media in a bid to help them translate the information passed o to the general public. This has somehow gave them a voice as they can connect to the world on a higher level and with time they will not feel as alone as they were a few decades ago. 
 
In efforts to seek a translator, there are some factors that need to be put into consideration such as the beliefs and moral values of this translator. This is so because they can affect their performance in the sense that they may omit or pass wrong messages intentionally in order to favor what they believe in which is not translation or interpretation should be all about. 
 
With its popularity growing with every passing year, more people have been seen venturing in this field due to the opportunities it creates as has now become a career path that people can follow and benefits from. Companies however are known to perform bigger tasks such as translating books and software used in electronic gadgets in either textual or oral conversions. 
 
With everything being computerized today, there has been a move to advance this service making it more efficient and self reliant through the inventions of computerized gadgets and applications that enables this. With this, there are no inconveniences caused unlike when using a human translator and there is also the aspect of time efficiency. 
 
However, as efficient as technology can be one cannot compare it to having an onsite interpreter as they bring sense to phrases that these gadgets cannot. Even so, the ICT brings about not only efficiency but privacy whereby one may need translation for information that is confidential and cannot be trusted to anyone.

4172,"When your company is known for making wireless routers, network switches and home security cameras, leaking your code-signing private keys  is the last thing you want to do. Back in February, that's exactly what D-Link did, accidentally leaving a valid key visible in its open-source firmware.

5629,"The last time Jim Harbaugh coached a football game showed he why he is so coveted. 

On Dec. 28, 2014, in Santa Clara, Calif., the San Francisco 49ers were preparing for their regular-season finale in a home game. 

Harbaugh had been told weeks earlier that he wouldn't be returning as coach for 2015 and, despite him not telling almost anyone, it was obvious to everyone and the media crush locally and nationally was intense. 

Everyone knew what was coming, building the chaos to a feverishly awkward pitch that day. Thousands of fans arrived early that day to cheer him as he took the field. Only one night earlier at the Santa Clara Marriott, fans hollered at him as he walked by between meetings. 

Yet Harbaugh still got his team to perform in a 20-17 win over Arizona. 

That scene translates a few hundred miles east Thursday, as Harbaugh debuts in his new job as coach of the Michigan football team at Utah. Kickoff is set for 8:30 p.m. on Fox Sports 1. 

The environment will be hostile, the opponent overlooked and the swirl again enormous. The masses wonder how he will be, how his team will react. 

If recent history is a guide, Harbaugh will barely notice. 

He was proud that day in Santa Clara because he got his players to focus on the work, which is what he does. Many times this offseason he has said he enjoys a day of practice as much as coaching in the Super Bowl. 

It may be a bit exaggerated, but the sentiment is legitimate - the man acts big but lives small. 

A major reason for his success is those blinders, able to push aside the tumult and live in that moment. 

There are times that his life gets complicated, when he's mentally in another world during a conversation to his constant crush of ideas, unrestrained and left to someone else to implement. 

On the field, though, where he has shined as a coach and player for more than 30 years, it's home. 

Even if it's someone else's home. 

When Harbaugh was introduced as Michigan's coach Dec. 30, he talked about the job being his dream since he was young and he has spent the past eight months living that. 

The hype and attention he has brought has exceeded even his imagination, the means to a recruiting end. 

Yet he understands the Wolverines will be judged on the field, by their results. Last year that was 5-7 with a 26-10 loss to these Utes. But it wasn't his team. 

Many big-school coaches get to ease into a job, facing a team with far less talent and prestige, at their own stadium. But the easy path has never been the Harbaugh way. 

So while he surely cringed when realizing this was the Wolverines' season-opening lot - a game sealed by former U-M athletic director Dave Brandon and former coach Brady Hoke, signed as they basked in the glow of an 11-2 season - he never made it publicly an excuse. 

""This is what we signed up for,"" he said last week. 

Even before the game began, Harbaugh's impact has been felt in the program. He overhauled the internal recruiting process, he brought in assistants who are teaching fresh techniques, and he has pushed the players physically and mentally much further than they feared. 

There's little explanation: to players, the public or even his coaches. 

So while Thursday night's altitude was mentioned, it was never stressed. While the all-white uniforms (from his earliest memories on the 1973-75 Wolverines) were revealed, they were never celebrated. 

Harbaugh has made no promises about expectations for this game, let alone this season, not necessarily because he is trying to keep his players' mind focused but his rarely goes there. 

His players are told: ""Don't talk about it, be about it."" 

Just last week, during a punt drill, he was standing among the receivers, trying to catch the high flyers as they dropped. A few landed in his arms and a few bounded away. But he was focused. 

""It's stuff where he throws himself into the mix,"" linebacker Desmond Morgan said. ""He's like no other head coach I've been around. He really gets involved."" 

For many coaches, eight months of external chaos would build to a crushing weight on the first game. 

Millions will tune in to see how he reacts and, to a lesser extent, his team. 

Given his history, though, Thursday night will be a release for Harbaugh, who will barely notice anything but the field.",e83b7f80-6d57-41e8-864a-1d26bd5d2587,News,2015-09-02T08:00:00Z,Fresno Bee,"Michigan faces pressure, but Jim Harbaugh can handle it",0.0,Blog

With Spring comes a sense of hope for warm weather ahead and anticipation for vacations and Summer Fridays to come. Tracy Reese played on that sense of elation and good cheer for her Spring 2016 collection which was downright pretty, chock full of girlishness, shimmer, and sheer detailing for a flash of skin. 
 

 

 

 
We all know that florals for Spring aren’t groundbreaking (thanks Miranda Priestly), but they felt fresh here on an easy off-the-shoulder dress, leggy mini frock paired with a studded yellow coat and black sheer tights, a bold maxi number layered under a cropped leather biker jacket, and an easy camisole given added flair with a lace sheer blouse and easy rust trousers. 
 

 

 

 
Lace overlays injected a dose of old school femininity to a glamorous sequin slipdress, a roomy printed coat, lime green bralette for a pop of color, and relaxed pants. 
 

 

 

 
Separates made a huge impact with button-accented tops, flirty knee-length skirts, and printed jacket and trouser combinations that played on the pajama trend. The shoes were also a focal point of the looks— designed in collaboration with Sarah Jessica Parker. 
 

 

 

 
Reese is best known for her dresses and there were some FLOTUS-worthy frocks in the collection. A printed short-sleeve crepe dress was pleasant and would work with the assortment’s icy blue booties or sneakers, while a white lace fishtail gown was one step away from bridal-perfect, save for its sheerness. 
 

 

 

 
My favorite pieces on display were those that were simple in silhouette, but adventurous in color. A copper caped playsuit is standout enough to last in a modern-day woman’s wardrobe for years to come and a silver biker jacket will inject a rocker chic edge to everything from menswear-inspired suiting to the most prim and proper sheath.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has arrived in Washington for talks with US President Barack Obama. Key themes are expected to be Chinese cyber spying, economic policies and the territorial disputes in the South China Sea. 

Washington rolled out the red carpet for President Xi on Thursday evening, hastily replacing Vatican banners in front of the White House with Chinese flags. 

The Chinese president was greeted at Andrews Air Force Base by United States Vice President Joe Biden, soon after Pope Francis left the US capital for New York. Xi stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Biden as a band played the US and Chinese national anthems. 

A private working dinner between Xi and Obama was scheduled at the Blair House, the official US guest residence across the road from the presidential mansion. Washington officials said key issues of division would start to be addressed at the low-key meal. 

The two leaders took an informal walk to the dining venue from the White House's West Wing. 

The full pageantry of a state visit was to be reserved for Friday, when Xi will be given a 21-gun salute, and a formal summit and news conference will take place before a black-tie state dinner. Meanwhile, US first lady Michelle Obama was scheduled to take Xi's wife, Peng Liyuan, to the National Zoo, to see the giant pandas. 

Among the issues that divide the US and China is that of cyber security , with Washington threatening sanctions against Chinese companies and individuals that it claims have stolen US trade secrets. 

Pressure to 'open up' 

Obama is also expected to urge Xi to put into effect economic reforms that would make the Chinese economy more open to foreign competition. The US president was also thought likely to address China's increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea, where Beijing has been staging a military build up and land reclamation exercise. 

The issue of human rights could also find its way onto the agenda, but is not expected to be central. Protests were expected outside the White House from rights…",88eb2437-93ce-452d-ada0-905a90d0ccac,News,2015-09-25T01:13:28Z,MyInforms,China's Xi arrives in Washington DC for first state visit,0.0,News

Powerful images of three-year-old Aylan Kurdi’s body on a Turkish beach have dominated headlines across the world and highlighted the human face of the unfolding refugee crisis. 

His death has seen international outpourings of grief and calls for more to be done to help desperate Syrians fleeing conflict. 

In the Sydney Morning Herald, a tribute to the little boy has been printed anonymously. 

    

It reads: “Aylan, You did not deserve to drown in the coldness of water and the coldness of human indifference. 

“You were not a Migrant. You were not a Refugee. You were a 3 yr old little boy wanting to play safely, away from the threats of violence and war. 

“In Heaven, you will be nursed by those who held you, by those who kissed you and by those who risked everything in the hope of you reaching the shores safely.” 

It ends: “Rest In Peace Aylan Kurdi. May God forgive us for failing you.”

3624,"Patients will benefit from ""world-class care"" closer to home under new plans from the head of the NHS. 
 
NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens wants to protect the future of small regional hospitals and bring expertise in areas such as eye care and cancer to patients' doorsteps. 
 
In a speech to the  Confederation of British Industry (CBI) in London, Mr Stevens will set out how partnerships between leading NHS hospitals and smaller ones will drive up the quality of services. 
 
The new links involve some of the best hospitals in the country, including the Royal Marsden cancer hospital in London, the Christie cancer hospital in Manchester and Moorfields Eye Hospital in London. 
 
Hospitals that are excellent performers will form groups to raise standards, and will set up clinics and other services in local district general hospitals. 
 
For example, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust already runs 22 ""mini-centres"" in and around London alongside its main site. 
 
It will now produce a toolkit so other specialties - such as cancer - can replicate its model. 
 
Mr Stevens said: ""Rather than patients routinely having to travel to specialist centres, we want to test the idea of bringing that expertise to their local hospital. 
 
""So key departments in smaller local hospitals are in some cases now going to be run by some of the best hospitals in Britain, such as Moorfields, the Royal Marsden or the Christie.

4085,"HKTDC Survey: Industry Cautiously Optimistic on Market Prospects 

 HONG KONG, Sept 13, 2015 - (ACN Newswire) - The 34th edition of the Hong Kong Watch & Clock Fair ended its five-day run (8-12 September) at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre yesterday. The fair, which is the largest marketplace in the world for the timepiece industry, welcomed more than 19,600 buyers, up two per cent over the previous year. 

Watch the fair video here: https://youtu.be/ZkDkZ3v9zoo 

Organised by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), Hong Kong Watch Manufacturers Association Ltd and The Federation of Hong Kong Watch Trades and Industries Ltd., the fair saw encouraging growth in buyer numbers from several major markets including Italy, France, Australia, Korea, India, Vietnam and Iran. 

Swiss exhibitor numbers double 

To cater to the booming Asian demand for quality Swiss watches, the HKTDC introduced two new Swiss pavilions at the fair's Salon de TE; the Swiss Eminence pavilion, which brought seven prestigious Swiss brands and the Swiss Independent Watchmaking Pavilion (SIWP), which grouped seven independent watchmaking brands. The number of participating Swiss brands at this year's Watch & Clock Fair doubled compared to 2014, with more than 40 brands. 

SIWP representative and CEO of Pilo & Co. Amarildo Pilo, said the Hong Kong Watch & Clock Fair and Salon de TE are important trading platforms for the industry. He said he had met many Swiss brand owners visiting the fair as buyers, even if their companies were not exhibiting at the event. This demonstrates the high regard that Swiss watch traders have for Hong Kong's increasing importance for sourcing and marketing. Mr Pilo hoped to leverage the SIWP to introduce Swiss watchmaking to more international buyers. He said he had found more than 10 potential Asia-Pacific distributors for the two brands - Pilo & Co. and David Van Heim, including companies from the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore and Thailand. 

Hong Kong companies pushing ahead 

""Hong Kong Watch & Clock Fair provides an ideal platform for the industry to network and conduct business. Although Hong Kong's watch and clock industry has to battle rising rents and operating costs, it has been able to push ahead using its versatility and creativity,"" said HKTDC Deputy Executive Director, Benjamin Chau. ""The mid-range affordable luxury products Hong Kong has launched, the smart watches and accessories it developed and the e-tailing channels it opened, have attracted global attention. Although the effects of the debt crisis still loom in Europe, the United States is steadily recovering, and we believe the outlook for Hong Kong's watch and clock industry remains steady."" 

Hong Kong independent watch brand ANPASSA showcased its latest watch series at Salon de TE for the second year in a row. Among the brand's offerings was the wedding watch collection, which is made from pure gold and is a combination of the traditional wedding bracelet and the modern watch. The bracelet and watch can be worn as a single unit on a wedding day or as individual units for different occasions. Gary Ching, ANPASSA's founder, said his brand is dedicated to producing custom-made watches for their clients. He said about 80 per cent of their watches are exquisitely crafted tourbillons. The company sold over 200 pieces of tourbillons at the fair last year. This year, Mr Ching hoped to leverage the fair to let global buyers know that Hong Kong too has an independent watch brand. He said many overseas buyers had enquired about the wedding watch collection and he expected good sales to follow. 

Industry players eye the Asia-Pacific market 

Asia-Pacific consumers are becoming increasingly savvy about quality watch brands, and the European watch and clock industry - long revered for its design and craftsmanship - used the Watch & Clock Fair as a platform to develop the Asia-Pacific markets. First-time Danish exhibitor Copenhagen Watch Group owns two well-known Danish watch brands; Arne Jacobsen and Picto. The company joined the fair to find new distributors in markets they have not yet covered. Peter Henriksen, Copenhagen Watch Group CEO, said his company had met with buyers and distributors from Australia, the Chinese mainland and Singapore, and would be confirming the partnerships after further discussions. 

Catherine Chan, General Manager of Comtech Watches Company Limited, said the company expected to further expand its market through the fair. The company has successfully established contact with potential buyers from Korea, Japan, India, Myanmar and Russia. 

Global Buyers place on-site orders 

During the fair, the HKTDC organised close to 80 buying missions with nearly 4,200 buyers from around the world. Among them were many quality global buyers, such as US' Jorg Gray Timepiece, Switzerland's Swatch AG, Italy's Hausmann & Co., Germany's Junghans, Korea's LG Electronics and Japan's Neuve A. 

James Schaefer, representative of US buyer Jorg Gray Timepieces, indicated that the company's sales network spans the US, Canada, Europe, Japan and the Chinese mainland. He had identified three suppliers and said the company would buy US$100,000 worth of mechanical watches, quartz watches and automatic watches. 

German buyer Unique Time had already placed orders with its existing suppliers after spending a few days in Hong Kong. Parham Shaghafi, the company's CEO, said he was going to place orders worth US$150,000 with a few existing suppliers for alloy watches, stainless steel basic watches and stainless steel mechanical watches. He expected total orders placed at the fair would reach US$350,000, which represented about 10 per cent of their annual buying budget. 

ABISTE Corporation has 170 fashion outlets in Japan and its General Manager Naoko Gakuhari said they had met with 10 new suppliers and would place an order of US$200,000 of ladies' watches at the fair. 

Industry optimistic about the market in 2016 

To understand the visitors' views on such issues as market outlook, sourcing patterns, market and product trends and e-tailing, the HKTDC commissioned an independent research agency to conduct surveys on-site. The agency interviewed more than 1,100 buyers and exhibitors during the first three days of the fair. 

The surveys found that 40 per cent of buyers and close to 70 per cent of exhibitors anticipate the sourcing price or production/sourcing cost would increase next year. The majority of buyers and exhibitors are cautiously optimistic about the market situation in the coming year. 

Over 80 per cent of respondents expect the volume of products sold via Hong Kong to either remain the same or increase next year. Half of the buyers are currently sourcing from Hong Kong suppliers and 60 per cent said they would increase the sourcing volume in the next three years. The surveys also found that both buyers and exhibitors consider traditional markets such as Western Europe, North America, and emerging markets such as the Chinese mainland and ASEAN countries to be the major growth markets for the timepiece industry in the coming year. 

In terms of product and market trends, both buyers and exhibitors surveyed expect smart watches and quartz analogue watches to be the most popular categories in the coming year. Meanwhile, smart watches, fashion watches and leisure watches are expected to have the highest market potential. With product development strategies, most respondents consider watches with smart devices, seasonal trend collections and limited edition collections to be the top three sectors. Over 70 per cent of buyers were satisfied or very satisfied with the quality of watches from Hong Kong. Exhibitors generally considered quality, durability and functionality to be the top three attributes of Hong Kong's timepieces. 

Regarding e-tailing, the surveys found that e-tailing accounted for over 20 per cent of the timepiece industry's total business. The respondents expect e-tailing to grow steadily by over 10 per cent in the next two years, and fashion watches, leisure watches and sports watches would lead the products sold through this channel. 

The surveys also sought to understand the buyers' sourcing pattern and promotion channels. They found that most respondents consider trade fairs a major channel to contact new buyers and suppliers. In terms of sourcing pattern, buyers said they would now shorten the delivery lead-time, maintain a low stock level and place small orders. Some 60 per cent of respondents said they would place orders for 300 pieces or less. In terms of sourcing frequency, 40 per cent of buyers said they would place orders once every quarter. To cater to this sourcing pattern, the HKTDC set up an hktdc.com Small Orders display at the Watch & Clock Fair to feature more than 170 showcases offering products with minimum orders ranging from five to 1,000 pieces. The display attracted more than 7,000 buyers and generated around 12,000 business enquiries during the fair.
